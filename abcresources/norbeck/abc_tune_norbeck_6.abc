Buchimish (bucimis) is a dance in 15/16 from Shope and Western Thracia in Bulgaria.
It is similar to the Macedonian dance posednica and Greek kathistos.
The name "buchimish" means "hemlock".

Note the "strange" key signatures with both sharps and flats. These kinds of scales
come from Turkish and Arabic music and are common in Balkan music.

The uneven meter is 15/16 = 4+4+3+4/16
