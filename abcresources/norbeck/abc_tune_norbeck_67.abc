This file contains 14 songs (#201 - #214).

I've transcribed them as I remember them, which does not necessarily mean
that the lyrics are exactly as in the "original". This is part of the "folk process"
of transmitting songs. Often the lyrics are an amalgamation of several different
versions of the song.
The melody is often just an approximation (especially for the slow songs), and
does not include ornamentation, just the "bare bones". Also the key chosen
is one that fits my voice - transpose it to fit your voice.
The songs were learnt from sessions, from friends or from recordings.

W:It's far away I am today from scenes I roamed a boy,
W:And long ago the hour, I know, I first saw Illinois.
W:But time nor tide nor waters wide, could wean my heart away.
W:Forever true it flies to you, my own dear Galway Bay.
W:
W:Oh, grey and bleak, by shores and creek, the rugged rocks abound.
W:But sweet and green the grass between, as grows on Irish ground.
W:So friendship fond, all wealth beyond, and love that lives always.
W:Bless every home beside your foam, my dear old Galway Bay.
W:
W:Had I youth's blood and hopeful mood, and heart of fire once more.
W:For all the gold the world might hold, I'd never leave your shore.
W:I'd be content with whatever God sent, with neighbours old and grey.
W:And I'd lay my bones 'neath churchyard stones, beside you Galway Bay.
W:
W:The blessings of a poor old man, be with you night and day.
W:The blessings of a poor old man, whose heart will soon be clay.
W:It's all the heaven I'd ask of God, upon my dying day.
W:My soul to soar for evermore, above you, Galway Bay.

W:Oh, I am a year old kid, I'm worth scarcely fifteen quid.
W:I'm the kind of beast you might well look down on.
W:But my value will increase at the time of my decease,
W:For when I grow up I want to be a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:If you kill me for my meat, you won't find me very sweet.
W:Your palate I'm afraid I'll soon turn sour on.
W:Ah, but if you do me in for the sake of my thick skin,
W:You'll find I make a tasty little bodhr\'an.
W:
W:Now my parents Bill and Nan, they do not approve my plan,
W:To become a yoke for every yob to pound on.
W:Ah, but I would sooner scamper with a bang than with a whimper,
W:And achieve reincarnation as a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:I look forward to the day when I leave off eating hay,
W:And become a drum to entertain a crowd on.
W:And I'll make my presence felt with each well-delivered belt,
W:As a fully qualified and licensed bodhr\'an.
W:
W:And 'tis when I'm killed and cured, my career will be assured.
W:I'll be a skin you'll see no scum nor scour on.
W:But with studs around my rim, I'll be sound in wind and limb,
W:And I'll make a handy, dandy little bodhr\'an.
W:
W:Oh, my heart with joy expands when I dream of far-off lands,
W:And consider all the streets that I will sound on.
W:And I pity my poor ma, who will never see a Fleadh,
W:Or indulge in foreign travel as a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:Well a cat's lives they are nine, but they are not very fine,
W:And a dog has much material to growl on,
W:But it's when you are a goat, you can strike a merry note,
W:That's provided you have first become a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:For a hornpipe or a reel a dead donkey has no feel,
W:Or a horse or cow or sheep that has its shroud on.
W:And you can't join in a jig, as a former grade A pig,
W:But you can wallop out the lot if you're a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:So if e'er you're feeling low, to a session you should go,
W:And bring me there to exercise an hour on.
W:You can strike a mighty thump on my belly, back or rump,
W:But I thank you if you'd wait till I'm a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:When I dedicate my hide, I'll enhance the family pride,
W:And tradition is a thing I won't fall down on.
W:For I'll bear a few young bucks, who'll inherit my good looks,
W:And be proud to know their old one is a bodhr\'an.
W:
W:And I don't think I'll much mind, when I've left himself behind,
W:For the critter can no longer turn the power on.
W:For with a celtic ink design, tattooed on my behind,
W:I can be a very sexy little bodhr\'an.
W:
W:Now I think you've had enough of this rubbishy old guff,
W:So I'll put a sudden end to my wee amhr\'an.
W:And quite soon my bloody bleat, will become a steady beat,
W:When I start my new existence as a bodhr\'an.

W:An Irish boy was leaving, leaving his native home,
W:Crossing the broad Atlantic, where once more he wished to roam,
W:And as he was leaving his mother, while standing on the quay,
W:She threw her arms around his neck and these were the words she said:
W:
W:Chorus:
W:A mother's love is a blessing, no matter where you roam.
W:Keep her while she's living, you'll miss her when she's gone.
W:Love her as in childhood, though feeble, old and grey,
W:For you'll never miss a mother's love 'til she's buried beneath the clay.
W:
W:And as the years grow onward, I'll settle down in life,
W:And I'll find a nice young Irish girl, and take her for my wife.
W:And as the kids grow older, and climb about my knee
W:I'll teach them the very same lesson that my mother taught to me:

W:It being in spring and the small birds they were singing,

W:Where the thrushes they were warbling, the violets were charming,

W:She said, "My dear, don't leave me for another season

W:I'll forsake friends and relations and quit this Irish nation
W:And to the bonnie Bann banks forever I'll bid adieu."

W:
W:If you were in your bed lying and thinking on dying
W:One sight of the bonny Bann banks, your sorrow you'd give o'er
W:And if your were one hour, down in yon shady bower
W:Pleasure would surround you, you'd think on death no more.

W:And I being all alone, I sat down upon a stone
W:For to gaze upon the scenery of New York.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Oh then \'Erin gr\'a mo chro\'i you're the only land for me.
W:You're the fairest that my eyes did e'er behold.
W:You're the bright star of the west, the land Saint Patrick blessed.
W:You're the dear little isle so far away.
W:
W:It broke my mother's heart the day that I did part.
W:Will I ever see my dear folks anymore?
W:Not until my bones are laid in the cold and silent grave,
W:In my own native land so far away.
W:
W:It broke my mother's heart when from home I had to part.
W:Will I ever see my darling anymore?
W:Not until a judgement day when we both be far away,
W:In old Ireland far away o'er the foam.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:The turf will burn bright on the hearths at home tonight.
W:And the snow-flakes will fall fast a winter's day.
W:Saint Patrick's Day will come, and the shamrock will be wore,
W:In my own, my native land far away.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:On a cold, cold winter's night, with the turf fire burning bright
W:And the snowflakes falling on a winter's day
W:When St. Patrick's Day comes and the shamrocks will be worn
W:In the dear little isle so far away
W:
W:Chorus

W:As I went out walking one morning in June,
W:To view the fair fields and the valleys in bloom,
W:I spied a pretty fair maid, she appeared like a queen.
W:With her costly fine robes, and her mantle so green.
W:
W:Says I: "My pretty fair maid, won't you come with me?
W:We'll both join in wedlock, and married we'll be.
W:I'll dress you in fine linen, you'll appear like a queen,
W:With your costly fine robes, and your mantle so green."
W:
W:Says she: "Now my young man, you must be excused,
W:For I'll wed with no man, so you must be refused,
W:To the green woods I will wander and shun all men's view,
W:For the boy I love dearly lies in famed Waterloo."
W:
W:"Well if you're not married, say your lover's name.
W:I fought in that battle, so I might know the same."
W:"Draw near to my garment, and there you will see,
W:His name is embroidered on my mantle so green."
W:
W:In the ribbon of her mantle there I did behold,
W:His name and his surname in letters of gold,
W:Young William O'Reilly appeared in my view,
W:"He was my chief comrade back in famed Waterloo."
W:
W:"And as he lay dying, I heard his last cry."
W:"If you were here lovely Nancy, I'd be willing to die."
W:As I told her this story, in anguish she flew,
W:And the more that I told her, the paler she grew.
W:
W:So I smiled at my Nancy, "'Twas I broke your heart,
W:In your father's garden that day we did part,
W:And this is the truth, and the truth I declare,
W:Well here's your love token, a gold ring I wear."
