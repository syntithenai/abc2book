This file contains 100 songs (#101 - #200).

I've transcribed them as I remember them, which does not necessarily mean
that the lyrics are exactly as in the "original". This is part of the "folk process"
of transmitting songs. Often the lyrics are an amalgamation of several different
versions of the song.
The melody is often just an approximation (especially for the slow songs), and
does not include ornamentation, just the "bare bones". Also the key chosen
is one that fits my voice - transpose it to fit your voice.
The songs were learnt from sessions, from friends or from recordings.

W:I am a country servant, serving in Killane,
W:in a place they call New Hamilton, a grand old-fashioned town.
W:It was early one morning, at the hour of three,
W:when I set off to Clady, the old grey mare and me.
W:
W:In the corner of the street, a bus I chanced to pass,
W:and in the corner of the bus I spied a country lass.
W:Says I: "My pretty fair maid, will you come along with me?
W:I'm going the road to Clady, the old grey mare and me."
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Cheeks as red as roses, eyes a bonny blue,
W:dancing, dancing, pierced me through and through.
W:She fairly won my fancy, and stole away me heart,
W:jogging along to Clady on the sour milk cart.
W:
W:Well I asked her up beside me, and on the cart she sat,
W:I slipped an arm around her waist, we soon began to chat.
W:The birds in the bushes, how sweetly they did sing.
W:The blackbirds and the thrushes, how they made the forest ring.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Well you've heard of lords and ladies making love in shady bowers,
W:and how they woo a while among the roses and the flowers.
W:I'll never forget that morning, when Cupid shot his dart,
W:jogging along to Clady on the sour milk cart.

W:One morning in May, as I carelessly did stray,
W:to view the green meadows, and the lambs sport and play.
W:In the clear morning dew, as I sat down to muse,
W:a fair maiden of honour appeared in my view.
W:
W:I said: Pretty maid, how happy we could be,
W:for it is so ordained love, that married we should be.
W:Let me not see you frown, for this heart is your own.
W:When these words they were spoken, sure the tears trickled down.
W:
W:Come dry up your tears, there is nothing to fear,
W:I have roamed through the green fields for many's the long year.
W:While the birds sang so sweet, this young man proved his deceit,
W:saying: Adieu pretty fair maid, we shall never more meet.
W:
W:With my snuff box and cane, sure the whole world I would range,
W:like Venus or Diana in search of her swain,
W:while the moon does shine clear, I will mourn for my dear,
W:over mountains, clear fountains, where no one shall hear.
W:
W:There is one thing I know, and that before I go,
W:I will never return for to hear your sad woe.
W:And there's another thing I know, and that before I go,
W:that the ranger and the stranger have as many's the foe.

W:One fine summer's morning, both gallant and gay,
W:Twenty-four ladies went out on the quay,
W:And a regiment of soldiers it did pass them by,
W:A drummer and one of them soon caught his eye.
W:
W:He went to his comrade and to him did say,
W:"Twenty-four ladies I saw yesterday,
W:Oh, but one of them ladies she has me heart won,
W:And if she denies me I'm surely undone."
W:
W:"Go to this lady and tell her your mind
W:Tell her she's wounded your poor heart inside.
W:Go and tell her she's wounded your poor heart, full sore,
W:And if she denies you what can she do more?"
W:
W:So early next morning this young man arose,
W:Dressed himself up in a fine suit of clothes,
W:With a watch in his pocket and a cane in his hand,
W:Saluting the ladies he walked down the strand.
W:
W:He went up to her and he said "Pardon me,
W:Pardon me lady for making so free,
W:Oh my fine honored lady, you have my heart won,
W:And if you deny me I'm surely undone."
W:
W:"Be off little drummer, now what do you mean?
W:For I'm the lord's daughter of Ballycasteen.
W:Oh, I'm the lord's daughter that's honored, you see,
W:Be off little drummer, you're making too free."
W:
W:He put on his hat and he bade her farewell
W:Saying: "I'll send my soul down to heaven or hell.
W:For with this long pistol that hangs by my side,
W:Oh, I'll put an end to my own dreary life."
W:
W:"Come back little drummer, and don't take it ill,
W:For I do not want to be guilty of sin,
W:To be guilty of innocent blood for to spill.
W:Come back little drummer, I'm here at your will."

W:I'll tell yez how it was with me, if to listen yez are willin'.
W:'Twas in yon house behind yon hill, where I had lately been distillin'.
W:I swung a keg upon me back, and started out for daylight coolly.
W:Good customers I did not lack, and I sold it all in Ballyhooley.
W:
W:I thought it wiser to delay me homeward way for fear of peelers,
W:And in that way I spent the day, dinin' with the whiskey dealers.

W:I bid goodnight to all was there, and I started home from Ballyhooley.
W:
W:My heart was light with the mountain dew that I had brewed among the heather,
W:And on me way I chanced to spy a lad and lassie walk together.
W:Her neck was like the mountain snow, with cheeks like roses blossomed newly,
W:She'd a voice like music soft and low, she was the flower of Ballyhooley.
W:
W:This young man quickly left her side, it was afraid of me that he was,
W:And still the lassie did not hide, it was in love with me that she was,
W:Then quickly up beside her came, says I "Fair maid I love you truly!
W:And if your parents give consent will you be my bride in Ballyhooley?"
W:
W:"I have a house behind yon hill, two fine greyhounds and a ferret,
W:Besides I have a little still, the drop it makes with you I'll share it,
W:And I have got a feather bed, with sheets and blankets purchased newly,
W:Besides I have a ring to wed, if you'll be mine in Ballyhooley"
W:
W:Her cherry cheeks they grew more red, during the time that we were talkin',
W:And still she hung her little head, and viewed the ground where we were walkin',
W:She says "Young man if you're content, and if you say you love me truly,
W:And if me parents give consent, I'll be your bride in Ballyhooley."
W:
W:I asked her name she said it was Jane and that her second name was Cooley,
W:And then I asked her when we'd wed she said the sooner well the better,
W:So I went and asked her parents glad, if they were content to let me get her,
W:They said they were they wished us luck, we started out for Father Dooley,
W:And at the hour of twelve o'clock we tied the knot in Ballyhooley.
W:
W:The wedding that we had that day, the people comin' uninvited,
W:The piper played for every squad, Jane she sang and I recited,
W:The poteen flowed like a waterfall, that from the still had just come newly,
W:And in that way we gaily spent our honeymoon in Ballyhooley.
W:
W:The wedding presents that we got, none of them was mean or shabby,

W:"We were in bed, sir, every man,

W:A bloody battle then began
W:Upon the Haughs o' Cromdale.

W:They bathed their hooves in Hieland blood,

W:Upon the Haughs o' Cromdale.
W:
W:"But, alas, we could no longer stay,
W:So o'er the hills we cam away,
W:And sair we did lament the day
W:That e'er we cam tae Cromdale."

W:"Hieland men shall lead the way
W:For I will o'er the hills this day,
W:Tae view the Haughs o' Cromdale."

W:"But, alas, my lord, you're not so strong,

W:So boldly as they took the field,
W:And made their enemies to yield

W:The Gordons boldly did advance,
W:The Frasers fought with sword and lance,
W:The Grahams they made the heads tae dance,
W:Upon the Haughs o' Cromdale.
W:
W:Then the loyal Stewarts wi' Montrose,
W:So boldly set upon their foes,
W:Laid them low wi' Hieland blows
W:Laid them low on Cromdale.

W:A thousand fled tae Aberdeen,
W:The rest of them lie on the plain,

W:and the fair one's name was Mary Jane, the Star of Donegal.

W:To California's gold fields I'm bound to cross the sea,
W:to accumulate a fortune great, and build a splendid hall,
W:to decorate and cultivate the land of Donegal. 
W:
W:So she blushed and sighed and then replied, it grieves my heart full sore,
W:To think you are compelled to go and leave the Shamrock shore,
W:Here is my faithful promise that I'll wed with none at all,
W:But I'll stay at home and will not roam away from Donegal. 
W:
W:So he held her in his arms and said, my darling well you know
W:I love you very dearly and loth I am to go,
W:Let us get wed without fear or dread, that puts an end to all,
W:And then I'll have my darling girl, the Star of Donegal. 
W:
W:So she gave consent and off they went to meet with Father Hugh
W:Who joined their hands in wedlock bands and bade them both adieu.
W:From Derry quay they sailed away and bade farewell to all
W:And now they're in Americay, far away from Donegal.

W:I leaned my back against an oak,
W:Thinking it was the strongest tree,
W:But first it bent and then it broke,
W:And that's the way love treated me.
W:
W:For love is handsome and love is fine,
W:The sweetest flower that ever grew, *
W:But love grows old and waxes cold,
W:And fades away like summer dew.
W:
W:When salt sea turns far inland,
W:And mussels grow on every tree,
W:When cockle shells make Christmas bells,
W:Then would I lose my love for thee.
W:
W:* or: And love's a jewel, when first it's new,

W:I am a young fellow that's easy and bold,
W:In Castletown conners I'm very well known.
W:In Newcastle West I spent many a note,

W:But I ne'er will forget the good nature of Jane,

W:My parents had reared me to shake and to sow,

W:Me heart being too airy to drop it so low,
W:I set out on a high speculation.
W:On paper and parchment they taught me to write,
W:In Euclid and grammar they opened my eyes,

W:There is one from Askeaton and one from the Pike,
W:And another from Arda, my heart has beguiled,

W:And she'll milk without spancil or halter.

W:And if anyone laughs we'll have wigs on the green,
W:And the feeble old hag will get supple and free,
W:Agus f\'agaim\'id si\'ud mar at\'a s\'e.

W:With a cock in my hat and my pipes in full tune,
W:I am welcome at once and brought up to a room
W:Where Bacchus is sporting with Venus.
W:There's Peggy and Jane from the town of Bruree,

W:
W:There's some say I'm foolish and more say I'm wise,
W:But being fond of the women I think is no crime,
W:Sure the son of King David had ten hundred wives,
W:And his wisdom was highly regarded.
W:I'll till a good garden and live at my ease,
W:And each woman and child could partake of the same,
W:If there's war in the cabin, themselves they could blame,
W:Agus f\'agaim\'id si\'ud mar at\'a s\'e.
W:
W:But now for the future I think I'll get wise,
W:And I'll marry all those women who acted so kind,
W:Aye I'll marry them all on the morrow by and by,
W:If the clergy agreed to the bargain.
W:And when I'm on my back and my soul be at peace, *
W:all those children and wives they could keen at my wake,
W:And they all gather round and they offer their prayers,

W:It was pleasant and delightful on a bright summer's morn,
W:When the fields and the meadows were covered in corn,

W:Oh, his beauty has entangled me - oh, the same I'll ne'er deny,

W:Here's a health to every labouring boy who ploughs and sows the ground,

W:A gentleman's fair daughter stepped down a narrow lane.

W:He said unto his servant men, "If it were not for the law,
W:I'd have that maid in bed with me and she'd lie next the wall."
W:
W:"Ah, then go away, young man," she said, "and do not bother me.
W:Before you lie one night with me you must answer me questions three.
W:Three questions you must answer me whilst I set forth them all,
W:Ere you and I in one bed lie and I lie next the wall."
W:
W:"You must get me for my breakfast a cherry without a stone,
W:You must get me for my dinner a bird without a bone.
W:For my supper you must get for me a bird without a gall,
W:Ere you and I in one bed lie or I lie next the wall."
W:
W:"Now the cherry when in blossom, it surely has no stone,
W:The chicken when it's in the egg, it surely has no bone.
W:The dove she is a gentle bird and flies without a gall,
W:So you and I in one bed lie and you'll lie next the wall."
W:
W:"Ah, go away, young man," she said, "and do not me perplex.
W:Before you lie one night with me you must answer me questions six.
W:Six questions I'll put forth to you whilst you shall answer all,
W:Ere you and I in one bed lie or I lie next the wall."
W:
W:"Now what is rounder than a ring? What's higher than a tree?
W:And what is worse than women's wrath? What's deeper than the sea?
W:What bird sings best? What tree buds first and on the dew first fall?
W:Ere you and I in one bed lie or I lie next the wall."
W:
W:"Now the world is rounder than a ring, heaven's higher than a tree.
W:The divil is worse than women's wrath, hell's deeper than the sea,

W:So you and I in one bed lie and you'll lie next the wall."

W:As I was a-walking one morning in May,
W:I met a pretty fair maid and unto her did say:
W:"For love I am inclined and I'll tell you my mind,
W:that my inclination lies in your cuckoo's nest."
W:
W:"My darling", says she, "I am innocent and young,
W:and I scarcely can believe your false deluding tongue.
W:Yet to see it in your eyes and it fills me with surprise
W:that your inclination lies in my cuckoo's nest."
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Some like a girl who is pretty in the face,
W:and some like a girl who is slender in the waist.
W:But give me a girl that will wriggle and will twist.
W:At the bottom of the belly lies the cuckoo's nest.
W:
W:"Then my darling", says he, "If you see it in my eyes,
W:then think of it as fondness and do not be surprised.
W:For I love you my dear and I'll marry you I swear
W:If you let me clap my hand on your cuckoo's nest."
W:
W:"My darling", says she, "I can do no such thing,
W:for mother often told me it was committing sin,
W:my maidenhead to lose and my sense to be abused,
W:so have no more to do with my cuckoo's nest!"
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:"My darling", says he, "It is not committing sin,
W:but common sense should tell you it is a pleasing thing.
W:For you were brought into this world to increase and do your best,
W:and to help a man to heaven in your cuckoo's nest."
W:
W:"Well, my darling", says she, "I cannot you deny,
W:for you surely won me heart by the roving of your eye,
W:yet to see it in your eyes that your courage is surprised
W:so gently lift your hand in my cuckoo's nest."
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:So this couple they got married and soon they went to bed
W:and now this pretty fair maid has lost her maidenhead.
W:In a small country cottage they increase and do their best,
W:and he often claps his hand on her cuckoo's nest.

W:From the moment that I found it, she would never let me rest
W:From rumpling up the feathers of her cuckoo's nest.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:It was bushy, it was prickled, it was feathered all around
W:It was tucked away so neatly and it wasn't easy found
W:Though she said young man you're blundering, I knew it wasn't true
W:For I left her with the makings of a young cuckoo.

W:I've been a wild rover for many a long year
W:And I spent half my money drinking strong ale and beer,
W:Ah, but now for the future I will take better care,
W:In case that misfortune may come to my share.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Wild roving I'll give over, wild roving I'll give o'er,
W:And I never shall be called a wild rover no more.
W:
W:I went into the alehouse where I used to resort
W:And I told the landlady that my money was short,
W:But when she heard my story these words she did say,
W:I can get many customers like you any day.
W:
W:Chorus
W:        
W:I put my hand in my pocket some money to find,
W:And I pulled out the full of my two hands five times,
W:When she saw I had money and money galore,
W:When she saw I had money she called me her st\'or,
W:And she said, I have liquor, and that of the best,
W:These words I have spoken were only in jest.
W:
W:Chorus
W:        
W:If I had all the money that I left in your care,
W:It would till all my land and my family rear,
W:It would thatch all my houses and build me a barn,
W:It would buy me a coat for to keep my back warm.
