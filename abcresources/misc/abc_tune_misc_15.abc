W: Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
W: That saved a wretch; like me!
W: I once was lost, but now am found,
W: Was blind, but now I see.
W: 
W: ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
W: And grace my fears relieved;
W: How precious did that grace appear
W: The hour I first believed!
W: 
W: The Lord hath promised good to me,
W: His word my hope secures;
W: He will my shield and portion be
W: As long as life endures.
W: 
W: When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
W: Bright shining as the sun,
W: We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
W: Than when we first begun.

W: I've travelled far 'neath the northern star,
W: Since the day I said goodbye,
W: And seen many maids in the golden glades
W: Beneath a tropic sky,
W: There's a vision in my reverie,
W: I always will adore,
W: That grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.
W: 
W: 
W: But soon I will return again
W: To the scenes I loved so well,
W: Where many an Irish lad and lass
W: Their tales of love do tell;
W: The silvery dunes and blue lagoons,
W: Along the Rosses' shore
W: And that grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.

W: In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn’t a shilling.
W: His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
W: Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
W: Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
W: There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea.
W: Nolans and Dolans and all the O’Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
W: While songs went round as plenty as water,
W: The harps that are sounded through Tara’s old hall,
W: Biddie Grey and the rat catcher’s daughter singing away at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
W: Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
W: Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
W: How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
W: I spent six months in Brook’s Academy learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
W: Dancing around in their couples and groups.
W: An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
W: He put his boot through Miss Finnerty’s hoops.
W: She fell down in a faint and cried, ‘Holy murder!’
W: Called her brothers and gathered them all.
W: Carmody swore he’d go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Boys oh boys ’tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
W: I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
W: Moloney the piper was near gettin’ smothered.
W: They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
W: Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan’s ball.

W: There's a fairmer up in Cairnie, that's kent frae far an' wide
W: Tae be the great Drumdelgie by yonder Deveronside.
W: Noo, the fairmer o' you muckle toon, he is baith hard an' sair,
W: An' the cauldest day that ever blaws, his servants get their share.
W: 
W: At five o'clock we quickly rise and hurry doon the stair;
W: It's there tae corn oor horses, likewise tae straik their hair.
W: Syne, after workin' half an hour, each tae the kitchen goes;
W: It's there to get oor breakfast, which is generally brose.
W: 
W: Noo we hadna gotten oor brose weel supped, an' gi'en oor pints a tie,
W: When the foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, the hour is drawin' nigh!”
W: At six o'clock the mill's put on, tae gi'e us a' strait wark;
W: It tak's four o' us tae mak' her, till ye could wring oor sark.
W: 
W: But when daylicht begins tae peep, and the sky begins tae clear,
W: The foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, ye'll bide nae langer here,
W: It's six o' you will gae tae the ploo, twa will ca' the neeps,
W: And the owsen they'll be after ye when they get on their feet!”
W: 
W: But lang ere we were gannin' forth and turnin' oot tae yoke,
W: The snaw cam' on sae thick and fast that we were like tae choke.
W: The frost it bein' so very bad, the ploo she widna go;
W: Aye, and so our cairtin days commenced among the frost an' snaw.
W: 
W: Oor horses bein' sae young and sma', the shafts they widna fill,
W: And they oft required the saddler tae help ‘em up the hill.
W: But we will sing oor horses' praise, tho' they be young and sma',
W: For they far outshine the Broadlands anes that gang sae full an' braw.
W: 
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, for I maun gang awa'.
W: Oh, fare the weel, Drumdelgie, your weepie' weather an' a'.
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, an' I bid ye a' adieu,
W: An' I leave ye as I got ye, a maist unceevil crew.

W: Down Cherry Street forlorn
W: There Martin Churchill took me in
W: And sent me 'round Cape Horn

W: The Esk was swollen so red and so deep
W: But shoulder to shoulder the brave lads keep;
W: Two thousand swam over to fell English ground

W: Dumfounded they heard the blow, the blow
W: Dumfounded they all ran away, away

W: O see the fleet-foot host of men, who march with faces drawn,
W: From farmstead and from fishers' cot, along the banks of Ban;
W: They come with vengeance in their eyes. Too late! Too late are
W: they,
W: For young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: Oh Ireland, Mother Ireland, you love them still the best
W: The fearless brave who fighting fall upon your hapless breast,
W: But never a one of all your dead more bravely fell in fray,
W: Than he who marches to his fate on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Up the narrow street he stepped, so smiling, proud and young.
W: About the hemp-rope on his neck, the golden ringlets clung;
W: There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, fearless and brave are
W: they,
W: As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: When last this narrow street he trod, his shining pike in hand
W: Behind him marched, in grim array, a earnest stalwart band.
W: To Antrim town! To Antrim town, he led them to the fray,
W: But young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: The grey coat and its sash of green were brave and stainless then,
W: A banner flashed beneath the sun over the marching men;
W: The coat hath many a rent this noon, the sash is torn away,
W: And Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Oh, how his pike flashed in the sun! Then found a foeman's heart,
W: Through furious fight, and heavy odds he bore a true man's part
W: And many a red-coat bit the dust before his keen pike-play,
W: But Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: There's never a one of all your dead more bravely died in fray
W: Than he who marches to his fate in Toomebridge town today;
W: True to the last! True to the last, he treads the upwards way,
W: And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.

W: The morn was breaking bright and fair,
W: The lark sang in the sky,
W: When the maid she bound her goIden hair,
W: With a blythe glance in her eye;
W: For, who beyond the gay green-wood,
W: Was a-waiting her with joy,
W: Oh, who but her gallant Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: Up on the mountains high.
W: 
W: Full often in the dawning hour,
W: Full oft in twilight brown
W: He met the maid in the woodland bower,
W: Where the stream comes foaming down
W: For they were faithful in a love
W: No wars could e'er destroy.
W: No tyrant's law touched Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: "Dear love", she said, "l am so afraid,
W: For the foeman's force and you
W: They've tracked you in the lowland plain
W: And all the valley through.
W: My kinsmen frown when you are named
W: Your life they would destroy
W: 'Beware,' they say, 'of Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy' "
W: 
W: "Fear not, fear not, sweetheart," he cried,
W: "Fear not the foe for me
W: No chain shall fall, whate'er betide,
W: On the arm that would be free!
W: Oh, leave your cruel kin and come,
W: When the lark is in the sky.
W: And it's with my gun I'll guard you,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy."
W: 
W: The morn has come, she rose and fled
W: From her cruel kin and home;
W: And bright the wood, and rosy red,
W: And the tumbling torrent's foam.
W: But the mist came down and the tempest roared,
W: And did all around destroy;
W: And a pale, drowned bride met Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.

W: On Raglan Road of an autumn day
W: I saw her first and knew
W: That her dark hair would weave a snare
W: That I might one day rue
W: I saw the danger and I passed
W: Along the enchanted way
W: And I said let grief be a fallen leaf
W: At the dawning of the day
W: 
W: On Grafton Street in November
W: We tripped lightly along the ledge
W: Of a deep ravine where can be seen
W: The worth of passion's pledge
W: The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
W: And I'm not making hay
W: Oh I love too much and by such by such
W: Is happiness thrown away
W: 
W: I gave her gifts of the mind
W: I gave her the secret signs
W: That known to the artists who have known
W: The true gods of sound and stone
W: And word and tint to without stint
W: I gave her poems to say
W: With her own name there
W: And her own dark hair
W: Like clouds over fields of May
W: 
W: On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
W: I see her walking now
W: Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
W: That I had loved not as I should
W: A creature made of clay
W: When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
W: His wings at the dawn of day

W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

W: When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
W: Me money alas I spent too fast, got drunk as drunk could be
W: And when my money was all gone 'twas then I wanted more
W: But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: I spent the night with Angeline
W: Too drunk to roll in bed
W: My watch was new and my money too
W: In the mornin' with 'em she fled
W: And as I roamed the streets about
W: The whores they all would roar
W: Here comes Jack Rack, the young sailin' lad
W: He must go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: As I was walkin' down the street
W: I met with Rapper Brown
W: I asked for him to take me in
W: And he looked at me with a frown
W: He said "Last time you was paid off
W: With me you jobbed no score
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance
W: And I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance and I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: I hired me aboard of a whaling ship
W: Bound for the Artic seas
W: Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
W: And Jamaican rum would freeze
W: And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear
W: For I'd lost all my money ashore
W: 'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
W: So I'd gone to sea no more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more.
W: 
W: Some days we're catching whales me lads
W: And some days we're catching none
W: With a twenty foot oar cocked in our hands
W: From four o'clock in the morn
W: And when the shades of night come in
W: We rest on our weary oar
W: 'Twas then I wished that I was dead
W: Or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then I wished that I was dead or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: Come all you bold seafarin' men
W: And listen to my song
W: If you come off of them long trips
W: I'd have ya's not go wrong
W: Take my advice, drink no strong drink
W: Don't go sleeping with no whores
W: Get married instead and spend all night in bed
W: So you'll go to sea no more
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

W: 
W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
W: The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
W: Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
W: And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
W: There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
W: We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
W: And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
W: That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
W: She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
W: But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
W: Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
W: But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
W: For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
W: And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
W: Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
W: Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
W: Or I'd never have the strength to go below
W: But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
W: Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
W: Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
W: She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
W: And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
W: They won't be laughing in another day
W: And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
W: With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
W: Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
W: And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

W: In the Year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Six
W: We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
W: We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
W: For the grand City Hall in New York
W: She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
W: And lord how the trade winds drove her
W: She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
W: And they called her the Irish Rover
W: 
W: There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
W: There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W: There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
W: And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
W: And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W: And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
W: Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W: We had two million barrels of bone
W: We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
W: We had four million barrels of stone
W: We had five million hogs and six million dogs
W: And seven million barrels of porter
W: We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
W: In the hold of the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
W: And our ship lost her way in the fog
W: And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
W: 'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
W: Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
W: We nearly tumbled over
W: Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
W: Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

W: Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet;
W: She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet.
W: She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;
W: But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.
W: 
W: In a field by the river my love and I did stand,
W: And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.
W: She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs;
W: But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.

W: In a grand ol city of London
W: Apprentice to a trade I was bound
W: And many's an hour's sweet happiness
W: Have I spent in this neat little town.
W: A sad misfortune came over me
W: Which caused me to stray from the land
W: Far away from my friends and relations
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.
W: 
W: {Chorus}
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: I took a stroll down Broadway
W: Meaning not long for to stay
W: When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
W: Came a traipsing along the highway
W: She was both fair and handsome
W: Her neck it was just like a swans'
W: And her hair is hung over her shoulder
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
W: And the gentleman passing us by
W: Well I knew she meant the doing of him
W: By the look in her roguish black eye
W: A gold watch she took from his pocket
W: And placed it right into my hand
W: And the very first thing I said was
W: Bad 'cess to the black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: Before the judge and the jury
W: Next morning I had to appear
W: And the judge he said to me 'Young man
W: Your case is proven clear'
W: We'll give you seven years penal servitude
W: To be spent far away from the land
W: Far away from your friends and companions
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.

W: 
W: It's adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu,
W: I am going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.
W: Come change your ring with me, dear girl,
W: Come change your ring with me,
W: For it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.
W: 
W: And when I'm far upon the sea you'll know not where I am.
W: Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.
W: The secrets of your heart, dear girl,
W: Are the best of my good will,
W: So let my body be where it might, my heart will be with you still.
W: 
W: There's tinkers, tailors, shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing through the deep.
W: There's nothing to protect us, love,
W: Or keep us from the cold,
W: On the ocean wide, where we must fight like jolly seamen bold.
W: 
W: There's a heavy storm arising, see how it gathers round,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.
W: Our officers commanded us,
W: And them we must obey,
W: Expecting every moment for to get cast away.
W: 
W: But when the war is over, there'll be peace on every shore,
W: We'll return to our wives and out families, and the girls that we adore.
W: We'll drink out liquor merrily,
W: And spend out money free,
W: And when the money is all gone -- we'll boldly go to sea.

W: When I was in service in Rosemary Lane
W: I won the good favor of master and dame
W: Until a sailor came by one night for to call
W: And that was the beginning of my downfall
W: 
W: He called for a candle to light him to bed
W: And likewise a silk hankerchief to tie up his hair
W: To tie up his hair as sailors will do,
W: "And third my pretty Polly, will you come too?"
W: 
W: Now this may seem young and foolish, she thought it no harm
W: To lie on the bed to keep herself warm
W: And what was done there, I shall never disclose
W: But I wish that short night had been seven long years
W: 
W: So early next morning this sailor arose
W: And into my pockets 3 guineas did throw
W: Saying"This I will give and more I will do
W: If you'll be my Polly wherever I go"
W: 
W: Now if it's a boy, he'll fight for the King
W: And if it's a girl she'll wear a gold ring

W: I wish I was in Lancashire
W: A' huntin' o' the hare,

W: I wish I was in Lancashire
W: Along the folks I know,

W: 
W: VERSE DEREK
W: Now rainfall in Cobargo, would spoil a bloody good drought.
W: And deregulated dairying, leaves me with no doubt.
W: Feeding stock every day, shooting kangaroos.
W: No wonder we sing of Lancashire to beat the rural blues.

W: Pictures of uncommon nature, painted by a masters hand
W: Draw me ever on life's journey, rendered thus to understand
W: 
W: As a songbird that is fallen, only to regain the sky
W: From this frozen shadow valley, they must weary fly
W: 
W: Love is from no distance calling, faithful as the rising sun
W: Warms the bitter heart and heartache, till the east of Eden's gone
W: Clouds of fear and misconception, wax and wane as if the moon
W: So is in a sense forsaken, till the will of God be known

W: There were three auld gypsies came to our hall door.
W: They came brave and boldly-o.
W: And one sang high and the other sang low
W: And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o.
W: 
W: It was upstairs, downstairs the lady went,
W: Put on her suit of leather-o,
W: And it was the cry all around her door;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: It was late that night when the lord came in,
W: Enquiring for his lady-o,
W: And the servant girl’s reply to him was;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Then saddle for me my milk-white steed
W: Me big horse is not speedy-o
W: And I will ride and I’ll seek me bride,
W: She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: He rode east and he rode west
W: He rode north and south also,
W: And when he rode to the wide open field
W: It was there that he spied his lady-o.
W: 
W: “Arra, why did you leave your house and your land,
W: Why did you leave your money-o?
W: Why did you leave your only wedded lord
W: All for the raggle taggle gypsy-o?”
W: 
W: “Yerra what do I care for me house and me land?
W: What do I care for money-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “It was there last night you’d a goose feather bed,
W: Blankets drawn so comely-o.
W: But tonight you lie in a wide open field
W: In the arms of the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Yerra, what do I care for me goose feather bed?
W: Yerra, what do I care for blankets-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Oh, for you rode east when I rode west,
W: You rode high and I rode low.
W: I’d rather have a kiss of the yellow gypsy’s lips
W: Than all the cash and money-o”

W: A gypsy came to the castle gate,
W: He sang so sweet and wild.
W: And with his song he stole away,
W: The master’s only child.
W: 
W: Oh she cast away her silken gown,
W: She cast away her pride;
W: And ran with him into the night,
W: Down to the sea so wild.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: Sit once more by a round fireside,
W: With your head upon my knee!
W: 
W: Oh I’d rather live an hour here,
W: Than seven long years with thee.
W: And feel the salt spray on my cheek,
W: And know that I am free.
W: 
W: Oh she danced in the wind and she danced in the rain,
W: on the edge of the cliffs and the shore!
W: And she tasted the salt upon her cheek,
W: And never came home no more!
W: 
W: Till ... a babe was born on a summers morn,
W: He was his parents joy.
W: His mother held him to her heart,
W: Her precious gypsy boy.
W: 
W: She took him to her fathers house,
W: She beat upon the gate.
W: Crying, ‘come and see my darling babe,
W: We named him for your sake’.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: And the father of that darlin' babe
W: Shall be a son to me.
W: 
W: They danced all the day and they danced all the night.
W: And they danced on the cliffs and the shore.
W: And the master held his grandchild tight,
W: And ne’er was alone no more.

W: My young love said to me,
W: "My mother won't mind,
W: And my father won't slight you,

W: And she laid her hand on me,
W: and this she did say,
W: "Oh, it will not be long, love,
W: till our wedding-day"
W:

W: With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever
W: And if I were with my love, I would live forever

W: A holiday, a holiday
W: And the first one of the year
W: Lord Donald's wife came into the church
W: The gospel for to hear
W: 
W: And when the meeting it was done
W: She cast her eyes about
W: And there she saw little Matty Groves
W: Walking in the crowd
W: 
W: "Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: Come home with me tonight
W: Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: And sleep with me 'til light"
W: "Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home
W: And sleep with you tonight
W: By the rings on your fingers I can tell
W: You are Lord Donald's wife"
W: 
W: "What if I am Lord Donald's wife?
W: Lord Donald's not at home
W: He is out in the far cornfields
W: Bringing the yearlings home"
W: 
W: And a servant who was standing by
W: And hearing what was said
W: He swore Lord Donald he would know
W: Before the sun would set
W: 
W: And in his hurry to carry the news
W: He bent his breast and ran
W: And when he came to the broad millstream
W: He took off his shoes and swam
W: 
W: Little Matty Groves, he lay down
W: And took a little sleep
W: When he awoke, Lord Donald
W: Was standing at his feet
W: 
W: Saying "How do you like my feather bed
W: And how do you like my sheets?
W: How do you like my lady
W: Who lies in your arms asleep?"
W: 
W: "Oh, well I like your feather bed
W: And well I like your sheets
W: But better I like your lady gay
W: Who lies in my arms asleep"
W: 
W: "Well, get up, get up," Lord Donald cried
W: "Get up as quick as you can
W: It'll never be said in fair England
W: I slew a naked man"
W: 
W: "Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up
W: I can't get up for my life
W: For you have two long beaten swords
W: And I not a pocket knife"
W: 
W: "Well it's true I have two beaten swords
W: And they cost me deep in the purse
W: But you will have the better of them
W: And I will have the worse
W: 
W: And you will strike the very first blow
W: And strike it like a man
W: I will strike the very next blow
W: And I'll kill you if I can"
W: 
W: So Matty struck the very first blow
W: And he hurt Lord Donald sore
W: Lord Donald struck the very next blow
W: And Matty struck no more
W: 
W: And then Lord Donald he took his wife
W: And he sat her on his knee
W: Saying "Who do you like the best of us
W: Matty Groves or me?"
W: 
W: And then up spoke his own dear wife
W: Never heard to speak so free
W: "I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips
W: Than you or your finery".
W: 
W: Lord Donald he jumped up
W: And loudly he did bawl
W: He struck his wife right through the heart
W: And pinned her against the wall
W: 
W: "A grave, a grave," Lord Donald cried
W: "To put these lovers in
W: But bury my lady at the top
W: For she was of noble kin”

W: [Verse 1]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young girl calling
W: Michael they are taking you away
W: For you stole Trevelyans corn
W: So the young might see the morn
W: Now a prison ship lay waiting in the bay
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young man calling
W: Nothing matters Mary when you're free
W: Against the famine and the crown
W: I rebelled they cut me down
W: Now you must raise our child with dignity
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: By a lonely harbour wall
W: She watched the last star falling
W: As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
W: For she lives to hope and pray
W: For her love in Botany bay
W: It's so lonely around the fields of Athenry

W: By chance it was I met my love
W: It did me much surprise
W: Down by a shady myrtle grove
W: Just as the sun did rise
W: The birds they sang right gloriously
W: And pleasant was the air
W: And there was none save she and I
W: Among the flowers fair
W: 
W: In dewy grass and green we walked
W: She timid was and coy
W: How can'st thou choose but pity me
W: My pretty pearl, my joy
W: How comes it that thou stroll this way?
W: Sweet maiden tell me true
W: Before bright Phoebus' glittering ray
W: Has supped the morning dew?
W: 
W: I go to tend the flocks I love
W: The ewes and tender lambs
W: That pasture by the myrtle grove
W: That gambol by their dams
W: There I enjoy a pure content
W: At dawning of the day
W: Then, hand in hand, we lovers went
W: To see the flock at play
W: 
W: And as we wended down the road
W: I said to her, "Sweet maid
W: Three years I in my place abode
W: And three more must be stayed
W: The three that I am bound so fast
W: O fairest wait for me
W: And when the weary years are past
W: Then wedded we will be."
W: 
W: "Three years are long, three times too long
W: Too lengthy the delay"
W: And then I answered in my song
W: "Hope wastes them quick away
W: Where love is fervent, fain and fast
W: And knoweth not decay
W: There nimbly fleet the seasons past
W: Accounted as one day."

W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
W: There are frail forms fainting at the door:
W: Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say –
W: Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W: 
W: Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
W: While we all sup sorrow with the poor:
W: There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
W: With a worn heart whose better days are o’er:
W: Though her voice would be merry, ’tis sighing all the day –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days have lingered around my cab in door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
W: ‘ Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore,
W: ‘ Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave, –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: ​Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

W: Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
W: Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
W: Soar Black Head against the sky
W: Between the rocks that run down to the sea
W: 
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
W: Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
W: 
W: Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
W: Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
W: 
W: Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
W: Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: 
W: Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
W: Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
W: Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: 
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

W: 'Neath the willow tree

W: Sunshine came along with thee

W: Sparkling, seemed to break
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and life return with thee
W: And swallows in the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair

W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Aura Lea! The bird may flee
W: The willow's golden hair
W: Swing through winter fitfully
W: On the stormy air
W: Yet if thy blue eyes I see
W: Gloom will soon depart
W: For to me, sweet Aura Lea
W: Is sunshine through the heart
W: 
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!

W: When the mistletoe was green
W: Midst the winter's snows
W: Sunshine in thy face was seen
W: Kissing lips of rose
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and light return with thee
W: And swallows with the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair

W: As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
W: How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
W: Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
W: I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here
W: 
W: I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
W: Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold

W: You are the one that I will adore until my dying day
W:

W: If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
W: Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
W: If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
W: 
W: And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
W: And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
W: And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
W: That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee

W: Oh once upon a time in Arkansas
W: An old man sat in his little cabin door
W: And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
W: A jolly old tune that he played by ear
W: 
W: It was raining hard but the fiddler didn’t care
W: He sawed away at the popular air
W: Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
W: That didn’t seem to bother the old man at all
W: 
W: A traveler was riding by that day
W: And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
W: The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
W: But the old man still didn’t seem to fret
W: 
W: So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
W: You’d better mend your roof said he
W: But the old man said as he played away
W: I couldn’t mend it now it’s a rainy day
W: 
W: The traveler replied that’s all quite true
W: But this I think is the thing for you to do
W: Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
W: Then patch the old roof till it’s good and tight
W: 
W: But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
W: And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
W: Get along said he for you give me a pain
W: My cabin never leaks when it doesn’t rain

W: For a kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The cobbler he rose and he soon let her in, his arm
W: And his hammer were neat as a pin
W: And he had the will for the greet her son slim
W: With a kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Oh cobbler oh cobbler tis soon we’ll be wed
W: And nestling together in a fine feather bed
W: So give me too shoes with buckles of red
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The maid hid the shoes in the back of her waist,
W: She praised his good cobbling and shoemakers taste
W: And home to her father, she mournfully faced
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O father oh father I have got me a man
W: And he is the one I would web if I can
W: As handsome as ever in leather did stand
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Her father was thinking and thinking again
W: For to wed her to riches and have them for him
W: Who knows but it might be a prince or a king,
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: Who knows that it might be a jobber from town,
W: Or a wealthy sea captain who sails the world round?
W: A man with some thousands and thousands of pounds
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: So the father was smiling the daughter embraced,
W: And touching the buckles he drew back in haste
W: He spied the red shoes that were tied round her waist
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O daughter o daughter he started to shout,
W: When he did discover what she was about
W: God knows it was one but that old cobbling clout.
W: That she met in the morning early

T: My Old Kentucky Home
C:Stephen Foster
B: songs
B: traditional songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: "My Old Kentucky Home," originally titled "Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night!," is the state song of Kentucky.
W: 
W: The facts surrounding the composition of this song point to the influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin rather than a visit to Kentucky. Foster may or may not have visited his cousins in Bardstown, Kentucky at their mansion Federal Hill, but the original sketch of this song, dating from 1852, substitutes "Poor Uncle Tom" for "My Old Kentucky Home" and aligns Foster's sympathies with the Abolitionist movement.
W: =========================
W: 
W: Verse 1:
W: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
W: ‘Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
W: The corn-top’s ripe and the meadow’s in the bloom,
W: While the birds make music all the day.
W: The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
W: All merry, all happy and bright;
W: By ‘n’ by Hard Times comes a-knocking at the door,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Weep no more my lady
W: Oh! weep no more today!
W: We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,
W: For the Old Kentucky Home far away.
W: 
W: Verse 2:
W: They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
W: On meadow, the hill and the shore,
W: They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
W: On the bench by the old cabin door.
W: The day goes by like a shadow o’er the heart,
W: With sorrow, where all was delight,
W: The time has come when the darkies have to part,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3:
W: The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
W: Wherever the darky may go;
W: A few more days, and the trouble all will end,
W: In the field where the sugar-canes grow;
W: A few more days for to tote the weary load,
W: No matter, ’twill never be light;
W: A few more days till we totter on the road,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W:

W: With dreams running through her head
W: "I'll lay on me life," said the gay old wife
W: There's a boy in me daughter's bed"
W: 
W: Then up the stairs the old man crept
W: And into the room did steal
W: Silence reigned where the daughter slept
W: And he never twigged the creel
W: 
W: "My curse attend you, father
W: What brought you up so soon?
W: To put me through my evening prayers
W: And I just lying down?"
W: 
W: He went back to his gay old wife
W: He went back to she
W: "She has the prayer book in her hand
W: And she's praying for you and me"
W: 
W: No peace nor ease could that old wife get
W: 'Til she would rise and see
W: She came on a stumbling-block
W: And into the creel went she
W: 
W: "Oh high I rocked her, oh I rocked her
W: Didn't I rock her well?
W: For if any old wife begrudge me her daughter
W: I'll rock her into hell"

W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning

W: "[G]Come ride with me my red-haired maiden, the d[C]onkey he will carry two,"
W: [G]She looked at me with eyes atwinkle, her c[C]heeks a lovely [D]rosy h[G]ue.
W: [G]"Thank you kindly, sir," she answered, th[C]en she tossed her bright red hair,
W: [G]"Seeing as you have the donkey I'll rid[C]e with you to the [D]Dingle Fair[G]."
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in the m[D]arriage [G]bed.
W: 
W: [G]When we reached the town of Dingle, I [C]took her hand to say goodbye,
W: [G]A traveller he stepped up behind me and [C]hit me right in [D]my left e[G]ye.
W: [G]Now I was feeling kind of peevish, [C]my poor eye felt sad and sore
W: [G]I tapped him gently with my hobnails, and he [C]flew back through M[D]urphy's doo[G]r.
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in the m[D]arriage [G]bed.
W: 
W: [G]He galloped off to find his father, the t[C]allest man I e'er did meet
W: [G]He tapped me gently with his knuckles, n[C]ow I am minus t[D]wo front te[G]eth.
W: [G]Round the corner came a peeler, to[C]ld me that I'd broke the law
W: [G]The donkey kicked him in the kneecap, [C]he fell down and b[D]roke his ja[G]w.
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in the m[D]arriage [G]bed.
W: 
W: [G]Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling, "I'll [C]come along with you" she said
W: [G]"We'll forget the priest this very morning, and tonig[C]ht we'll sleep in [D]Murphy's sh[G]ed
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are off to bed
W: For[G]get the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in Mur[D]phy's sh[G]ed.

W: I got me a ring and a parson too
W: Got me a scratch in a married quarter
W: Settled me down to a peaceful life
W: Happy as a king with Reilly's daughter.
W: 
W: Suddenly a footstep on the stairs
W: Who should it be but Reilly out for slaughter
W: With two pistols in his hands
W: Looking for the man who had married his daughter.
W: 
W: I caught old Reilly by the hair
W: Rammed his head in a pail of water
W: Fired his pistols into the air
W: A damned sight quicker than I married his daughter

W: We gathered our dogs and we circled around
W: For none loves the sport better than the boys in the dell.
W: 
W: And when we arrived they were all standing there

W: We didn't get far till someone gave the cheer
W: Over high hills and valleys the sweet puss did steer
W: 
W: As we flew o'er the hills, 'twas a beautiful sight
W: There was dogs black and yellow, there was dogs black and white
W: As she took the black bank for to try them once more
W: Oh it was her last look o'er the hills of Greenmore.
W: 
W: In a field of wheat stubble this pussy did lie
W: And Rory and Charmer they did pass her by
W: And there where we stood at the top of the brae
W: We heard the last words that this sweet puss did say:
W: 
W: No more o'er the green fields of Keady I'll roam
W: Nor trip through the fields, boys, in sport and in fun
W: Or hear the long horn that your toner does play
W: I'll go home to my den by the clear light of day.
W: 
W: You may blame ol' MacMahon for killing the hare
W: For he's at his ol' capers this many's a year
W: On Saturday and Sunday he never gives o'er

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I courted a wee girl for many's the long day
W: And I slighted all others that came in my way
W: But now she's rewarded me to the last day
W: She's gone to be wed to another.
W: 
W: The bride and bride's party to church they did go
W: The bride she rode foremost she put the best show
W: And I followed after with a heart full of woe
W: To see my love wed to another.
W: 
W: The bride and bride's party in church they did stand
W: Gold rings on their fingers, a love by the hand
W: The man that she's wed to he has houses and land
W: He may have her since I couldn't gain her.
W: 
W: The next time I say her she was seated down neat
W: I sat down beside her not a bite could I eat
W: For I thought my love's company far better than meat
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.
W: 
W: The last time I saw her she was all dressed in white
W: And the more I gazed on her she dazzled my sight
W: I lifted my hat and I bade her goodnight
W: Here's adieu to all false-hearted lovers.
W: 
W: I courted that wee girl for many's the long day
W: And I slighted all others that came in my way
W: But now she's rewarded me to the last day
W: She's gone to be wed to another.
W: 
W: So dig me a grave and dig it down deep
W: And strew it all over with primrose so sweet
W: And lay me down easy for no more to weep
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.

W: I took her for Helen, the Grec-i-an queen

W: But think on me still, but think on me still
W: May she never marry, but think on me still
W: 
W: Oh, me parents dote on me, and it's all for their sake

W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae

W: And may you think on me when that I am far away
W: For there's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae

W: In faith there is a decline(?) under yond forest sky
W: And straightway to my true love I surely will fly

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One Sunday morning as I went walking
W: By Brisbane waters I chanced to stray
W: I heard a prisoner his fate bewailing
W: As on the sunny river bank he lay
W: I am a native from Erin's island
W: Transported now from my native shore
W: They tore me from my aged parents
W: And from the maiden whom I adore
W: 
W: I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
W: At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie
W: At all those settlements I've woked in chains
W: But of all places of condemnation
W: And penal stations of New South Wales
W: Of Moreton Bay I have found no equal
W: Excessive tyranny each day prevails
W: For three long years I was beastly treated
W: And heavy irons on my legs I wore
W: My back from flogging was lacerated
W: And often slain with my crimson gore
W: And many a man from downright starvation
W: Lies mouldering underneath the clay
W: And Captain Logan he had us mangled
W: At the triangles in Moreton Bay
W: 
W: Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
W: We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
W: Till a native black lying there in ambush
W: Did give our tyrant his mortal stroke
W: My fellow prisoners exhilarated
W: That all such monsters a death shall find
W: And when from bondage we're liberated
W: Our former sufferings shall fade from mind
