W:Hoo, ho, soon shall I see them
W:O! He ho see them, O see them
W:O! Ho ro soon shall I see them
W:The mist covered mountains of home
W:
W:There I shall visit the place of my birth
W:And they'll give me a welcome the warmest on earth
W:All so loving and kind and full of music and mirth
W:In the sweet sounding language of home
W:
W:There I shall gaze on the mountains again
W:On the fields and the woods and the burns in the glen
W:And away among the corries beyond human ken
W:In the haunts of the deer I shall roam
