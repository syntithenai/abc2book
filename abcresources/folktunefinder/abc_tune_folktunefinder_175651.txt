% %This is the version played by George Wilson.  Though Benny Thomasson is listed as
% %the copywright holder, I've been told this tune was actually composed by his
% %father, Luke Thomasson.  It's been recorded many times, including versions on
% %"The Hammered Dulcimer" by Fennig's All-Stars (Front Hall Records); by Jay Ungar
% %on "Songs, Ballads & Fiddle Tunes" (Philo); and on "Goin' to Town" by Jim
% %Johnson, 6937 Salem Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45230.
