W: "What did I have" this fine old woman did say,
W: "I had four green field, and each one was a jewel,

W:  They fought and died, and that was my grief" said she.

W: "Long time ago" said the fine old woman,
W: "Long time ago" this fine old woman did say,
W: "There was war and death, plundering and pillage,
W:  My children starved by mountain, valley and sea,
W:  And their wailing cries, they shook the very heavens.
W:  My four green fields ran red with their blood" said  she.
W:
W: What have I now" said the fine old woman,
W: What have I now" this fine old woman did say,
W: "I have four green fields, and one of them's in bondage,
W:  In strangers' hands who came and took it from me.
W:  But my sons have sons as brave as were their fathers.
W:  My four green fields will bloom once again" said she.
