%% "The 'Great Waltz of China' was a forgotten pundit's winning submission to the 1985
%% Ashokan Celtic Week Original Tune Title Competition.  Later that summer, during
%% Northern Week, I sat alone one dawn at the piano in the Ashokan dance hall and wrote
%% a tune to go with the name.  (Attentive listeners will note a judiciously pentatonic
%% melody ensnared midst a decidedly Western harmonic substrate.)  A mystery of music:
%% that one heart's sad and lonely moments may help another's sun rise some day."
%% CD/cassette/tunebook 'All the Time in the World (And a Little Bit More)',
