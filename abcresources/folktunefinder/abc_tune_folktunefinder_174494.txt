Q:450
N:I visited the Isle of Gigha a few summers ago where I met 
N:some fantastic people - and animals. Les, who was in charge 
N:of the water works at the time had an amazing cat called  
N:Martin who joined us on a five-mile walk along the coast 
N:one day. Sometimes all we could see of him was the tip of his 
N:black tail sticking up through the bracken. All we could hear 
N:of him were his meows, which I have put into the tune.
