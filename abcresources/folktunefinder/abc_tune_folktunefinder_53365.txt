N:The Blessings of Silver. Written 
N:for Lou and Mary Quinn's 
N:twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. 
N:Ed loved the connotations of 
N:the title: the blessings of twenty-five 
N:years of marriage, the blessings of a 
N:couple growing old together, and the many rewards 
N:of family life. Ed admired Lou not 
N:only because of his musical talent, but also because he 
N:was a self-made man who set high standards 
N:for other immigrants who followed him to the New World.
