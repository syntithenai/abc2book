W:There were three brothers in merry Scotland
W:In Scotland there lived brothers three
W:And they did cast lots which of them should go, should go, should go
W:For to turn robber all on the salt sea
W:
W:The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
W:The youngest of all the three
W:That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
W:For to maintain his two brothers and he
W:
W:He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
W:And part of a short winter's day
W:When he espied a rich lofty ship
W:Come a bibing down him straight away
W:
W:Hello, hello, cried Henry Martin
W:What makes you sail so high
W:I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London town
W:Won't you please for to let me pass by
W:
W:O no, o no, cried henry martin
W:That thing it never can be
W:For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
W:For to maintain my two brothers and me
W:
W:So lower your topsail and bail up your mizzen
W:Bring yourself under my lee
W:Or I shall give you a fast flowing ball
W:And your dear bodies drown in the salt sea
W:
W:Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
W:For fully two hours or three
W:Til Henry Martin gave to her the death shot
W:Heavily listing to starboard went she
W:
W:The rich merchant vessel was wounded full sore
W:Straight to the bottom went she
W:And Henry Martin sailed away
W:... on the salt sea
W:
W:Sad news, sad news to old England came
W:Sad news to fair London town
W:There was a rich vessel and she's cast away
W:And all of her merry men drowned
