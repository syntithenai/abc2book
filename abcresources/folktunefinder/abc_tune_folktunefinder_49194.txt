M:4/4
%W:Version 1
%W:I am lonesome since I crossed the hill and o'er the moor and valley,
%W:such grievous thoughts my heart doth fill since parting with me Sally
%W:I seek no more the fine nor gay, for each doth but remind me
%W:how swift the hours did pass away with the girl I left behind me.
%W:
%W:Oh ne'er shall I forget the night the stars were bright above me,
%W:and gently lent their sil'vry light when first she vowed to love me.
%W:But now I'm bound for Brighton Camp, kind heaven then pray guide me
%W:and bring me safely home again to the girl I left behind me.

W:Version 2
W:1. The dames of France are fond and free, and Flemish lips are willing;
W:And soft the maids of Italy, and Spanish eyes are thrilling;
W:Still, though I bask beneath their smile, their charms fail to bind me.
W:And my heart goes back to Erin's Isle, to the girl I left behind me.
W:
W:2. For she's as fair as Shannon's side, and purer than its water,
W:But she refused to be my bride though many years I sought her.
W:Yet, since to France I sailed away, her letters oft remind me,
W:That I promised never to gainsay the girl I left behind me.
W:
W:3. She says: "My own dear love come home, my friends are rich and many;
W:Or else, abroad with you I'll roam, a soldier stout as any;
W:If you'll not come, nor let me go, I'll think you have resigned me."
W:My heart nigh broke when I answered "No," to the girl I left behind me.
W:
W:4. For never shall my true love brave a life of war and toiling
W:And never as a skulking slave I'll tread my native soil on.
W:But were it free or to be free, the battle's close would find me
W:To Ireland bound, nor message need from the girl I left behind me.
