W:2. There's a hole in my heart you could easy round a turnip in,
W:   As big as any pavin' stone from Dublin to the Divil's glen.

W:   And not to leave me here all alone for to die.
W:   Dee howdle duddley dootle [etc]

W:A few more verses from Tom Lenihan:
W:3.  Ma'am dear, do you remember as we came home the rain began.
W:    I covered her with my coat, oh, the devil a waistcoat I had on,
W:    My shirt was rather fine-drawn, yet, oh, the base and cruel one!
W:    After all that she has left me here alone for to die.
W:4.  I went and told my tale to Father McDonald, ma'am,
W:    And then I went and asked advice of Counsellor O'Connell, ma'am.
W:    They told me promise-breaches had ever been since the world began: Now
W:    I've only one pair, ma'am, and they are corduroy!
W:5.  What would you do, ma'am, or what would you advise me to do
W:    Must my corduroys to Molly go In truth I'm bothered what I'll do. I
W:    can't afford to lose both my heart and my ould britches too. Sure the
W:    devil a hair I care when I've only to die.
W:6.  I'm as hot and determined as a live salamander, ma'am.
W:    Won't ye all come in my wake when I go on my long me[a]nder, ma'am I
W:    thought I was as famous as the famous Alexander, ma'am, When I hear ye
W:    crying around me: "Arrah, why did you die"
