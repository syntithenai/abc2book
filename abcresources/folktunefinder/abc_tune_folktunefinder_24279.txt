W:In Oxford Town in Halifax fair
W:As I walked out to take the air,
W:I viewed the hills and the valleys 'round,
W:And at length I heard a doleful sound.
W:
W:"My father he is a wealthy man;
W:My mother she is a lady fair,
W:And I their child, the only heir;
W:False lover has brought me to despair."
W:
W:Then through yonder meadow at will she goes,
W:A-picking the flowers just as they grow,
W:First a pink and then a blue
W:Until she has gathered the meadow through.
W:
W:Then out of the flowers she made her a bed,
W:A flowery pillow to ease her head.
W:Then she lay down, and then she Spoke:
W:Saying, "O false lover, my heart is broke.
W:
W:"Go dig my grave both wide and deep;
W:Put a marble stone at my head and feet,
W:And on my breast put a turtle-dove
W:That the world may know I died for love."
W:
W:When Mary's true love this news came to be told,
W:That her fair body was dead and cold,
W:"I'm glad," said he, "she has done so well;
W:I long to hear the tolling bell.
W:
W:"When Mary in Abraham's bosom shall sleep,'
W:So softly, softly she will sleep;
W:When Mary in Abraham's bosom shall sleep,
W:My poor soul in hell it will weep."
