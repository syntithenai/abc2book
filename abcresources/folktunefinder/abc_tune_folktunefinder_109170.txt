W:Who did you say it was brother
W:Who was it fell by the way
W:When whiskey and blood run together
W:Did you hear anyone pray

W:  Chorus:
W:  I didn't hear nobody pray, dear brother
W:  I didn't hear nobody pray
W:  I heard the crash on the highway
W:  But I didn't hear nobody pray.
W:
W:When I heard the crash on the highway
W:I knew what it was from the start
W:I went to the scene of destruction
W:And a picture was stamped on my heart.
W:
W:There was whiskey and blood all together
W:Mixed with glass where they lay
W:Death played her hand in destruction
W:But I didn't hear nobody pray.
W:
W:I wish I could change this sad story
W:That I am now telling you
W:But there is no way I can change it
W:For somebody's life is now through.
W:
W:Their soul has been called by the Master
W:They died in a crash on the way
W:And I heard the groans of the dying
W:But I didn't hear nobody pray.
