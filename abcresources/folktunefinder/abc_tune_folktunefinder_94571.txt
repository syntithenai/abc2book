W:Zuleika was fair to see,
W:A fair Persian maiden was she;
W:She lived in Baghdad
W:Where all men were bad,
W:But nine was so bad as she.
W:
W:Her husband was very old,
W:With millions in silver and gold.
W:He kept her locked in, away from all sin,
W:For Persians are very bold.
W:He kept her locked in, away from all sin,
W:For Persians are very bold.
W:
W:On her head she wore a turban,
W:Which came from the looms of Iran.
W:Where no one could see she kept a small key,
W:Which she threw out again and again.
W:Where no one could see she kept a small key,
W:Which she threw out again and again.
W:
W:The first time she threw the key out,
W:It fell by the old water spout.
W:She sighed and she cried as the door opened wide
W:And in walked her lover, Mahout.
W:She sighed and she cried as the door opened wide
W:And in walked her lover, Mahout.
W:
W:The next time she threw out the key,
W:It fell by the old banyan tree.
W:She sighed and she cried as the door opened wide
W:And in walked her lover, Ali.
W:She sighed and she cried as the door opened wide
W:And in walked her lover, Ali.
W:
W:She threw out the key once again,
W:Expecting her love, Suleiman.
W:She sighed and she cried and she virtually died
W:As in walked a whole caravan.
W:She sighed and she cried and she virtually died
W:As in walked a whole caravan.
W:
W:The leader then bowed his head low,
W:And waited her wishes to know.
W:"The most of you stay," Zuleika did say,
W:"But the children and camels must go. "
