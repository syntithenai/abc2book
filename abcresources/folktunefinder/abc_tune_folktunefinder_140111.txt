N:Written for Lou and Mary Quinn's
N:twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Ed loved the connotations of
N:the title: the blessings of twenty-five years of marriage, the
N:blessings of a couple growing old together, and the many rewards
N:of family life. Ed admired Lou not only because of his musical
N:talent, but also because he was a self-made man who set high standards
