% Well, how do you do, Private William McBride,
% Do you mind if I sit down here by your graveside
% And rest for awhile in the warm summer sun,
% I've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done.
% And I see by your gravestone you were only 19
% When you joined the glorious fallen in 1916,
% Well, I hope you died quick and I hope you died clean
% Or, Willie McBride, was it slow and obscene
%
% chorus
% Did they Beat the drum slowly, did the play the pipes lowly
% Did the rifles fir o'er you as they lowered you down
% Did the bugles sound The Last Post in chorus
% Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest
%
% And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind
% In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined
% And, though you died back in 1916,
% To that loyal heart are you always 19
% Or are you a stranger without even a name,
% Forever enshrined behind some glass pane,
% In an old photograph, torn and tattered and stained,
% And fading to yellow in a brown leather frame
%
%  The sun's shining down on these green fields of France;
% The warm wind blows gently, and the red poppies dance.
% The trenches have vanished long under the plow;
% No gas and no barbed wire, no guns firing now.
% But here in this graveyard that's still No Man's Land
% The countless white crosses in mute witness stand
% To man's blind indifference to his fellow man.
% And a whole generation who were butchered and damned.
%
% And I can't help but wonder, no Willie McBride,
% Do all those who lie here know why they died
% Did you really believe them when they told you "The Cause"
% Did you really believe that this war would end wars
% Well the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame
% The killing, the dying, it was all done in vain,
% For Willie McBride, it all happened again,
% And again, and again, and again, and again.
