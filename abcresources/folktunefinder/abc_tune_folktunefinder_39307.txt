W:The lady sits at her own front door
W:As straight as a willow wand
W:And by there come a lusty smith
W:With his hammer in his hand
W:
W:  Crying bide lady bide
W:  For there's a nowhere you can hide
W:  For the lusty smith will be your love
W:  And he will lay your pride.
W:
W:Why do you sit there lady fair
W:All in your robes of red
W:I'll come tomorrow at this same time
W:And have you in me bed
W:
W:  Crying . . .
W:
W:Away away you coal black smith
W:Would you do me this wrong
W:For to think to have me maiden head
W:That I have kept so long
W:
W:I'd rather I was dead and cold
W:And me body laid in the grave
W:Than a lusty, dusty, coal black smith
W:Me maiden head should have
W:
W:  Crying . . .
W:
W:So the lady, she curled up her hand
W:And swore upon the mold
W:That he'd not have her maiden head
W:For all of a pot of gold.
W:
W:But the blacksmith he curled up his hand
W:And he swore upon the mast
W:That he would have her maiden head
W:For the half of that or less
W:
W:  Crying . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a dove
W:And flew up into the air
W:Ah, but he became an old cock pigeon
W:And they flew pair and pair
W:
W:  Cooing . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a mare
W:As dark as the night was black
W:Ah, but he became a golden saddle
W:And he clumb upon to her back
W:
W:  Itching . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a hare
W:And ran all over the plane
W:Ah, but he became a greyhound dog
W:And ran her down again
W:
W:  Barking . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a fly
W:And fluttered up into the air
W:Ah, but he became a big, hairy spider
W:And dragged her into his lair
W:
W:  Spinning . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a sheep
W:Grazing on yon common
W:Ah, but he became a big horny ram
W:And soon he was upon her.
W:
W:  Bleating . . .
W:
W:So she turned into a full dress ship
W:And she sailed all over the sea
W:Ah, but he became a bold captain
W:And aboard of her went he
W:
W:  Ordering . . .
W:
W:So the lady she turned into a cloud
W:Floating away in the air
W:Ah, but he became a lightning flash
W:And zipped right into her
W:
W:  Shocking . . .
W:
W:So she turned into a mulberry tree
W:A mulberry tree in the wood
W:Ah, but he came forth as the morning dew
W:And sprinkled her where she stood.
W:
W:  Dripping . . .
W:
W:So the lady she ran into the bedroom
W:And she changed into a bed
W:Ah, but he became a green coverlet
W:And he gained her maidenhead
W:
W:And once she woke he took her so
W:And still he bad her bide
W:And the lusty smith became her love
W:For all of her mighty pride.
