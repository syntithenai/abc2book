N:
N:Jehile Kirkhuff was a blind fiddler who lived on a mountain in Northeast
N:Pennsylvania. He was a good match for the stereotype of the Southern
N:Appalachian fiddler, apart from the geography. His area is, in fact, near
N:the northern limits of the Appalachian range. For years, Jehile had
N:traveled a few circuits in Pennsylvania and New York, where people looked
N:forward to the next square dance he would play. He had lost his sight in
N:his teens (I believe -- I'm not sure of the chronology.).
N:
N:He played quite slowly and clearly -- it was easy to learn tunes from him,
N:especially since he was very generous with his tunes and his time. Many of
N:his tunes were from Cole's 1000 tunes, a reprinting of Ryan's 1050 Tunes
N:(1880s). I had asked his to play local tunes, rather than book tunes, when
N:he gave me this one.
