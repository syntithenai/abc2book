W: Eileen Og for that the darlin's name is
W: Through the barony her features they were famous
W: And if we loved her who could ever blame us
W: For wasn't she the pride of Petrovor.
W: But her beauty made us all so shy,
W: Not a man among us could look her in the eye
W: Boys, oh boys, that's now the reason why
W: We're lamenting for the pride of Petrovor.
W:
W: Chorus:
W:    Eileen Og, me heart is turning grey
W:    Ever since the day you wandered far away
W:    Eileen Og, there's good fish in the sea
W:    But there's no one like the pride of Petrovor.
W:
W: Friday night at the fair of Balatober []
W: Eileen met McGrath, the cattle jobber
W: I'd like to set me mark upon that robber
W: For he stole away the pride of Petrovar.
W: He didn't seem to notice her at all
W: Even when she ogled him underneath her shawl
W: Lookin' big and masterful while she was lookin small
W: Most provoking for pride of Petrovar.
W: Chorus.
W:
W: So it went as it had in the beginning,
W: Eileen Og was big upon the winnin'
W: While big McGrath contentedly was grinnin'
W: At being courted by the pride of Petrovar.
W: Said he, "I know a girl who could knock you into fits."
W: At that lovely Eileen nearly lost her wits.
W: But the upshot of the ruction is that now the robber sits
W: With his arm around the pride of Petrovor.
W:
W: Chorus.
W:
W: So, me boys with fate it's hard to grapple
W: Of me eye, sure Eileen was the apple
W: And now to see her going to the chapel
W: with the hardest featured man in Petrovor.
W: So me boys, here's all I have to say
W: When you do your courtin', make no display
W: And if you want them to run after you,
W: Walk the other way
W:  For they're mostly like the pride of Petrovar
W:
W: Chorus.
