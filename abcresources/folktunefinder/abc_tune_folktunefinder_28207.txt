W:As I was a-walking one fine summer's morning,
W:One fine summer's morning all early in May,
W:Who should I spy but my own daughter Mary,
W:All wrapped up in flannel some hot summer's day.
W:
W:"O mother, O mother, come sit you down by me,
W:Come sit you down by me and pity my case:
W:It's of a young officer lately deserted,
W:See how he has brought me to shame and disgrace."
W:
W:"O daughter, O daughter, why hadn't you told me
W:Why hadn't you told me, we'd took it in time,"
W:"I might have got salts and pills of white mercury,
W:But now I' m a young girl cut down in my prime. "
W:
W:"O doctor, O doctor, come wash up your bottles,
W:Come wash up your bottles and wipe them quite dry,
W:My bones they are aching, my poor heart's a-breaking,
W:And I in a deep solemn fashion must die.
W:
W:Have six jolly fellows to carry my coffin,
W:Have six pretty maidens to bear up my pall,
W:Give to each pretty fair maid a glass of brown ale
W:Saying, "Here lies the bones of a true-hearted girl".
W:
W:Come rattle your drums and play your fifes merrily,
W:Merrily play the dead marches along,
W:And over my coffin tl@ow handfuls of laurel
W:Saying, "There goes a true-hearted girl to her home".'
