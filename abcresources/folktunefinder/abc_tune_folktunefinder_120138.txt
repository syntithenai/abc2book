N:"Old Pat Kane" was a Wexford 
N:man who worked on a rich man's 
N:estate in the Philadelphia suburbs. 
N:Ed visited Pat and his wife 
N:in the early seventies, a year 
N:or so after his visit to Ireland. 
N:Pat worked the farm much as he did 
N:in the Old Country and he had 
N:great flavor in his language. He 
N:liked his bottle of "Porther," 
N:whenever he could get it. He 
N:often exclaimed that man needed 
N:nothing else to sustain himself 
N:in this life. "It is more 
N:than a drink," he was heard to 
N:say-"it's both meat and dhrink."
