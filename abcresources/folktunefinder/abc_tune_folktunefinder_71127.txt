W:The accent upon the a in 2nd and 3rd bard &c give character to the tune.
W:This tune (Lady Mary Ramsay) is called "The auld toon o'Edinburgh" in James
W:Porteous's Collection and having his initials attached it is possible he may
W:have been the composer of it.
W:Note: The score had turns between notes. The only way I could figure out to
W:imitate that was to add an invisible rest, which, however, forced a space
W:between the notes. rp
