W:  Chorus:
W:  Thyme it is a precious thing
W:  Thyme brings all things to your mind
W:  Thyme with all its labors, along with all its joys
W:  And its thyme brings all things to an end
W:
W:Once I had a sprig of thyme
W:I thought it never would decay
W:Until a saucy sailor chanced upon my way
W:He stole away my bonny bunch of thyme
W:
W:This sailor, he gave to me a rose
W:I thought it never would decay
W:He gave it to me to keep me well-minded
W:Of the night he stole my bonny bunch of thyme
W:
W:So come all you maidens brisk and gay
W:All you that flourish in your prime
W:Beware and take care and keep your garden fair
W:And let no man steal your bonny bunch of thyme
