R:Reel
N:Reilly had a wild look and a fondness for 
N:cheating at cards. Before the night was 
N:finished you could bet your
N:last skin of a potato that Reilly would 
N:be stirring up trouble. No one 
N:knew his first name. He was one 
N:of the "White Hill people" from a 
N:region beyond the northern borders 
N:of Ed's farmland.
