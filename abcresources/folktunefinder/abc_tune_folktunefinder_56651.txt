W:The struggle is over, the boys are defeated,
W:Old Ireland's surrounded with sadness and gloom,
W:We were defeated and shamefuIIy treated,
W:And I, Robert Emmet, awaiting my doom.
W:Hung, drawn and quartered, sure that was my sentence,
W:But soon I will show them no coward am I.
W:My crime is the love of the land I was born in,
W:A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Bold Robert Emmet, the darling of Ireland,
W:  Bold Robert Emmet will die with a smile,
W:  Farewell companions both loyal and daring,
W:  I'll lay down my life for the Emerald Isle.
W:
W:The barque lay at anchor awaiting to bring me
W:Over the billows to the land of the free;
W:But I must see my sweetheart for I know she will cheer me,
W:And with her I will sail far over the sea.
W:But I was arrested and cast into prison,
W:Tried as a traitor, a rebel, a spy;
W:But no man can call me a knave or a coward,
W:A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:Hark! I the bell's tolling, I well know its meaning,
W:My poor heart tells me it is my death knell;
W:In come the clergy, the warder is leading,
W:I have no friends here to bid me farewell.
W:Goodbye, old Ireland, my parents and sweetheart,
W:Companions in arms to forget you must try;
W:I am proud of the honour, it was only my duty-
W:A hero I lived and a hero I'll die.
