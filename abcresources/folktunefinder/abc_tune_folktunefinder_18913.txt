N:Jack writes:
N:It's the tune for a song by the German minnesinger  Walther  von  der
N:Vogelweide, written about 1200; the words begin in a tone of mystical
N:exaltation, a pilgrim talking about his joy in setting  foot  in  the
N:land  the  Saviour walked on.  That's the bit that early music groups
N:frequently perform.  It ends with a call to all-out slaughter of  the
N:Saracens.  It was a rallying cry for what became the Fourth Crusade.
