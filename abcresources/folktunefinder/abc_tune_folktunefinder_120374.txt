N:Named for a keen observer of the music. He was one 
N:of the many Donegal fiddler friends of Ed, who came 
N:often to exchange tunes and old stories. Charlie had 
N:a great head for the music, but not the hands to match. 
N:Trying to finger a difficult passage he was often heard 
N:to exclaim, "They won't go down." But this did not deter 
N:Charlie from becoming an important influence in the 
N:tradition at that time. He affectionately called Ed, 
N:"the Doctor".
