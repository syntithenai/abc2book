% Noted for its dashing rhythm rather than for its melodic merits,
% "The Reel of Tulloch" first appeared in print in the 10th number
% of "Robert Bremner's Scots Reels, or Country Dances" issued in
% 1761. It originated in the parish of Tulloch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland.
% The traditional stories relating to its composition are too long and
% unreliable for narration here. A wild orgie of dancing under
% improbable circumstances in one case, and a desparate encounter
% with swords in another, are given as the inspiration of what has been
% termed "the maddest of all Highland reels". Altho Officer William
% Walsh obligingly favored me with a bagpipe setting of the tune,
% preference has been given to that played by the famous violinist Neil
% Gow,  which leaves nothing to be desired.
