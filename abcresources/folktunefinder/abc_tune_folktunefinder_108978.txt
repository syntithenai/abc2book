W:You may travel far far from your own native land,
W:Far away o'er the mountains, far a-way o'er the foam,
W:But of all the fine places that I've ever been
W:Sure there's none can compare with the cliffs of Doneen.
W:
W:Take a view o'er the mountains, fine sights you'll see there
W:You'll see the high rocky mountains o'er the west coast of Clare
W:Oh the town af Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen
W:From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.
W:
W:It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day
W:Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay
W:Oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen
W:Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Doneen.
W:
W:Fare thee well to Doneen, fare thee well for a while
W:And to all the kind people I'm leaving behind
W:To the streams and the meadows where late I have been
W:And the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.
