N:Mentioned eloquently in Joyce's short story,
N:"The Dead" (in Dubliners). This desolate region reminds us of Yeats'
N:line "the drifting, indefinite bitterness of life" Ed has always felt
N:that far too much is made of Ireland's greenery and not enough said
N:of her terrible greyness. Ed has lived to see the whole of Ireland,
N:and he has tried to get as much of it as he could into his own tunes.
