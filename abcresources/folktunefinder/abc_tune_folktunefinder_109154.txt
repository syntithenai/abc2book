W:It was a puritanical lad
W:His name it was Matthias
W:And he would go to Amsterdam
W:To speak with Ananias.
W:He had not gone but half a mile
W:When he met with a holy sister;
W:He laid his Bible under her breech,
W:And merrily he kissed her.
W:
W:"Alas! what would the wicked say,"
W: Quoth she, "If they had seen it!"
W:"My buttocks lie too low;
W:I wish Apocrypha were in it!"
W:"Peace, sweetheart, for ere we part-
W:I speak in pure devotion -
W:By yea and nay I'll not away
W:Till thou feel my spirit's motion.
W:
W:They huffed and puffed with many heaves
W: 'Til that they both were tired.
W:"Alas, " quoth she, "You'll spoil the leaves,
W:My petticoat's all mired!
W:If we professors should be know
W:To all the congregation,
W:Either at Leyden or Amsterdam
W:It would disgrace our nation."
W:
W:"But since it is that part we must,
W:Though I am much unwilling,
W:Brother, let's have another thrust
W:And take thee this fine shilling
W:To bear thy charges when thou go'est
W:As passage o'er the ocean."
W:Then down she laid and, so tis said,
W:She quenched his spirit's motion.
