W:Her name was Lil and she was a beauty,
W:She came from a house of ill reputy,
W:But she drank too deep of the demon rum,
W:She smoked hashish and opium.
W:
W:She was young and she was fair,
W:She had lovely golden hair,
W:Gentlemen came from miles to see
W:Lillian in her deshabille.
W:
W:Day by day her form grew thinner,
W:From insufficient protein in her,
W:She grew two hollows on her chest,
W:Why, she had to go around completely dressed.
W:
W:Now clothes may make a gal go far,
W:But they have no place on a fille de joie,
W:Lillian's troubles started when
W:She concealed her abdomen.
W:
W:She went to the house physician,
W:To prescribe for her condition,
W:"You have got," the doc did say,
W:"Pernicious anem-i-a."
W:
W:She took to treatments in the sun,
W:She drank of Scott's Emul-si-on,
W:Three times daily she took yeast,
W:But still her clientele decreased.
W:
W:For you must know her cliente-le,
W:Rested chiefly on her belly,
W:She rilled this thing like the deep Pacific,
W:It was something calorific.
W:
W:As Lillian lay in her dishonor,
W:She felt the hand of the Lord upon her,
W:She said, "Me sins I now repents,
W:But Lord, that'll cost you fifty cents."
W:
W:This is the story of Lillian,
W:She was one girl in a million,
W:And the moral to her story is,
W:Whatever your line of business is, fitness wins!
