X:4635
T:Earl's Chair, The
R:reel
H:The story of the tune is told in the introduction to Gearoid O'hAllmhurain
H:and Patrick Ourceau's new CD "Tracin'," a gorgeous album if I need to say
H:that once more. The tune was supposedly composed by an East Galway flute
H:player and an uncle of Mike Rafferty named Pakie Moloney. He composed the
H:tune while sitting on a big rock in the Derrycrag Wood, and first called
H:it "Down between the two Derryoobers"--as he was sitting between the two
H:townlands of Derryoober East and Derryoober West. He later thought better
H:of it and changed the name to a shorter one, "The Earl's Chair," which was
H:the name of the big rock--named after the Earl of Clanrickard who
H:reportedly rested there during his hunts.
D:Patrick Street 1.
D:Mary MacNamara.
