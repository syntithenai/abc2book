W:Who will plow the field now, and who will sow the corn.
W:Who will wash the sheep now, and keep them neatly shorn.
W:The stack that's in the haggard, un-touched it may re-main,
W:Since Johnny went a-thrashing all in the wars of Spain.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Johnny, lovely Johnny, he's sailing o'er the main,
W:A-long with other patriots, to fight the King of Spain.
W:
W:And the girls from the bawn-oag in sorrow may re-tire.
W:The piper and his bellows, (may) go home and blow the fire.
W:At fairs and hurling matches, your likes we seldom see,
W:Till you come home a-gain to us, a-storeen oag mo cree.
W:
W:And a cruel fate will not permit our Johnny to return.
W:His heavy loss, we Bantry girls will never cease to mourn.
W:We re-sign ourselves to our sad lot, and die in grief and pain.
W:Johnny died for freedom's sake in the foreign lands of Spain.
