W:Now as I was a-walking one morning in May
W:I saw a sweet couple together at play
W:O the one was a fair maid and her beauty shone clear
W:And the other was a soldier, a brave grenadier.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  But they kissed so sweet and comforting
W:  as they pressed to each other
W:  They went arming along the road
W:  like sister and brother.
W:  They went arming along the road
W:  till they came to a spring,
W:  Then they both sat down together
W:  just to hear the nightingale sing.
W:
W:Then out of his knapsack, a long fiddle he drew
W:And he played her such merry tunes as she ever knew,
W:And he played her such merry tunes, caused the valleys to ring
W:Hark hark, replied the fair maid, how the nightingales sing.
W:
W:O come, said the soldier, 'tis time to give o'er
W:O no, said the maiden, please play one tune more.
W:I do like your playing, and the touching of the long string
W:And to see the pretty flowers grow, hear the nightingale sing.
W:
W:Now I'm going to India, for seven long years
W:Drinking wines and strong whiskey instead of strong beers
W:But if I ever return again, it will be in the spring
W:Then we'll both sit down together, love, and hear the nightingale sing.
W:
W:Now, said the fair maid, come, soldier, marry me.
W:O no, said the soldier, how ever can that be
W:For I've a nice little wife at home in my own count-e-ry
W:And she is the smartest little woman that your eyes ever see.
