N:Delia's town, just a short distance from her native village of Aughtaboy.
N:Like so many beautiful Irish places names, Aughamore could fit nicely into any
N:charming line of verse.  No wonder the immigrant takes pride in rehearsing the
N:sound of his own native place.  He has lost much, but certainly not all.
N:No feeling can quite match that stirring of the heart when an exile
N:hears his "won place home" spoken on the lips of those he loves.
