N:Ed learned some of the basics of fiddle playing from this
N:old Cavan friend who died in 1969 (just a short time after our visit there).
N:It was also through Pat that Ed (and his brother George) joined the local
N:fife and drum corps in Cootehill. The tunes he learned stimulated an interest
N:in the old marches. Pat also taught him a few traditional tunes that he
N:himself had mastered on the fiddle.
