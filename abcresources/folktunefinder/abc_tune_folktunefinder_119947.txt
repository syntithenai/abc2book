N:Delia's town, just a short distance from
N:her native village of Aughtaboy.
N:Like so many beautiful Irish places names,
N:Aughamore could fit nicely in
N:any charming line of verse.  No wonder the
N:immigrant takes pride in rehearsi
N:the sound of his own native place.  He has
N:lost much, but certainly not all.
N:No feeling can quite match that stirring
N:of the heart when an exile
N:hears his "own place home" spoken on
N:the lips of those he loves.
