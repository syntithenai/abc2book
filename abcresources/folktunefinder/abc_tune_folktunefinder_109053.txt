W:In the sweet country Lim'rick, one cold winter's night
W:All the turf fires were burning when I first saw the light;
W:And a drunken old midwife went tipsy with joy
W:As she danced round the floor with her slip of a boy,
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Singing ban-ya-na mo if an-ga-na
W:  And the juice of the barley for me.
W:
W:Well when I was a gossoon of eight years old or so
W:With me turf and me primer to school I did go.
W:To a dusty old school house without any door,
W:Where lay the school master blind drunk on the floor,
W:
W:At the learning I wasn't such a genius I'm thinking,
W:But I soon bet the master entirely at drinking,
W:Not a wake or a wedding for five miles around,
W:But meself in the corner was sure to be found.
W:
W:One Sunday the priest read me out from the altar
W:Saying you'll end up your days with your neck in a halter;
W:And you'll dance a fine jig between heaven and hell
W:And his words they did frighten me the truth for to tell,
W:
W:So the very next morning as the dawn it did break
W:I went down to the vestry the pledge for to take,
W:And there in that room sat the priests in a bunch
W:Round a big roaring fire drinking tumblers of punch,
W:
W:Well from that day to this I have wandered alone
W:I'm a jack of all trades and a master of none,
W:With the sky for me roof and the earth for me floor,
W:And I'll dance out my days drinking whiskey galore,
