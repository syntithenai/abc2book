W:Beware, young maids, beware;
W:Beware, and read my rhyme;
W:And see that you keep your garden well,
W:And let no one steal your thyme.
W:
W:Oh, when my thyme was new,
W:It flourished both night and day,
W:Till by there came a false young man,
W:And he stole my thyme away.
W:
W:And now my thyme's all gone,
W:And I can plant no new,
W:And the very place where my thyme was set
W:Is all o'ergrown with rue.
W:
W:And rue runs over all,
W:And nothing can it stop;
W:But there grows a flower in my father's garden
W:They call it the fair maid's hope.
W:
W:"Now spring up hope," said I,
W:" And be not afraid of rue ;
W:And if ever that young man come again,
W:He'll surely find me true."
W:
W:The gardener standing by,
W:I bade him choose for me;
W:He choose me the lily, the violet, and the pink,
W:But these I refused all three.
W:
W:The lily I refused
W:Because it fades so soon;
W:The violet and the pink I did them overlook,
W:And vowed I would wait till June.
W:
W:In June the red rose buds,
W:And that is the flower for me;
W:But in laying my hand on the red rose bush,
W:I thought of the willow tree.
W:
W:The willows they grow long,
W:The willows they grow strong;
W:And the whole world over may very well knowv
W:That false love has done me wrong.
W:
W:It's good to be drinking the beer,
W:It's good to be drinking the wine;
W:But it's better far to be on the bonny laddie's knee
W:That's stolen this heart of mine.
W:
W:Farewell to all fading flowers,
W:Farewell to young lovely June,
W:For the grass that was once trodden under foot,
W:Perhaps it may rise again.
