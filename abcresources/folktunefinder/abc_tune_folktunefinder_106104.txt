% This fine air which runs to the unusual number of 14 bars in each part
% was sent me by a Dublin friend, Mr. M. Flanagan, a distinguished
% linguist and scholar. In his leisure moments, he enjoys the music of
% his  fiddle, and  union pipes, being a skillful perfomer on both
% instruments.  A brief sketch of his eventful life appears in Irish
% Minstrels and Musicians.
% Whether suitable to the meter of the melody or not, Mr. Flanagan's
% charming verses will be no less appreciated than his music:
%     Alone, all alone by the wave-washed strand,
%     All alone in the crowded hall;
%     The Hall is gay and the waves are grand
%     But my heart is not here at all;
%     It flies far away, by night and by day,
%     To the times and the joys that are gone;
%     And I ne'er can forget the sweet maiden I met
%     in the valley near Sliavnamon.
%
%     It was not the grace of her queenly air,
%     Nor her cheek of the roses glow,
%     Nor her soft black eyes, nor her flowing hair,
%     Nor was it her lily-white brow;
%     'Twas the soul of truth, and melting ruth,
%     And the smile like a summer dawn
%     That stole my heart away, one mild autumn day
%     In the valley near Sliavnamon.
