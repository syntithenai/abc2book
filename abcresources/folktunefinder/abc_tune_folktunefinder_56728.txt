W:Come all you men of learning,
W:And a warning take by me,
W:I would have you quit night walking,
W:And shun bad company.
W:I would have you quit night walking,
W:Or else you'll rue the day,
W:You'll rue your transportation, lads,
W:When you're bound for Botany Bay.
W:
W:I was brought up in London town
W:And a place I know full well,
W:Brought up by honest parents
W:For the truth to you I'll tell.
W:Brought up by honest parents,
W:And rear'd most tenderly,
W:Till I became a roving blade,
W:Which proved my destiny.
W:
W:My character soon taken was,
W:And I was sent to jail,
W:My friends they tried to clear me,
W:But nothing could prevail.
W:At the Old Bailey Sessions,
W:The Judge to me did say,
W:"The Jury's found you guilty, lad,
W:So you must go to Botany Bay."
W:
W:To see my aged father dear,
W:As he stood near the bar,
W:Likewise my tender mother,
W:Her old grey locks to tear;
W:In tearing of her old grey locks
W:These words to me did say,
W:"O Son! O Son! What have you done
W:That you're going to Botany Bay"
W:
W:It was on the twenty eighth of May,
W:From England we did steer,
W:And, all things being safe on board
W:We sail'd down the river, clear.
W:And every ship that we pass'd by,
W:We heard the sailors say,
W:"There goes a ship of clever hands,
W:And they're bound for Botany Bay."
W:
W:There is a girl in Manchester,
W:A girl I know full well,
W:And if ever I get my liberty,
W:Along with her I'll dwell.
W:O, then I mean to marry her,
W:And no more to go astray;
W:I'll shun all evil company,
W:Bid adieu to Botany Bay.
