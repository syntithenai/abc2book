N:Titles - I'm relatively sure about 'Marcy' rather than 'Nancy', and
N:that's what the second word looks like-the second  title is written in
N:the same/a similar writing.  The writing of the music appears fairly
N:uniform throughout, but the titles seem to be in more than one
N:handwriting.  High Dance - a French English or Scots step or solo
N:dance.
