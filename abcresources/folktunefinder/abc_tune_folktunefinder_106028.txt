% This was the earliest setting of this famous old air which the editor
% could trace. A florid version entitled "Granu Weal or ma-ma-ma"
% obtained from McDonnell a renowned piper in 1797 is to be found
%in Bunting's 3rd collection. The sub-title represents certain passages
% wherein a repeated note reinforced by concords on the regulators
% produced tones like ma-ma-ma.
% Grainne ni Mhaille who flourished in the reign of Queen Elizabeth was
% the most forceful character of her day. Her Irish maiden name became
%one of the allegorical titles by which Ireland is poetically known, and
% eclipses totally those of her two husbands, O'Flaherty and Sir Richard
% Bourke. In the course of time, the original Irish name became
% corrupted to "Granu Weal", "Graina Uaile" ,"Grainu Mhaol, and
% other forms.
