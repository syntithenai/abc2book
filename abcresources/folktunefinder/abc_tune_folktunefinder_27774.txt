T:The Seven Hills of Nijmegen
O:england
M:4/4
L:1/8
C:Gavin Burnage
R:Reel
H:Hills in the Netherlands are scarce, so Nijmegen is very proud of its
H:"seven hills walk". Titles can deceive however: the walk is three and a
H:half hills in one direction and the same three and a half, in the
H:opposite direction, on the way back. Tune (c) Gavin Burnage but
H:transmission between traditional musicians in the traditional manner
H:warmly encouraged.
