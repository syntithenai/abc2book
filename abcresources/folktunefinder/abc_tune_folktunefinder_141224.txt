%%%%  Adapted from memory.  Four-part tune.
%%%%  The pickup notes going into the A part are crucial.
%%%%  -- eric  10/02/00
%%%%  NOTES on construction:
%%%%  line spacing corresponds to staff lines
%%%%  spacing between note letters corresponds to bars
%%%%  accidentals:  ^, =, _
%%%%  - is a tie or slur
%%%%  X == 
%%%%  T == title
%%%%  C == copyright or author
%%%%  M == meter
%%%%  L == length of shortest note (count of one)
%%%%  Q == tempo
%%%%  -- yaps wants M,L,Q in that precise order
%%%%  K == key
%%%%  Getting the key signature switch right is a pain.
%%%%  The new key signature must be on a  line by itself,
%%%%  the next measure must start with a bar, 
%%%%  and the preceding line cannot close with a double bar.
%%%%  Or, embed the key signature with backslashes.
