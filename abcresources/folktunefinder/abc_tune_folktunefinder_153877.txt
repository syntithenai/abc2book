%Posted Oct 16th 1999 at abcusers by Philip Rowe in reply to a
%request from Rod Smith for "old time tunes" Philip said this about
%the tune (and the next 21 in this file): I've dug out 22 of the tunes
%on your list in Nottingham Database format. They have been converted
%to ABC using NMD2ABC and appended to this mail. They are a good
%example of some of the disadvantages of machine formatted ABC, but
%are still pretty much human readable. The conversion programme
%incorrectly uses the P: field for first and second time bars on
%repeats, but otherwise the translation is not bad. Nearly all of them
%have been acquired by "word of mouth", so I can't make any guarantees
%as to authenticity or correctness.

%(Frank's note: I have tried to correct the "incorrectnesses" Philip
%mentions. Hope I got it right!)
