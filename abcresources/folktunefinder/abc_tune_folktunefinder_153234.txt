W:Now there was an old farmer lived over the hill
W:and a poor old fellow they say
W:He was plagued by a scolding wife
W:the worst misfortune that day
W:
W:And as he cut wood in the forest one day
W:between dark mood and despair
W:The Devil himself, he jumped out of the bushes
W:and stood before his mare
W:
W:"What's the matter," the Devil, he cried,
W:"You look so discontent
W:Haven't you got any money to buy your food
W:Or to pay your landlord rent
W:
W:"What would you give me," the Devil, he cried,
W:If I were to end your debate
W:And I gave you money and gear enough
W:So you'd never more want for meat"
W:
W:"But I've nothing to give you," the old man cried,
W:"I've nothing right here to my hand
W:But if you would do what you say for me
W:I'll be at your command"
W:
W:"Right and I'll make you a bargain," the Devil, he cried,
W:"A bargain you just couldn't miss
W:You bring me a beast at seven years end
W:I'll try to say what it is
W:
W:"But if that beast I name aright
W:You mark what I do tell
W:You've got to toddle along with me
W:To view the ovens of Hell"
W:
W:So the old man prospered and prospered well
W:It was all gained and spent
W:Till he came to the end of seven long years
W:Sorely he did lament
W:
W:"Oh, what is the matter" his wife, she cried,
W:"You look so discontent
W:Sure you've gotten some silly young girl with child
W:Making you sore lament"
W:
W:"No, I've made a bargain with the Devil," he cried
W:"It was a bargain I just couldn't miss
W:I've got to bring him a beast at seven years end
W:He's got to say what it is
W:
W:"But if that beast he names aright
W:You mark what I do tell
W:I've got to toddle along with him
W:To view the ovens of Hell"
W:
W:"Oh, never you worry," his wife, she cried,
W:"Be it happens, you'll pay for your deed
W:For the wit of a woman, it comes in handy
W:At times in an hour of need
W:
W:"Go and fetch me the droppings from all of our chickens
W:And spread them all over the floor
W:Stark naked I will strip myself
W:And I'll roll all over the floor
W:
W:"And fetch me the barrel of feathers," she said
W:Of the beasts we had for our tea
W:And I'll roll and I'll roll all over in them
W:Till never an inch be free"
W:
W:So she rolled and she rolled in feathers and droppings
W:from her head right down to her navel
W:By Christ, he said, what a terrible sight
W:She looked far worse than the Devil
W:
W:Then the Devil himself came in
W:He began to steam and to hiss
W:"By Christ," he said, "What an awful sight
W:I'll be damned if I know what it is"
W:
W:He started to shake and he started to quail
W:Saying, "Have you got any more of these at home"
W:"Oh yes," he said, "I've got seven more
W:That in my forest do roam"
W:
W:"Well if you've got seven more of these beasts
W:That in your forest do dwell
W:I'll be as good as my bargain and I'll be gone
W:She's worse than the demons in Hell"
