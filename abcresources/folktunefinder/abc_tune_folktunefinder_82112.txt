T:The Eagle's Whistle
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:I copied the following 11 airs (to "Drimin Donn Dilis") from a MS. book lent
H:me by Surgeon-Major-General King of Dublin (about 1885), who copied them 40
H:years previously from an old MS. book in Cork.
H:
H:I gave a setting of this in my "Ancient Irish Music": and there are two
H:others in the Stanford-Petrie Collection.  These three are in 3/4 time:
H:whereas the setting I now give is in 2/4, which is no doubt the proper
H:original form, inasmuch as this was the marching tune of O'Donovans (See my
H:"Ancient Irish Music", p. 53).  The Cork MS. has this remark:
H:  "The legend tells that with this tune the eagle whistles his young
H:   to rest."
