W:A neat little girl and not a bit shy
W:She told me her father had come from Dungallen
W:And would take her back home in the sweet bye and bye

W:  Chorus:
W:  And what's that to any man, whether or no
W:  Whether I'm easy, or whether I'm true
W:  As I lifted her petticoat, easy and slow
W:  And I tied up my sleeve for to buckle her shoe
W:
W:In city or country, a girl is a jewel
W:And well made for holding, the most of the while
W:But any young fellow is really a fool
W:If he tries at the first time to go a bit far

W:The sunlight was gone, and the evening grew dark
W:Along Whitemans Bridge, and by God in a jiffy
W:My arm was around her, beyond in the park
W:
W:  Chorus
W:

W:  Chorus
