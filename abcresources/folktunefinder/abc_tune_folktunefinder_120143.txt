N:Farley was a great tramp fiddler who roamed 
N:through Monaghan and Cavan on fair days. His 
N:daughter sold the family wares as he played 
N:to the delight of their customers. Ed recalled 
N:one day that Farley played so beautifully that 
N:the daughter threw her arms around him in a 
N:burst of spontaneous joy. Ed never forgot the 
N:wholesome feelings expressed there, nor did 
N:he fail to recognize the life-warming 
N:secrets shared by those who love the 
N:music of Ireland.
