B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  Bunting gives two settings of this air, which he calls R\'ois\'in dubh
H:(The Little Black Rose).  But it is universally known all over Munster as
H:Mairghread na R\'oiste: and I believe that Bunting has given it a wrong
H:name.  The air called R\'oisin dubh, which is known, not only in Munster,
H:but all over Ireland, is entirely different.  It will be found in Petrie's
H:Ancient Music of Ireland, in a major setting; and in my "Irish Music and
H:Song," in its proper minor setting.  The setting I give here of Mairghread
H:na R\'oiste differs a good deal from both Bunting's settings of the air he
H:(wrongly) calls R\'oisin Dubh.  It is more purely vocal.  It has remained in
H:my memory since boyhood, with the first verse of the Irish song, which tells
H:a sad story.  Margaret Roche was condemned to be burned alive for murder.
H:On her condemnation her brother set out post haste for Dublin and was
H:successful in obtaining a reprieve, but arrived home just an hour too late.
H:He then composed a lament of which I give the first verse.
W:A Mh\'airghr\'ead, a Mh\'airghr\'ead, a Mh\'airghr\'ead, na R\'oiste
W:Na g-croibhne geala, na bh-f\'innighe \'ordha:
W:Do bhi duine a's fichid a l\'athair do ph\'osda,
W:A's n\'i'l \'einne be\'o a bhaineas leat, a l\'athair do dh\'oighte.
W:
W:O, Margaret, Margaret, Margarte Roch
W:Of the white hands, of the golden ringlets:
W:There were one and twenty people at your wedding;
W:And no one living belonging to you at your burning.
