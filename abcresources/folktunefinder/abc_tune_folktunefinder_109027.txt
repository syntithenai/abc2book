W:The wind blew high, the wind blew cold,
W:It blew across the moor,
W:When John Jones said to Jane, his wife,
W:"Get up and bar the door."
W:
W:"Oh, I have worked all day," said she,
W:"I've washed and scrubbed the floor,
W:You lazy man, get up, I say,
W:Get up and bar the door.
W:
W:"Oh, I have worked so hard," said he,
W:"I know I can't do more;
W:So come, my own, my dearest wife,
W:Get up and bar the door.
W:
W:Then they agreed between the two,
W:A solemn oath they swore,
W:That the one who spoke the very first word
W:Would have to bar the door.
W:
W:The wind blew east, the wind blew west,
W:It blew all over the floor,
W:But neither one would say a word
W:For barrin' of the door.
W:
W:Three robbers came along that way,
W:They came across the moor;
W:They saws Light and walked right in,
W:Right in through the open door.
W:
W:"Oh, is the owner of this house
W:A rich man or a poor"
W:But neither one would say a word
W:For barrin' of the door.
W:
W:They ate the bread, they drank the ale,
W:Then said, "Come, give us more."
W:But neither one would say sword
W:For barrin' of the door.
W:
W:"Let's pull the old man's beard" said one,
W:"Let's beat him till he's sore."
W:But still the old man wouldn't speak
W:For barrin' of the door.
W:
W:"I'll kiss his pretty wife," said one,
W:"Oh, her I could adore."
W:And then the old man shook his fist
W:And gave a mighty roar.
W:
W:"Oh, you'll not kiss my wife," said he,
W:"I'll throw you on the floor.
W:Said she, "Now, John, you've spoken first,
W:So get up and bar the door.
