T:Bedd Anacreon [Anacreaon's Grave]
R:rid\'ee
C:Ceri Rhys Matthews
H:Bedd means &quot;grave&quot; and it was after some
H:posting by some N american poet type _ Keoth I think - that the
H:idea sort of bore itself of composing a tune in honour of the death
H:of RS THomas, and Piotrv Gwliium made some kind of grammatical
H:mistake which implied that RS thomas was sharing a grave with
H:someone ie Anachreon - a jolly anarchic greek type. Anyway we has a
H:bit of fun at his - William Peterson - expense but came up with
H:a genuine tune which as it happens is a bludy good Ridee if you are
H:into these things.
H: It's a Ridee 6. It rambles between the
H:aeolian and ionian mode but resolves as the gay bard
H:would appreciate in the major key. the extra bar is on
H:purpose and typical and makes dancers feel funny in all
H:the right places. it is flutey.
N:If any of you have the fernhill record with Ridees Pastwn mawr on it
N:then that's the musical pattern and rhythm I'm trying to get here in
N:writing. Also, all the other ways of playing the tune are
N:left out like in the first bar of the &quot;B&quot; part you can obviously go
N:GAB GAB.
B:Dictionary. Anacreon [&amp;-'na-krE-&amp;n] Greek poet c582-c485 B.C. ;
B:famed for satires and for lyrics celebrating love and wine.
B:Bedd means &quot;grave&quot;.
