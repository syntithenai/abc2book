W:Come rise you up, my pretty Polly,
W:And go along with me.
W:I'll take you to the North Scotland,
W:And married we will be.
W:
W:Go bring me a bag of your father's gold,
W:Likewise your mother's fee,
W:And two of the best horses that stand in the stall,
W:For there stand thirty and three.

W:She brought him a bag of her father's gold,
W:Likewise her mother's fee,
W:And two of the best horses that stand in the stall,
W:For there stand thirty and three.

W:She lit upon her nimble going brown,
W:[He] mounted the dapple grey,
W:And when they reached the North Scotland
W:Just three hours before the day.
W:
W:Light you down, light you down, my pretty Polly,
W:Light you down at my command.
W:Six kings' daughters here have I drowned,
W:And the seventh you shall be.
W:
W:Pull off, pull off those fine gay clothes,
W:And hang on yonder tree,
W:For they are too fine and they cost too much
W:For to rest in the salt lake sea.
W:
W:Go get those sickles for to cut those nettles
W:That grow so close to the brine,
W:For they may tangle in my long, yellow hair,
W:And stain my snowy white skin.
W:
W:He got those sickles for to cut those nettles
W:That grow so close to the brine;
W:And poor, kind Polly with a pitifully wish
W:And shoved false Wilfiam in.
W:
W:Lie there, lie there, you low William,
W:Lie there in the room of me.
W:Six kings' daughters you here have drowned,
W:And you the seventh shall be.
W:
W:Hush up, hush up, you pretty parrot bird,
W:Tell none of your tales on me.
W:Your cage shall be made of the yellow beating gold,
W:And your doors of ivory.
W:
W:Up speaks, up speaks that good old man
W:In his rook wherever he be:
W:What's the matter, what's the matter with my pretty parrot bird,
W:She's talking so long before it is day
W:
W:Here sits three cats at my cage door,
W:My life expecting to betray;
W:I was just calling up my pretty, golden bee
W:For to drive those cats away.
