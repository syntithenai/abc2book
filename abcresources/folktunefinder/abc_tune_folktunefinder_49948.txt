W:O, waly waly up the bank
W:And waly, waly down the brae,
W:And waly waly yon burnside
W:Where I and my love wont to gae!
W:I leaned my back unto an aik
W:And thocht it was a trusty tree
W:But first it bow'd and then it brak
W:Sae my true love did lichtlie me.
W:
W:O waly, waly but love be bonnie
W:A little time while it is new,
W:But when it's auld it waxes cauld
W:And fades away like morning dew.
W:O, wherefore should I busk my heid,
W:Or wherefore should I kame my hair
W:For my true-love has me forsook,
W:And says he'll never love me mair.
W:
W:Now Arthur's seat shall be my bed,
W:The sheets shall ne'er be pressed by me,
W:St. Anton's Well shall be my drink,
W:Since my true-love has forsaken me.
W:Martinmas wind, when wilt thou blaw,
W:And shake the green leaves aff the tree
W:O gentle death when wilt thou come
W:For of my life I am wearie.
W:
W:'Tis not the frost that freezes fell,
W:Nor blawing snaw's inclemencie;
W:'Tis not sic cauld that mak's me cry,
W:But my love's heart's grown cauld to me.
W:Whm we came in by Glasgow toun,
W:We were a comely sicht to see;
W:My love was clad in the black velvet,
W:And I mysel' in cramasie.
W:
W:But had I wist before I kiss't
W:That love had been sae ill to win,
W:I'd lock'd my heart in a case of gold,
W:And pinn'd it wi' a siller pin.
W:Oh, oh, if my young babe were born,
W:And set upon the nurse's knee,
W:And I mysel' were dead and gone,
W:And the green grass growin' ower me!
