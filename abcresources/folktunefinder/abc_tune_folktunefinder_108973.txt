W:It's by the hush, me boys
W:I'm sure that's to hold your noise,
W:And listen to poor Paddy's narration.
W:For I was by hunger pressed,
W:And in poverty distressed,
W:And I took a thought I'd leave the Irish nation.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  So, here's you boys,
W:  Do take my advice;
W:  To Americay I'd have youse not be farin'
W:  For there's nothing here but war,
W:  Where the murdering cannons roar,
W:  And I wish I was at home in dear old Erin.
W:
W:I sold me horse and plough,
W:Me little pigs and cow,
W:And me little farm of land and I parted.
W:And me sweetheart, Biddy McGhee,
W:I'm sure I'll never see,
W:For I left her there that morning, broken hearted.
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:Meself, and a hundred more,
W:To America sailed o'er,
W:Our fortune to be making, we was thinking;
W:But when we landed in Yankee land,
W:They shoved a gun into our hand,
W:Saying," Paddy, you must go and fight for Lincoln. "
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:General Mahar (Meagher) to us said,
W:"If you get shot or lose your head,
W:Every murdered soul of you will get a pension."
W:Well, in the war I lost me leg
W:All I've now is a wooden peg;
W:I tell you, 'tis the truth to you I'll mention.
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:Now I think meself in luck
W:To be fed upon Indian buck
W:In old Ireland, the country I delight in;
W:And with the devil I do say,
W:"Curse Americay, "
W:For I'm sure I've had enough on their hard fighting.
