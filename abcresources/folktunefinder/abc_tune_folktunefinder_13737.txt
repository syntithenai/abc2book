W: When troubles surround us, when evils come
W: The body grows weak, The spirit grows numb
W: When these things beset us, God doesn't forget us
W: He sends us His love On the wings of a dove

W: Chorus:
W:    On the wings of a snow-white dove 
W:    He sends His pure sweet love
W:    A sign from above On the wings of a dove

W: When Jesus went down through the river that day
W: Well, he was baptised in the usual way
W: And when it was done God blessed His son
W: He sent him His love On the wings of a dove
