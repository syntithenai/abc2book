C:Ed Reavy
M:2/2
L:1/8
Z:Joe Reavy
N:The home of Matty and Bridie Murphy in the Neale (County Mayo). Ed visited there
N:in '69 withJoe and his wife Mary Jo, (niece of the Murphys). The house was
N:traditionally Irish: no hot water, no "fancy plumbing," only a full
N:measure of love and genuine Irish hospitality. The Murphys follow the
N:simple life and this left us with fond memories long
N:after we returned to the States. May Killour House live
N:on in this traditional tune dedicated to them by Ed.
