W:
W:Touch not the cup; it is death to the soul,
W:Touch not the cup, touch not the cup;
W:Many I know who have quaffed from the bowl,
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:Little they thought that the demon was there,
W:Blindly they drank & were caught in the snare.
W:Then of the death-dealing cup O beware!
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:
W:Touch not the cup when the wine glistens bright!
W:Touch not the cup, touch not the cup,
W:Though like the ruby it shine in the light,
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:The fangs of the serpent are hid in the bowl;
W:Touch not the cup, touch not the cup,
W:Soon it will plunge thee beyond thy control:
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:
W:Touch not the cup, O young man in thy pride!
W:Touch not the cup, touch not the cup,
W:Hark to the warning of thousands who've died,
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:Go to their lonely and desolate tomb,
W:Think of their death, of their sorrow and gloom;
W:Think that perhaps thou may'st share in their doom,
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:
W:Touch not the cup, O drink not a drop;
W:Touch not the cup, touch not the cup;
W:All that thou lovest entreat thee to stop;
W:Touch not the cup, touch it not.
W:STOP FOR THE HOME THAT TO THEE IS SO DEAR;
W:STOP FOR THE FRIENDS THAT TO THEE ARE SO NEAR;
W:STOP FOR THY COUNTRY, THE GOD THAT YOU FEAR.
W:TOUCH NOT THE CUP, TOUCH IT NOT.
