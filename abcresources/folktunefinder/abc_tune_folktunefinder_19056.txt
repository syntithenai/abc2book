W: By the clear and the winding stream
W: In the valley of Strathmore
W: Where my love and I have been
W: Where we'll wander never more
W:
W: But if time was a thing man could buy
W: All the money that I have in store
W: I would give for one day by her side
W: In the valley of Strathmore
W:
W: From the glen of the golden and the green
W: I left for a land far away
W: Where sadness has never been seen
W: Aye, and joy only costs a day's pay
W:
W: In Strathmore there's a long working day
W: For a man with his hands on the plow
W: But it's work I'd be happy to do
W: If at night I were lying with you
W:
W: As I take a long draft from my glass
W: Oh, I'm drinking alone here again
W: And I try not to think of my lass
W: For the old days will ne'er come again
