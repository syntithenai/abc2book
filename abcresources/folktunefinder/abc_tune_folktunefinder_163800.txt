%Here are two ways of representing it.  The first is what I use.  The
%second has an ABC layout exactly corresponding to the book, and plays
%correctly in BarFly, but I can't use it yet because the program still
%prints the part labels in the wrong place (fixable by a crude hack if
%you write the barline on the wrong side of the "[P: ]", but I'm not
%about to perpetrate ABC like that where anybody else might read it)
%and also doesn't yet display the header P: line anywhere.
%
%[snip]
%
%I can't remember what the book was.  The Scots Guards book takes four
%lines over it.
%
%An additional complication is that some bands play each part twice,
%i.e. the header would have  "P:ABAC ABAC DBDC DBDC".
%
%As played by non-pipers, the last two notes of each line are always
%tied.
