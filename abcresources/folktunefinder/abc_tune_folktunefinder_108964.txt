W:As I went out one May morning
W:To hear the birds sing sweet
W:I leaned my back to a garden wall
W:And watched two lovers meet
W:
W:You courted me was what she said
W:You got me to comply
W:You courted me with a merry mood
W:All night with you to lie
W:
W:And when your heart was mine false love
W:And your head lay on my breast
W:You could make me believe by the fall of your arm
W:That the sun rose in the west
W:
W:I wish your breast was made of glass
W:That all in it might behold
W:I'd write our secret on your heart
W:In letters made of gold
W:
W:My parents they have brought me up
W:Like a small bird in a cage
W:And now I am in child by you
W:Not fifteen years of age
W:
W:There's many a girl can go about
W:And hear the birds so sweet
W:While I poor girl must stop at home
W:And rock the cradle and weep
W:
W:Rock the cradle o'er and o'er
W:And sing sweet lullaby
W:Was ever there a poor young girl
W:So crossed in love as I
W:
W:There's many a star shall fade in the west
W:There's many a leaf shall blow
W:There's many a curse shall light on a man
W:For treating a poor girl so
W:
W:Go down in your father's garden love
W:Sit down and cry your fill
W:And when you think on what you done
W:You'll blame your own good will
