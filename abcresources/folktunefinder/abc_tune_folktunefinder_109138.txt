T:Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation
S:Digital Tradition, parclrog
N:Author: Robert Burns
N:The "rogues" concerned are the members of the Scottish parliament
N:who signed the Act of Union with England in 1707. A very powerful
N:song, but hardly suitable for a national anthem in my opinion.  JY
D:Recorded by Dick Gaughan; by Steeleye Span on Parcel of Rogues;
D:also by the Corries and the Dubliners
O:Scots
Z:dt:parclrog
M:4/4
L:1/8
Q:2/4=100
W:Fareweel to a' our Scottish fame
W:Fareweel our ancient glory
W:Fareweel e'en to the Scottish name
W:So famed in martial story
W:Now Sark runs to the Solway sands
W:And Tweed runs to the ocean
W:To mark where England's province stands
W:Such a parcel o' rogues in a nation
W:
W:What force or guile could not subdue
W:Through many warlike ages
W:Is wrought now by a coward few
W:For hireling traitor's wages
W:The English steel we could disdain
W:Secure in valour's station
W:But English gold has been our bane
W:Such a parcel o' rogues in a nation
W:
W:O would ere I had seen the day
W:That treason thus could sell us
W:My auld grey heid had lien in clay
W:Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace
W:But pith find power till my last hour
W:I'll mak this declaration
W:We're bought and sold for English gold
W:Such a parcel o' rogues in a nation
