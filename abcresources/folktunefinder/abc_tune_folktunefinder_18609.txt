W: On the eighth day March it was some people say
W: That St. Patrick on Midnight he  first saw the day
W: While others declared 'twas the  ninth he was born
W: But was often mistaken between midnight and morn.
W:
W: Mistakes will occur in hurry and shock
W: While some blamed the blamed the baby Some blamed the clock
W: With all the questions sure no one would know
W: If the clock was too fast or the child was too slow.
W:
W: The first faction fight in olde Ireland they say
W: It was all in account of St. Patrick's birthday
W: Some fought for the eighth for the ninth some would die
W: Wouldn't see right sure they'd blacken his eye
W:
W: Till at last all the factions so positive grew
W: They both kept a birthday so Pat then had two
W: But father Mulchey showed them their sin
W: Said no one could have two birthdays but for twins
W:
W: So boys don't be fighting for eight or for nine.
W: Don't be always dividing sometimes combine
W: Combine eight with nine seventeen was the mark
W: So let that be his birthday amen said the clerk
W:
W: He was not a twin so our history will show
W: But he sure is worth any two saints that we know
W: So we all got blind drunk which completed our bliss
W: And we keep up the practice from that day till this.
