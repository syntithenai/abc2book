N: I'd like to send my thanks down to Chris Abell of Concord, MA, for a lot of
N: hard  work.   He  made All of Sarah Bauhan's beautiful whistles and rebuilt
N: part of her great Haines wooden flute, so I guess it would be fair  to  say
N: that  he  has been (forgive me!@) instrumental to her success.  I hope this
N: tune sounds OK in your shop, Chris!
