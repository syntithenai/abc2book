W:
W:In Scarlet town where I was born, there was a fair maid dwellin'.
W:Made every youth cry Well-a-day. Her name was Barb'ra Allen.
W:
W:All in the merry month of May, when green buds they were swellin',
W:Young Willie Grove on his death-bed lay, for love of Barb'ra Allen.
W:
W:He sent his man unto her then to the town where he was dwellin'.
W:You must come to my master, dear, if your name be Barb'ra Allen.
W:
W:So slowly, slowly she came up, and slowly she came nigh him,
W:And all she said when there she came: "Young man, I think you're /
W:dying."
W:
W:He turned his face unto the wall, and death was drawing nigh him.
W:Adieu, adieu, my dear friends all, and be kind to Bar'bra Allen
W:
W:As she was walking o'er the fields, she heard the death bell knellin',
W:And ev'ry stroke did seem to say, unworthy Barb'ra Allen.
W:
W:When he was dead and laid in grave, her heart was struck with sorrow.
W:"Oh, Mother, Mother, make my bed, for I shall die tomorrow."
W:
W:And on her deathbed she lay. She begged to be buried by him,
W:And sore repented of the day that she did e'er deny him.
W:
W:"Farewell," she said, "ye virgins all, and shun the fault I fell in,
W:Henceforth take warning by the fall of cruel Barb'ra Allen."
