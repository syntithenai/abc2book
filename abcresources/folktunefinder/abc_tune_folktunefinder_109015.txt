W:Early one morning as the sun was adorning,
W:The birds on the bushes did warble and sing,
W:Gay lads and young lasses in couples were sporting
W:ln yonder green valley, their work to begin.
W:
W:I spied one among them, she was fairer than any,
W:Her cheeks like the red rose than none can excel,
W:Her skin like the lily that grows in yon valley,
W:And she's only a hard-working factory girl.
W:
W:I stepped up to her, more closely to view her,
W:When on me she cast a look of disdain,
W:Saying, "Young man, stand off me and do not come near me
W:I work for my living and think it no shame."
W:
W:"It's not for to scorn you, fair maid, I adorn you,
W:But grant me one favour, love: where do you dwell"
W:"Kind sir, you'll excuse me, for now I must leave you,
W:For yonder's the sound of my factory bell."
W:
W:"I have lands, I have houses adorned with ivy,
W:I have gold in my pocket and silver as well,
W:And if you'll go with me, a lady I'll make you,
W:So try and say yes, my dear factory girl."
W:
W:"Love and sensation rules many a nation,
W:To many a lady perhaps you'll do well;
W:For I am an orphan, neither friend nor relation,
W:I'm only a hard-working factory girl."
W:
W:It's true I did love her, but now she won't have me,
W:And all for her sake I'll go wander a while
W:Over high hills and valleys where no one shall know me,
W:I'll mourn for the sake of my factory girl.
W:
W:Now this maid she's got married, become a great lady,
W:Became a rich lady of fame and renown,
W:She may bless the day and the bright summer's morning
W:She met with the squire and on him did frown.
W:
W:It's now to conclude and to finish those verses:
W:It's may they live happy and may they do well,
W:Come fill up your glasses and drink to the lasses
W:That attend the sweet sound of the factory bell.
