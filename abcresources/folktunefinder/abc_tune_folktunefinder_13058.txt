W: 1. I sowed barley but couldn't harvest it / I had a dream but couldn't tell what it was
W:    I used to drink cold water / I couldn't drink warm water
W: 2. I had three horses, one of them for riding / Friends, let's get up and go
W:    They shot down Ali Pasha / Let's give the news to his son
W: 3. Pasha used to wear two fur coats / One sable, one fox fur
W:    They show down Ali Pasha / The possession of Van is destroyed
