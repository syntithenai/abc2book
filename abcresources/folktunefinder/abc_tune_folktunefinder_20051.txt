N:"Molly and I wrote this tune in 1985, when we were first together.  It was a
N:spontaneous composition -- where I started playing melody and she played chords, and both
N:the chords and melody evolved as we played it.  We'd played it at home together.  But it
N:was too personal to play for other people -- I felt the same way about 'Ashokan Farewell'
N:at first.  You know, you're not sure if people will like it.  Eventually, we played it
N:at a late night waltz session at Ashokan.  It seemed like the right moment for the tune
N:to emerge.  We originally wrote it in the key of G.  But the melody only uses three
N:strings on the fiddle, and in G you never touch the E string.  Usually, if a tune only
N:uses three strings, I go for the higher strings.  So that is why it's notated here in D.
N:Sometimes we play it in both G and D, to get the full range.  The other thing I do, if
N:I'm playing it in G, is play the B part an octave higher the second time through, to get
N:a different sonority."  Jay Ungar and Molly Mason, RD 1 Box 489, West Hurley, NY 12491.
