W:My name if is George Jones, I am from the county Clare:
W:I leaved my ancient parents and I leaved them living there
W:I fell in bent for roving, 'twas home I could not stay,
W:So much against my parents' will I shipped and went to sea.
W:
W:I shipped on board the Saladin; I shudder at her name.
W:She was a Valparaiso boat bound to the Spanish Main.
W:I shipped as cabin steward; that proved my fatal day
W:When a demon came on board of us and led us all astray.
W:
W:He said he'd work his passage. The ship was homeward bound
W:With copper ore and silver worth many thousand pounds.
W:Besides, two cabin passengers on board of us did come:
W:The one was Mr. Fielding and the other one was his son.
W:
W:Being on a Sunday morning I'm sorry to relate
W:We started this desperate enterprise and first we killed our mate.
W:And next we killed the carpenter and overboard him threw
W:Our captain he did soon meet death with four more of our crew.
W:
W:An oath was next administered to all the rest of the crew,
W:And like a band of brothers we were sworn to be true.
W:Being on a Sunday morning when that bloody deed was done
W:Then Fielding brought a Bible and swore in every one.
W:
W:The firearms and weapons all we threw into the sea.
W:He said he'd steer for Newfoundland, to which we did agree
W:We found with Captain Fielding (for which he lost his life)
W:A brace of loaded pistols, likewise a carving knife.
W:
W:His son he begged for mercy for he was all alone,
W:But his sad tale was soon cut short and overboard was thrown.
W:We served him as his father who met a watery grave;
W:We buried son and father beneath the stormy waves.
W:
W:And next it was agreed upon before the wind to keep.
W:We had the world before us; we were on the trackless deep
W:We ofttimes kept before the wind as we could do no more
W:And on the twenty-ninth of May were shipwrecked on shore
W:
W:To Newgate we were taken, bound down in iron chain,
W:Confessing to our deadly crimes and all whom we had slain.
W:So fare you well, my parents dear, I'll never see you more
W:So fare you well, my own sweetheart, you're the girl that I adore.
