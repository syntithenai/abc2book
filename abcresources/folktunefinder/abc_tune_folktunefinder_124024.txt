W:Tim Finnegan lived in Walkin' Street
W:A gentleman, Irish, mighty odd;
W:He had a brogue both rich and sweet
W:And to rise in the world he carried a hod.
W:Now Tim had a sort of the tipplin' way
W:With a love of the whiskey he was born
W:And to help him on with his work each day
W:He'd a "drop of the cray-thur" every  morn.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Whack fol the darn O, dance to your partner
W:  Whirl the floor, your trotters shake;
W:  Wasn't it the truth I told you
W:  Lots of fun at Finnegan's wake!
W:
W:One mornin' Tim was feelin' full
W:His head was heavy which made him shake;
W:He fell from the ladder and broke his skull
W:And they carried him home his corpse to wake.
W:They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet
W:And laid him out upon the bed,
W:A gallon of whiskey at his feet
W:And a barrel of porter at his head.
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:His friends assembled at the wake
W:And Mrs. Finnegan called for lunch,
W:First they brought in tay and cake
W:Then pipes, tobacco and whiskey punch.
W:Biddy O'Brien began to bawl
W:"Such a nice clean corpse, did you ever see
W:"O Tim, mavourneen, why did you die"
W:Arragh, hold your gob said Paddy McGhee!
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:Then Maggie O'Connor took up the job
W:"O Biddy," says she, "You're wrong, I'm sure"
W:Biddy she gave her a belt in the gob
W:And left her sprawlin' on the floor.
W:And then the war did soon engage
W:'Twas woman to woman and man to man,
W:Shillelagh law was all the rage
W:And a row and a ruction soon began.
W:
W:  Chorus
W:
W:Then Mickey Maloney ducked his head
W:When a noggin of whiskey flew at him,
W:It missed, and falling on the bed
W:The liquor scattered over Tim!
W:The corpse revives! See how he raises!
W:Timothy rising from the bed,
W:Says,"Whirl your whiskey around like blazes
W:Thanum an Dhul! Do you thunk I'm dead"
W:
W:  Chorus
