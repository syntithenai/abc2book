W:Lord Bateman was a noble lord
W:He thought himself of high degree
W:He could not rest, nor be contented
W:Until he'd sailed the old salt sea
W:
W:He sailed to the east, he sailed to the westward
W:He sailed all over to Turkey's shore
W:And there the Turks threw him into prison
W:No hope of getting free any more
W:
W:The Turk he had an only daughter
W:The fairest one eye ever did see
W:She stole the key to her father's prison
W:And there she set Lord Bateman free
W:
W:Then she led him down to the lowest cellar
W:And gave him a drink of the strongest wine
W:Each moment seemed to last an hour
W:"Oh, Lord Bateman, if you were mine
W:
W:"It's seven long years, let's make a bargain
W:It's seven long years, give me your hand
W:That you will wed no other maiden
W:And I will wed no other man"
W:
W:Then she led him down to her father's harbor
W:And gave to him a ship so fine
W:"Farewell to you, farewell Lord Bateman
W:Farewell until we meet again"
W:
W:When seven long years had gone and past over
W:It seemed to her like ninety-nine
W:She bundled up her fine gold clothing
W:Declared Lord Bateman, she'd go find
W:
W:She sailed to the east, she sailed to the westward
W:She sailed till she came to England's shore
W:And when she came to Lord Bateman's castle
W:Straightway she knocked upon the door
W:
W:"Oh now is this Lord Bateman's castle
W:And is his lordship here within"
W:"Oh yes, oh yes," cried the proud young porter
W:"He's just now taken his new bride in"
W:
W:"Tell him to send me a slice of cake
W:And a bottle of the best of wine
W:And not to forget the fair young lady
W:Who did release him when close confined"
W:
W:"What news, what news, my proud young porter
W:What news, whet news do you bring to me"
W:"There is the fairest of young ladies
W:The fairest one eye ever did see
W:
W:"She's got gold rings on every finger
W:And on her middle finger three
W:She's got as much gold around her middle
W:Would buy Northumberland from thee"
W:
W:Lord Bateman rose from where he was sitting
W:His face it looked as white as snow
W:"Oh if this is the Turkish lady
W:I'm bound with her, love, for to go"
W:
W:And then upspoke the young bride's mother
W:She'd never been known to speak so free
W:"Then what's to become of my young daughter
W:Who's just been made a bride to thee"
W:
W:Lord Bateman spoke to the young bride's mother
W:"She's none the better nor worse by me
W:She came here on a horse and saddle
W:She shall go home in a coach with thee
W:
W:"Let another wedding be made ready
W:Another wedding there must be
W:I must go marry the Turkish lady
W:Who crossed the raging seas for me"
