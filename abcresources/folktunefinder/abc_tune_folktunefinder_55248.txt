W:An outlandish knight from the north lands came
W:And he came a wooing me
W:He promised he'd take me unto the northern lands
W:And there he'd marry me
W:
W:"Come fetch me some of your father's gold
W:And some of your mother's fee
W:And two of the best horses in the stable
W:Where there stand thirty and three"
W:
W:He mounted on the milk white steed
W:And she on the dappled gray
W:And they rode till they came to the salt water side
W:An hour before the day
W:
W:"Light off, light off your steed," he said
W:"And deliver it unto me
W:For six pretty maidens I have drowned here
W:And you the seventh shall be
W:
W:"Pull off, pull off thy silken gown,
W:And deliver it unto me;
W:Methinks it looks too rich and too gay
W:To rot in the salt sea"
W:
W:"Pull off, pull off thy silken stays,
W:And deliver it unto me;
W:Methinks they are too fine and gay
W:To rot in the salt sea"
W:
W:"Take off, take off your Holland smock
W:And deliver it unto me
W:For it is too fine and too rich a gear
W:To rot with you under the sea"
W:
W:"If I must take off my Holland smock
W:Then a turn your face from me
W:For it is not fitting that such a ruffian
W:A naked lady should see"
W:
W:So he's turned his face away from her
W:To view the leaves so green
W:And she's catched him by the middle so small
W:And she's tumbled him into the stream
W:
W:Well he swam high and he swam low
W:Till he came unto the side
W:"Fetch hold of my hand you pretty fair maid
W:And I will make you my bride"
W:
W:"Lie there, lie there you false hearted man
W:Lie there instead of me
W:For if six pretty maidens you have drowned there
W:The seventh one hath drowned thee"
W:
W:She's mounted on the milk white steed
W:And she's led the dappled gray
W:And she's rode till she came to her own father's hall
W:An hour before the day
W:
W:The parrot being up in the window so high
W:And hearing the lady did say
W:"I'm afraid some ruffian has led you astray
W:That you've tarried so long away"
W:
W:"Don't prittle, don't prattle, my Pretty Polly
W:Nor tell any tales on me
W:And your cage shall be made of the finest beaten gold
W:And the doors of the best ivory"
W:
W:The king being sat in the window so high
W:And hearing the parrot did say
W:"What makes you cry out my Pretty Polly
W:So long before the day"
W:
W:"It's no laughing matter," the parrot, he said
W:"That makes me cry out to thee
W:For the cat he climbed in the window so high
W:And I feared he would harm me"
W:
W:"Well done, well done, my Pretty Polly
W:You have tuned your notes well to me
W:Now your cage shall be made of the finest beaten gold
W:And the doors of the best ivory"
