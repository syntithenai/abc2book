T:Lament for Donoch an Bhaile-aodha
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  The Irish ode, or lament, of which the following is the air, was sung for
H:me by Phil Gleeson: but there is no need to give it here, as it will be
H:found in Hardiman's "Irish Minstrelsy," vol. ii, p. 272.  It was composed by
H:a well-known Munster Gaelic poet of the 18th century, Timothy O'Sullivan,
H:commonly called Tadhg Gaodhlach, "Timothy of the Irish Compositions," to
H:commemorate the death of Donogh Mac Carthy of Ballea Castle near
H:Carrigaline, 8 miles S.E. of Cork.
H:  As to Phil Gleeson's traditional manner of singing the ode--which he
H:learned of course from older people:--To the note D at the end of the air he
H:chanted, in monotone, a sort of cronaun consisting simply of the continued
H:repetition of the two vowel sounds, ee-oo ee-oo ee-oo, &c., which was
H:prolonged ad libitum: the change from ee to oo being made at intervals of
H:about a crotchet.  Occasionally he ended the cronaun by suddenly sliding his
H:voice up to a third, fifth, or octave--a common practice in laments, nurse
H:tunes, plough whistles, &c.
