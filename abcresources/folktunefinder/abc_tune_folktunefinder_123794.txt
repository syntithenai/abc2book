W:Come all you young females wherever you be,
W:Beware of false swearing and false perjury;
W:For by a young female I'm wounded full soon
W:You see I'm cut down in the height of my bloom.
W:
W:'Twas last Monday morn as I lay on my bed,
W:A young man came to me and these words he said:
W:"Rise up, Thomas Hegan! and fly you elsewhere
W:For vengeance is sworn you by young Fanny Blair."
W:
W:O young Fanny Blair, she is eighteen years old.
W:And, as I must die, the truth I'll unfold,
W:I never stole with her in all my lifetime
W:It's a hard thing to die for another man's crime.
W:
W:The day of my trial Squire Vernon was there
W:And on the green table they handed Miss Blair,
W:False oaths she's a-swearing I'm ashamed for to tell
W:Till the judge cried,"There's someone has tutored you well."
W:
W:The day that young Hegan was doomed to die,
W:The people rose up with a murmuring cry;
W:If we catch her, we'll crop her, she falsely has sworn
W:Young Hegan dies innocent we're all of us sure.
W:
W:There's one favor more which I beg of my friends,
W:To take me to Bloomfield one night by themselves;
W:And bury my body in Marylemould
W:I pray that the great God will pardon my soul.
