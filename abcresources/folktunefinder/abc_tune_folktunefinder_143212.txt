R:Reel
N:Is one of the landed names of Cavan and of old Brefni
N:before it. The O'Reillys have spread far and wide to wherever the
N:immigrant has ventured in his many meanderings. This title could well be our
N:proud county's battlecry, or the triumphant chant of a Cavan footballer
N:scoring a winning goal at Croake Park.
