W:It's of an old and wealthy man
W:He had a daughter and her name was Ann
W:She were handsome, fine and tall
W:She had a loving face withal
W:
W:Sing lady, lady, lady fair
W:Many a suitor had she there
W:A widow's son of low degree
W:Among them all, she fancied he
W:
W:Sing courting, courting, courting cane
W:There's many a courtship all in vain
W:For when her father came to know
W:He sent her far, oh far from home
W:
W:One night as she were lying down
W:The quiet loosening of her gown
W:She heard a low and deathly sound
W:Says, "Loose my bounds, I'm earthly bound"
W:
W:She looked out of her window clear
W:She seen her love on her father's mare
W:"Here's your mother's cloak, here's your father's roan
W:They sent me here, love, to bring you home"
W:
W:He's mounted up, she's on behind
W:And they rode on with contented mind
W:But all along, complaint he made
W:"Oh love, oh love, my head do ache"
W:
W:Her handkerchief from her neck around
W:She bound it round his head around
W:He set her down at her father's door
W:Then her true love she saw no more
W:
W:"Awake, awake, awake," said she
W:"Is no one here for to welcome me"
W:"You're welcome home, dear child," said he
W:"But what trusty friend did come for thee"
W:
W:"Did you not send one I do adore
W:That love so dear and must love no more"
W:Her father frowned and shook his head
W:Says, "Your true love been one year dead"
W:
W:He's summonsed clerk and clergy, too
W:That grave was opened and him to view
W:And though he had been a twelvemonth dead
W:Her handkerchief was bound round his head
W:
W:So a warning to you old folks still
W:Don't hinder young ones from their will
W:The first they love they'll never forget
W:Though he be dead, she'll love him yet
