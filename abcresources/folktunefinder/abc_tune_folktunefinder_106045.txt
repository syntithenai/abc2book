% Early in the nineteenth centtury, this song was composed by a
% modest weaver, Robert Tannahill of Paisley, and was set to an
% alleged ancient Scottish melody by Robert A. Smith author of the
% Irish Minstrel, and the Scottish Minstrel. According to Farquhar
% Graham, editor of Woods Songs of Scotland, not a few of the airs
% in the latter work were composed by Smith himself.
% Whatever the origin of the above melody may have been it has a
% decidedly Gaelic tonality.
