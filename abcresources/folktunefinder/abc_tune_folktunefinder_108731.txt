N:"$" = the usual S with a line through it for  repeat from here.  The
N:second $ is written over the double bar.  The first full bar has a line
N:over it and the word 'biss' - the first 's' written as an old-style
N:long 's' This (I assume!) is 'bis' - twice, so I have written the bar
N:out twice.  The bar also has repeat marks at the end.  As written the
N:music has 8 bars A music and (with repeats) 16 bars B music.
