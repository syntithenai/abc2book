T:Paddy Ryan's Dream
R:reel
H:See also #342
H:Same as the Scottish tune "Miss Lyall"
H:There is a story that goes with this tune (from Ted Furey):
H:Paddy Ryan was the son of a widow who lived in the Midlands. He had a dream
H:that he went to Dublin, and that he walked to and fro on the bridge without
H:stopping, and that he found his fortune there. He told this strange dream
H:to his mother, who sold her only cow, and said: "Padraig, go to Dublin and
H:see about your dream."
H:So Paddy went on the train to Dublin, and there he marched up and down on
H:O'Connell Bridge. He hardly had any money left, but after a while he met a
H:neighbour from home, who said: "What are you doing here, Paddy Have you
H:come to Dublin". "Well," said Paddy, "I had this funny dream three nights
H:in a row that I should find my fortune here on O'Connell Bridge in Dublin."
H:"Well," said the neighbour, "that's strange. I also had a dream three nights
H:in a row that there was a crock of gold buried at the back of your garden,
H:under a gooseberry bush."
H:"Oh, I don't believe that", said Paddy. But that night he took the train
H:back to where his mother lived in County Offaly, and he said: "Mother, find
H:me a spade", and started digging under the gooseberry bushes in the garden,
H:and it was true; under the last one, which was all dry and nearly dead, he
H:found three crocks full of gold.
H:So Paddy and his mother could buy a lot of cows and build a new house, so
H:wasn't it true that he found his fortune marching up and down O'Connell
H:Bridge in Dublin
