T:Job of Journeywork, The (Richard Thompson)
S:David Thomas <David.Thomas@BRUNEL.AC.UK>,irtrad-l, 4/94
M:2/4
R:polka
N:It's a sort of polka.
N:Richard Thompson (of Guitar,Vocal fame) has recorded it as a guitar
N:instrumental that he calls The Job of Journeywork.
N:(on a CD that comes with a book about the guitar maker Dan Ferrington).
N:However it's not _THE_ job of journeywork at all, which he admits.  At
N:first I assumed he'd made it up, but he says he got it in Ireland or
N:at a festival from an Irish musician.
N:It's an odd tune too, modulating to Bminor for the final chord of the
N:A section. There's a triplet in the 3rd bar of the B section that I
N:haven't noted correctly as I'm a novice user of abc2mtex/musictex.
D:Richard Thompson
