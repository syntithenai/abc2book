N:As excellent as the other tunes are, some feel 
N:that Ed's reputation will stand because of the high 
N:quality of his hornpipes. If this dance form were 
N:more fashionable today among the musicians, Ed would 
N:certainly be much more widely acclaimed. No one has 
N:written so many exquisite hornpipes, and the 
N:Grand Hornpipe surely is a fitting example of 
N:Ed's talent for this rhythmical dance form.
