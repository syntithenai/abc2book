W:In 1803 we sailed out to sea
W:Out from the sweet town of Derry
W:For Australia bound if we didn't all drown
W:And the marks of our fetters we carried.
W:In the rusty iron chains we sighed for our wains
W:As our good wives we left in sorrow.
W:As the mainsails unfurled our curses we hurled
W:On the Engllsh and thoughts of tomorrow.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I wish I was back home in Derry.
W:Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, I wish I was back home in Derry.
W:
W:I cursed them to hell as our bow fought the swell.
W:Our ship danced like a moth in the firelights.
W:White horses rode high as the devil passed by
W:Taking souls to Hades by twilight.
W:Five weeks out to sea we were now forty-three
W:Our comrades we buried each morning.
W:In our own slime we were lost in a time.
W:Endless night without dawning.
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:Van Dieman's land is a hell for a man
W:To live out his life in slavery.
W:When the climate is raw and the gun makes the law.
W:Neither wind nor rain cares for bravery.
W:Twenty years have gone by and I've ended me bond
W:And comrades' ghosts are behind me.
W:A rebel I came and I'II die the same.
W:On the cold winds of night you will find me.
W:(Chorus)
