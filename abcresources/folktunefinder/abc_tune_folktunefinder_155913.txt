W:  Chorus:
W:  The people's right demands our song
W:  The right of free elections.
W:
W:For government and order's sake,
W:And law's important sections,
W:Let's all stand by the ballot box,
W:For freedom of elections.
W:
W:Each town and county's wealth and peace,
W:Its trade and all connections,
W:With science, arts must all increase,
W:By fair and free elections.
W:
W:Then thwart the schemes of fighting lands
W:And traitor disaffections,
W:Stand up with willing heart and hands,
W:For fair and free elections.
W:
W:Should enemies beset us round
W:Of foreign fierce complexions,
W:Undaunted we can stand our ground,
W:Upheld by free elections.
W:
W:Elections are to make us laws
W:For trade, peace and protection,
W:Who fails to vote forsakes the cause
W:Of fair and free elections.
