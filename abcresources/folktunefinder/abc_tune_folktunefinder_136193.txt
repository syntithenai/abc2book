Z:"This must be one of my most popular compositions. It came to me while on holiday in Northumberland just south of the Cheviot Hills near the little district of Barrowburn. It was the ideal setting for creating music. Later that night I sat down by the roadside at a little village called Henshaw near Bardon Mill and composed 'The Barrowburn Reel'." Addie Harper
