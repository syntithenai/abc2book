W:I am a sailor stout and bold,
W:Long time I have ploughed the ocean
W:To fight for my king and country too,
W:For honour and promotion.
W:I said: "Brother sailors I will bid you adieu.
W:I will go no more to the seas with you,
W:I will travel the country through and through,
W:And still be a rambling sailor."
W:
W:When I came to Greenwich town
W:There were lasses plenty!
W:I boldly stepped up to one
W:To court her for her beauty.
W:I said: "My dear, be of good cheer.
W:I will not leave, you need not fear,
W:I will travel the country through and through,
W:And still be a rambling sailor."
W:
W:When I came to Woolwich town,
W:There were lasses plenty.
W:I boldly stepped up to one
W:To court her for her money.
W:I said: "My dear, what do you choose
W:There's ale and wine and rum punch too,
W:Besides a pair of new silk shoes
W:To travel with a rambling sailor."
W:
W:When I awoke all in the morn
W:I left my love a-sleeping.
W:I left her for an hour or two
W:Whilst I go courting some other;
W:But if she stays till I return
W:She may stay there till the day of doom.
W:I'll court some other girl in her room,
W:And still be a rambling sailor.
W:
W:And if you want to know my name,
W:My name it is young Johnson.
W:I have got a commission from the king
W:To court all girls that are handsome.
W:With my false heart and flattering tongue
W:I court all girls both old and young;
W:I court them all and marry none,
W:And still be a rambling sailor.
