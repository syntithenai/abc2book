N:I'm told that the road from Carrickmacross to Crossmaglen 
N:is lined with your worst sort of rogues. The verse 
N:perhaps comes from some old cantankerous Irishman 
N:who probably never himself walked this road. If he had, 
N:he would surely have been charmed with the likes of what he 
N:saw and heard. (Another tune to delight Ed's close friend 
N:from Armagh: Lou Quinn).
