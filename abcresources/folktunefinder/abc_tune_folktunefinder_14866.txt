N:translation of note by Breathnach: Mr. Brogan got this
N:from piper Willie Clancy.  It was first published by Petrie
N:as "The Catholic Boys" (P i [The Ancient Music of
N:Ireland], p.144).  He got it from the Lord Chief Baron of
N:Ireland on 15 January 1852.  Petrie said that the old Irish
N:name was lost but this was the name that Clancy had on
N:it.  Stanford did not bother giving any name to it (P iii
N:[The Complete Collection of Irish Music as noted by
N:George Petrie], 282.  Roche also calls it "The Catholic
N:Boys" in a setting which is almost identical to Petrie's
N:(R iii [Collection of Irish Airs, Marches and Dance Tunes,
N:vol. III], 91.
