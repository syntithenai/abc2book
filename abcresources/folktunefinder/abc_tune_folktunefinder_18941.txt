W: The pale moon was rising above the green mountain;
W: the sun was declining beneath the blue sea
W: when I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain
W: that stands in the beautiful vale of Tralee.
W:
W: She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
W: yet 'twas not her beauty alone the won me
W: Oh, no! 'twas the truth in her eye ever dawning
W: that made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee
W:
W: The cool shades of evening their mantle was spreading,
W: and Mary, all smiling, was listening to me,
W: The moon through the valley, her pale rays was shedding
W: when I won the heart of the rose of Tralee
W:
W: Though lovely and fair as the rose of the summer
W: yet 'twas not her beauty alone the won me
W: Oh, no! 'twas the truth in her eye ever dawning
W: that made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee
