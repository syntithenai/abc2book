N:Dedicated to the people of this quaint region
N:of Mayo. Ed was the guest of his daugher-in-law's
N:family (the Murphys) when he visited the Neale in 1969.
N:He was charmed by the simplicity of their life
N:and the realization that many of his own
N:childhood values still remained there.
N:If his plan had been to return to Ireland,
N:the Neale, he felt, would have been a fitting
N:place to settle. But the exile seldom returns in
N:the end, and so the Neale too becomes
N:another part of his ultimate dream.
