W:It's cold and raw the north winds blow
W:Black in the morning early,
W:When all the hills were covered with snow
W:Oh then it was winter fairly.
W:As I was riding o'er the moor
W:I met a farmer's daughter
W:Her cherry cheeks and slow-black hair
W:The caused mu heart to falter.
W:
W:I bowed my bonnet very low
W:To let her know my meaning.
W:She answered with a courteous smile
W:Here looks they were engaging.
W:"Where are you bound my pretty maid
W:It's now in the morning early"
W:The answer that she made to me,
W:"Kind sir, to sell my barley."
W:
W:"Now twenty guineas I've in my purse
W:And twenty more that's yearly.
W:You need not go to the market town
W:For I'll buy all your barley.
W:If twenty guineas would gain the heart
W:Of the maid I love so dearly,
W:All for to tarry with me one night
W:And go home in the morning early."
W:
W:As I was riding o'er the moor
W:The ver evening after,
W:It was my fortune for to meet
W:The farmer's only daughter.
W:Although the weather being cold and raw
W:With her I thought to parley
W:The answer that she made to me,
W:"Kind sir, I've sold my barley."
