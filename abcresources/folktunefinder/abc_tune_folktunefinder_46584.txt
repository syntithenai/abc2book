W:I am a brisk lad but my fortune is bad,
W:And I am most wonderful poor.
W:Oh, indeed I intend my life for to mend
W:And to build a house down on the moor, brave boys
W:And to build a house down on the moor.
W:
W:The farmer he do keep fat oxen and sheep
W:In a neat little nag on the downs.
W:In the middle of the night when the moon do shine bright,
W:There's a number of work to be done, brave boys,
W:There's a number of work to be done.
W:
W:Then I'll roam all around in another man's ground,
W:And I'll take a fat sheep for my own.
W:Oh, I'll end his life by the aid of my knife
W:And then I will carry him home, brave boys,
W:And then I will carry him home.
W:
W:My children will pull the skin from the ewe
W:And I'll be in a place where there's none.
W:When the constable do come, I'll stand with my gun
W:And swear all I have is my own, brave boys,
W:And swear all I have is my own.
