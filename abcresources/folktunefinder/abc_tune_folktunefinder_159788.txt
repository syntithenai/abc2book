Q:300
N:I don't always fall asleep on boats (though that is generally 
N:what happens) and this was one spectacle I didn't miss - a 
N:real galleon with sails and all floating about on the sea. This 
N:reel is to commemorate that wonderful sight. It was used in a 
N:theatre production that was performed at the 
N:amazing cliff top Minack Theatre near Land's End in 
N:Cornwall.
