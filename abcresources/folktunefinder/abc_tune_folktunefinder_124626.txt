% This fine reel first published in 1781 is but one of many composed by
% Wm. Marshall who for thirty years was in the service of the Duke of=20
% Gordon as butler and house steward. In music as in other=20
% accomplishments he was entirely self taught. His playing of=20
% strathspeys and reels was so inspiring, it is said, that neither the=20
% old nor the young could overcome their inclination to dance. As an=20
% amateur violin player of Scottish dance music, he was unrivalled in=20
% the last half of the 18th Century. No composer of his time was so=20
% victimized by plagiarists who appropriated his tunes, changed a few=20
% notes, and passed them off as their own under different titles.
