R:song
H:  Written from memory, as I learned it at home when a child.  There is a
H:good setting in the Pigot Collection, where it is called "Castle Hyde,"
H:showing that that celebrated song was sometimes sung to it.  There was an
H:Irish song to this air in which Shauneen gives an account of his encounter
H:with Death.  The following is a free translation of the first verse into
H:Munster-English dialect:
W:On the road to Lim'rick as I walked fornenst it,
W:  I met ould Daeth by a ditch side there:
W:The ugly thief with his poll against it,
W:  Looked down on me with a dreadful stare.
W:"Welcome poor Shauneen, how far are you walking
W:  I'm a long time stalking by the ditch for you."
W:"Wisha my bones are exhausted, and there's no use talking,
W:  My heart is scalded, a Wirrastru."
