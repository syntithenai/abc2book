N:The concluding line of O'Driscoll's refrain in Yeats' poem, "The Host
N:of
N:he air". 
N:O'Driscoll dreamed that his wife Bridget was taken by the Host as he
N:was
N:laying harmlessly at 
N:cards with "the merry old men." When O'Driscoll awoke from his dream, 
N:all that remained of the dream was the strange unearthly sound of a
N:pipe
N:piping away in the distant air- "And never was piping so sad, And 
N:never was piping so gay."
