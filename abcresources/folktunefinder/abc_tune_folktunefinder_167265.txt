N:This 4-part jig was written for my friend James Dumbelton 
N:who played with me in Waulk Elektrik and now in Spyka. I 
N:probably wrote it for one of his birthdays - 18th 21st so 
N:1996 or1999 -I can't remember! But it's a good one and we 
N:still perform it often in a set with Cassis de Maurice. It is the 
N:2nd track on the Spyka album.
