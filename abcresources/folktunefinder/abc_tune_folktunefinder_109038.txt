W:Ye banks, and braes, and streams around
W:The castle o' Montgomery,
W:Green be your woods, and fair your flowers,
W:Your waters never drumlie!
W:There Simmer first unfald her robes,
W:And there the langest tarry:
W:For there I took the last Fareweel
W:O'my sweet Highland Mary.
W:
W:How sweetly bloom'd the gay, green birk,
W:How rich the hawthorn's blossom;
W:As underneath their fragrant shade,
W:I clasp'd her to my bosom!
W:The golden Hours, on angel wings,
W:Flew o'er me and my Dearie;
W:For dear to me as light and life
W:Was my sweet Highland Mary.
W:
W:Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace,
W:Our parting was fu'tender;
W:And pledging aft to meet again,
W:We tore oursels asunder:
W:But Oh, fell Death's untimely frost,
W:That nipt my Flower sae early!
W:Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay,
W:That wraps my Highland Mary!
W:
W:O pale, pale now, those rosy lips
W:I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly!
W:And clos'd for ay, the sparkling glance,
W:That dwalt on me sae kindly!
W:And mouldering now in silent dust,
W:That heart that lo'ed me dearly!
W:But still within my bosom's core
W:Shall live my Highland Mary.
