W:There was a wealthy old farmer, who lived in the country nearby,
W:He had a lovely daughter, on whom I cast an eye.
W:She was pretty, fair, the fairest one; indeed so very fair
W:There was no other girl in the country with her I could compare.
W:
W:I asked her if she would be willing for me to cross over the plain
W:She said it would make no difference so I returned again.
W:She said that she would prove true to me, till death should prove unkind
W:We kissed, shook hands and parted. I left my girl behind.
W:
W:Out in a western city, boys, a town we all know well
W:Where everyone was friendly and to show me all around
W:Where work and money was plentiful, and the girls to me proved kind
W:But the only object on my mind was the girl I left behind.
W:
W:As was rambling around one day all down on  the public square
W:The mail coach had arrived, and I met the mail-boy there
W:He handed to me a letter, that gave me to understand
W:That the girl I left in old Texas had married another man.
W:
W:I turned myself all around and about, not knowing what else to do
W:I read on down a piece farther to see if those words proved true
W:It's drinking I throw over, card playing I resign
W:For the only girl that I ever loved was the girl that I left behind
W:
W:Come all you rambling, gambling boys, and listen while I tell
W:If it does you no good, kind friends, I'm sure it will do you no harm,
W:If ever you court a fair young maid just  marry her while you can
W:For if ever you cross over the plains she'll marry another man.
