N:Heltor is a rock on Dartmoor. On the very top of it is a 
N:hollow that is usually filled with water. The tor is like an island ringed 
N:with bracken, fenced off from the surrounding fields. You have to 
N:approach it along a narrow footpath, and the view is beautiful. 
N:This tune was written after a day spent up there. It incorporates a 
N:traditional waulking song at the end and is on the Waulk album 
N:House Music.
