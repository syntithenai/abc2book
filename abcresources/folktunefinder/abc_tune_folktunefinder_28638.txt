B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:  To this air there was a violent political and Jacobite song, composed by a
H:man named Barnaby O'Hanlon, a turner, a native of Donegal, who settled down
H:and worked in our neighbourhood for some time.  I learned both air and words
H:in my childhood by merely hearing the people about me singing the song.  I
H:give two half verses here; but I have a full copy.
W:  Our ancestors formerly great valour they have shown,
W:  Great exploits for Ireland's rights since James's war was known;
W:  Likewise the valiant Sarsfield his losses did bemoan,
W:  When he reproved St. Ruth for the losing of Athlone.
W:
H:  Referring to the destruction of King William's artillery train by
H:Sarsfield (Lord Lucan), during the siege of Limerick, this peasant song
H:has the following striking passage:
W:  We rode with brave Lord Lucan before the break of day,
W:  Until we came to Kinmagown where the arttillery lay;
W:  Then God He cleared the firmament, the moon and stars gave light,
W:  And for the battle of the Boyne we had revenge that night.
H:See the ballad in "Ballads of Irish Chivalry," by Robert. D. Joyce, M.D.,
H:p. 11.  Any History of Ireland will tell about the loss of Athlone and
H:the destruction of King William's siege train.
