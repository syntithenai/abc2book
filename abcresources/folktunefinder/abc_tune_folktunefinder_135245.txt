W:"Oh hark! The dogs are barking, I can no longer stay

W:To meet the contract shearers on the banks of the Condamine."

W:"Oh Willie, dearest Willie, don't leave me here to mourn
W:Don't make me curse and rue the day that ever I was born
W:For parting with you Willie is like parting with me life
W:So stay and be a selector, love, and I will be your wife."

W:"Oh Nancy, dearest Nancy, you know that I must go

W:And our shears they will go freely when I'm on the whippin' side."

W:To eat the ramstack mutton on the banks of the Condamine.
W:
W:But when the shearing's over, love, I'll make you me wife
W:I'll take up a selection and I'll settle down for life
W:And when the day's work's over, love, and the evening's clear and fine
W:I'll tell of them sandy cobblers on the banks of the Condamine."
