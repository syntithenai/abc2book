W:|: Oh, won't you rattle me, and oh, won't you chase me,
W:   Oh, won't you rattle me, the little bag of tailors. :|
W:   I went up to Dublin, I met a little tailor,
W:   I put him in my pocket, for fear the dogs would eat him.
W:   The dogs began to bark, and I began a-wailin',
W:   I threw him in the Liffey, for fear the dogs would eat him.
