Q:400
N:I wrote this 3-part jig when I was staying in a house in 
N:Brittany. It was a very old house with lots of nooks and 
N:crannies. One evening as we were sitting around the fire 
N:someone spotted a large rat peering out of a hole beside the 
N:mantelpiece. It disappeared for a second, then re-emerged in a 
N:similar location on the other side of the fire before vanishing. 
N:We never saw it again, but we did hear it scuttling around 
N:inside the walls.
K:Ador
