W:Farewell to pleasant Dilston Hall,
W:My father's ancient seat,
W:A stranger now must call thee his,
W:Which gars my heart to greet.
W:Farewell each friendly, well-known face,
W:My heart has held so dear,
W:My tenants now must leave their lands
W:Or hold their lives in fear.
W:
W:No more along the banks of Tyne
W:I'll rove in autumn gray,
W:No more I'll hear at early dawn
W:The lav'rocks wake the day,
W:Then fare thee well, brave Witherington,
W:And Forster, ever true,
W:Dear Shaftesbury and Errington
W:Receive my last adieu.
W:
W:And fare thee well, George Collingwood,
W:Since fate has put us down,
W:If thou and I have lost our lives
W:Our King has lost his crown.
W:Farewell, farewell, my lady dear,
W:Ill, ill, thou counsel'dst me;
W:I never more may see the babe
W:That smiles upon thy knee.
W:
W:And fare thee well, my bonny gray steed,
W:That carried me aye so free;
W:I wish I had been asleep in my bed
W:Last time I mounted thee.
W:The warning bell now bids me cease,
W:My trouble's nearly o'er,
W:Yon sun that rises from the sea
W:Shall rise on me no more.
W:
W:Albeit that, here in London town
W:It is my fate to die,
W:Oh! carry me to Northumberland,
W:In my father's grave to lie.
W:There chant my solemn requiem
W:In Hexham's holy towers;
W:And let six maids from fair Tynedale
W:Scatter my grave with flowers.
W:
W:And when the head that wears the crown
W:Shall be laid low like mine,
W:Some honest hearts may then lament
W:For Radcliffe's fallen line.
W:Farewell to pleasant Dilston Hall,
W:My father's ancient seat,
W:A stranger now must call thee his,
W:Which gars my heart to greet.
