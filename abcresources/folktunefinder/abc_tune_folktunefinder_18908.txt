W:One night came on a hurricane, the sea was mountains rolling,
W:When Barney Buntline turn'd his quid, and said to Billy Bowling,
W:A strong sou-wester's blowing, Billy, can't you hear it roar now,
W:Lord help 'em, how I pities all unhappy folks on shore now.
W:   Bow, wow, wow, fal-lal-de-riddy-tiddy, bow, wow, wow.
W:
W:Fool-hardy chaps as live in towns, what dangers they are all in!
W:And now they're quaking in their beds for fear the roof should fall in.
W:Poor creatures, how they envies us, and wishes, I've a notion,
W:For our good luck in such a storm, to be upon the ocean.
W:   Bow, wow, wow...
W:
W:Then as to them kept out all day on business from their houses,
W:And late at night are walking home to cheer their babes and spouses,
W:While you and I upon the deck are comfortably lying,
W:My eyes! what tiles and chimney pots about their heads are flying!
W:   Bow, wow, wow...
W:
W:And often have we seamen heard how men are killed or undone,
W:By overturns in carriages, and thieves and fires in London;
W:We've heard what risks all landsmen run, from noblemen to tailors -
W:So Billy let's thank Providence that you & I are Sailors.
W:   Bow, wow, wow...
