W: Chorus
W: My love, she's but a lassie yet,
W: My love, she's but a lassie yet!
W: We'll let her stand a year or twa,
W: She'll no be half sae saucy yet!
W: 1.
W: I rue the day I sought her, O!
W: I rue the day I sought her, O!
W: Wha gets her need na say he's woo'd,
W: But he may say he has bought her, O.
W: 2.
W: Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet,
W: Come draw a drap o' the best o't yet!
W: Gae seek for pleasure whare ye will,
W: But here I never missed it yet.
W: 3.
W: We're a' dry wi' drinkin o't,
W: We're a' dry wi' drinkin o't!
W: The minister kiss't the fiddler's wife -
W: He could na preach for thinkin o't!
