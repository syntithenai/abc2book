T:Kitty, Will You Marry Me
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:I write this from memory, with one verse of a song I heard sung to it:
W:Oh, Kitty, will you marry me Or Kitty I will die;
W:Then Kitty, you'll be fretting for your loving little boy;
W:Oh, Kitty, can't you tell me will you marry me at all;
W:Or else I'll surely go to sleep inside the churchyard wall.
