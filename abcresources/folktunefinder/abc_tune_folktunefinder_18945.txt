X:1
T:The Rummer
W:Our Girls, like our Geese, shou'd be watch'd from the Vermin;
W:That Geese are like Girls then, with Ease we determine;
W:Geese will gaggle, and wander astray on the Common;
W:And gaggle will wander astray will a Woman: [corrupt line]
W:A Goose will sit quiet under Barriers and Locks;
W:But the Goose of a Woman breaks thro' to the Fox.
