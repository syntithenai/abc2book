H:Chappell cites a song which certainly fits the title.  Probably
H:originally from a play, it has a number of specific personal
H:references.  The reference to Wickham may be a seafaring one, as that
H:village is very near Portsmouth, a major port, particularly for
H:military operations.
W:Come, faith, since I'm parting
W:W:And that God knows when
W:W:The
W:walls of sweet Wickham I shall see again
W:W:Let's e'en have a frolic,
W:and drink like tall men
W:W:Till heads with healths go round
W:W:Till
W:heads with healths go round
