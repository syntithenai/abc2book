W:One day as I was walking, I saw a lovely maid
W:Was with her father talking, and this to him she said:
W:"I'm sixteen years of age, you know, I'm tired of my life.
W:Father, I think it is high time that I was made a wife."
W:
W:"Oh! daughter, daughter, don't say so, I think you are too young."
W:Young men they will talk falsehood, they have such flattering tongues."
W:"I cares not for their flattering tongues, but married I will be,
W:When my mother she was married she was not as old as me."
W:
W:Besides, my sister Mary, you very well do know,
W:She had not long been married not many months ago,
W:And now a baby she has got to dance all on her knee,
W:I think it's time that I had one, I'm near as old as she.
W:
W:My mother says I am too young, and that is to my sorrow
W:But, if a husband I could get, I would not wait tomorrow.
W:Be he a tinker or a tailor, it's all as one to me,
W:I'll work and keep him in the house, and use him tenderly.
W:
W:Besides, a good wife I will be and never on him frown,
W:I'll give him money for to spend in any house in town.
W:I'll give him money for to spend, you need not be afraid,
W:So come, young men, come marry me; don't let me die a maid.
