W:While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
W:While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
W:While goin' the road to sweet Athy
W:A stick in me hand and a drop in me eye
W:A doleful damsel I heard cry,
W:Johnny I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
W:With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo
W:With your drums and guns and drums and guns
W:The enemy nearly slew ye
W:Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer
W:Johnny I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
W:Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo
W:Where are your eyes that were so mild
W:When my heart you so beguiled
W:Why did ye run from me and the child
W:Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
W:Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
W:Where are your legs that used to run
W:When you went for to carry a gun
W:Indeed your dancing days are done
W:Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
W:I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
W:I'm happy for to see ye home
W:All from the island of Sulloon
W:So low in flesh, so high in bone
W:Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
W:Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo
W:Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg
W:Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
W:Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg
W:Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.
W:
W:They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
W:They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
W:They're rolling out the guns again
W:But they never will take our sons again
W:No they never will take our sons again
W:Johnny I'm swearing to ye.
