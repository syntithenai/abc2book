N:This is identical to the same tune in BF13.No attempt has been made to
N:edit this tune apart from first three notes
N:in bar 4 which are crotchets in MS., as it seems so far from making
N:much sense. Time signature is given as alla breve - C with a vertical
N:line through
N:it.  Key signature is given as a C# (that's one sharp, not key of) on
N:first line, nothing on second line.   2nd bar of 2nd part - the 3rd
N:quaver (A) appears to be dotted, but not the B
N:The Title is very unclear and could equally well be either of those
N:given here.
