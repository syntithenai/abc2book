W:Three Eynsham laddies went out one day
W:To Lord Abingdon's manor they made their way
W:They took their dogs to seek some game
W:And soon to Wytham woods they came

W:They had not long been beating there
W:Before the spaniel she brought up a hare
W:Up she jumps and away she run
W:And at that same time a pheasant sprang
W:
W:They had not beat the woods all through
W:Before Barrett the keeper came into view
W:When they saw the old bugger look
W:They makes their way to Cassington Brook
W:
W:When they gets there she full to the brim
W:Well you'd 'a laughed to see them swim
W:Ten feet of water if not more
W:When they gets out their dogs come o'er
W:
W:Over hedges and ditches and gates and rails
W:The dogs followed after at their heels
W:You may now say what you will
W:But they have their hare and their pheasant still
