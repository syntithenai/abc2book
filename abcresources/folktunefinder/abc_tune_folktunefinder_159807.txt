N:We played at a festival in Galloway in midgey high season. It 
N:was ok playing because there was a fan (the blowing sort) on 
N:stage to keep them off, but they were vicious the rest of the 
N:time. The only thing that kept them off were paper plates and 
N:net curtains. This tune is on the Spyka album.
