%
% Following the example of Dr. Petrie and Dr. Joyce, whoe collections
% abound in variants, some of which differ but slightly from others in
% their pages; the editor has continued the practice, rather than risk
% the loss of a worthy strain. Of that class is "Fond of the Ladies",
% the opening bars of which remind us of "Sweet Biddy Daly",
% or "The Irishman's Heart to the Ladies" previously printed.
