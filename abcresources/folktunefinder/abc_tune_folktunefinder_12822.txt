W: Ta bean in Eireann a phronnfadh sead damh is mo shaith le n-ol
W: Is ta bean in Eireann is ba bhinne leithe mo rafla ceoil
W: No seinm thead; ata bean in Eirinn is niorbh fhearr lei beo

W: Ta bean in Eireann a bheadh ag ead liom mur bhfaighfinn ach pog
W: O bhean ar aonach, nach ait an sceala, is mo dhaimh fein leo;
W: Ta bean ab fhearr liom no cath is cead dhiobh nach bhfagham go deo

S: Translation from Caroline Foty <fotyc@EARTHLINK.NET>
W:
W: There's a woman in Ireland who'd give me shelter and my fill of ale;
W: And there's a woman in Ireland who'd prefer the strains of my music
W: To the playing of strings; there's a woman in Ireland and nothing would please her more
W: Than me burning or lying in the clay beneath the sod.
W:
W: There's a woman in Ireland who would be envious if I were to get only a kiss
W: From a woman at a fair, isn't it strange, and I love them all;
W: There's a woman whom I prefer to battle and a hundred of them I will never get
W: And there's a beautiful girl who belongs to a man without English, so ugly.
W:
W: There's a woman who would say that if I would wander with her I would find gold;
W: And there's a woman in a shift whose beauty is worth more than the cattle raids
W: With a woman who vexed Ballymoyer and the plain of Tyrone {this is a
W: reference to Maeve and the cattle raid of Cooley, a Cuchulainn tale}
W: And I see no cure for my illness but drink.
