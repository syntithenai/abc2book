H:With two titles of Welsh derivation, both of which escape convincing
H:explanation, this unique progressive dance is paired with a 16th
H:century double-tonic circular tune of haunting familiarity.  The title
H:of the song also connects the tune to Wales, Shropshire lying in the
H:foothills on the English side of the border.
W:Chappell quotes the first of 16 verses set to this tune in the 17th
W:century:
W:The Shrop-shire Wakes, or hey for Christmas, being the
W:delightful sports of most countries, to the tune of
W:Dargason.
W:
W:Come Robin, Ralph, and little Harry
W:And merry
W:Thomas to our green
W:Where we shall meet with Bridget and Sary
W:And
W:the finest girls that e'er were seen
W:Then hey for Christmas a once
W:year
W:When we have cakes, with ale and beer
W:For at Christmas every
W:day
W:Young men and maids may dance away
