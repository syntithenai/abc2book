H:Malcolm Smith was a fine fiddler who played Irish music with gusto.
H:He played several gigs with my wife's band at the Abbey Pub in
H:Chicago and had shared many tunes with both Therese and myself.
H:He had a quiet way of making all who knew him appreciate life a bit
H:more than before. This tune came out of my whistle a few weeks after
H:he died, in his early 40s, of a hereditary heart problem. He spent
H:his entire last day among us playing his music for others. I can't
H:think of a better way to say goodbye. You can hear his playing on
H:recordings of the groups Cantiga and The New World Renaissance Band
H:(available at megastores).
