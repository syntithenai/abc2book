W:Paddy O'Brian left Ireland in glee;
W:He had a strong notion old England to see;
W:He shipped in the Nellie, for England was bound,
W:And the whiskey he drank made his head go around,

W:  Chorus:
W:  Laddy whack, fol de dol, fol de rol I dee dee
W:
W:O, Paddy been never sailing before;
W:It made his heart ache when he heard the loud roar;
W:For the glance of his eye, a whale he did spy:
W:"I'm going to be ate," says Paddy,"by-and-by"
W:
W:O, Paddy run forward and caught hold of the mast
W:He grasped his arms round and there he held fast
W:The boat gave a tip, and, losing his grip,
W:Down in the whale's belly poor Paddy did slip,
W:
W:He was down in the whale six months and five days
W:Till luck one day to his throat he did pop.
W:The whale give a snort and then give a blow,
W:And out on the land poor Paddy did go.
W:
W:O, Paddy is landed and safe on the shore;
W:He swears that he 'll never go to sea any more.
W:The next time he wishes old England to see,
W:It will be when the railroad runs over the sea.
