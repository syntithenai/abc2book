N:" "1"  This note has a natural   written over it, above the stave   The
N:slur joins only the 'F' and the grace notes, but ABC2win doesn't like
N:that.   "2" - grace note (semiquaver) is slurred with the    following
N:note  "3" impossible to show as written!  Main note has a "~" over it -
N: the sign for a turn which is also correctly written out in terms of
N:pitch - the 'B' is shown as a normal sized note,   the others as
N:grace-note size. "4" -" ~" and sign for natural shown vertically
N:underneath it, so it's a turn with an E natural and won't play quite
N:right here.  The final pause is written above the double bar.  Fine is
N:written  below it.
