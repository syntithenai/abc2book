W:There were three ravens sat on a tree,
W:Down a down, hey down, hey down
W:They were a black as black might be,
W:With a down.
W:The one of them said to his mate.
W:"Where shall we our breakfast take"
W:With a down, derry, derry, derry down, down.
W:
W:Down in yonder green field,
W:Down a down, hey down, hey down
W:Their lies a knight slain under his shield,
W:With a down.
W:His hounds they lie down at his feet
W:So well they do their master keep.
W:With a down, derry, derry, derry down, down.
W:
W:His hawks they fly so eagerly
W:Down a down, hey down, hey down
W:No other fowl dare him come nigh,
W:With a down.
W:Down there comes a fallow doe
W:As heavy with young as she might go.
W:With a down, derry, derry, derry down, down.
W:
W:She lifted up his bloody head,
W:Down a down, hey down, hey down
W:And kissed his wounds that were so red,
W:With a down.
W:She got him up upon her back
W:And carried him to earthen lake.
W:With a down, derry, derry, derry down, down.
W:
W:She buried him before the prime,
W:Down a down, hey down, hey down
W:She was dead herself ere even-song time,
W:With a down.
W:God send every gentleman
W:Such hawks, such hounds, and such leman,
W:With a down, derry, derry, derry down, down.
