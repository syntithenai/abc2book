N:(1) The underlay is confusing.  The Lenvoy section is printed after the first verse, which has one set of words and a repeat sign.  The verse printed at the bottom  of the canto part is two sets of words for the A music, but the Lenvoy section is specified to be sung only after the second set. The repeat signs occur in the lute part, at the end of the A section in the Canto part, and in Lenvoy for all parts, but not in the A section of any of the other vocal parts.  There are other reasonable interpretations, but I think Dowland probably meant Lenvoy to be sung (and repeated) after all three verses are sung.  I would not repeat any of the A section words, i.e., I would sing the A section 3 times with different words each time.
N:(2) The Canto part is written with no flats or sharps in the key signature; all other parts are written with a key signature of one flat.
