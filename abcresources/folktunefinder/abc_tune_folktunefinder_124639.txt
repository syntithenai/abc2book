% The origin or meaning of the name of this popular tune defied=20
% investigation and inquiry for many years. Eventually a glance
% thru the pages of McGoun's Repository of Scots and Irish Airs,
% Strathspeys, Reels, etc., Glasgow 1803, led to the solution of
% the puzzle. Among the contents was "Sir Archibald Grant of
% Moniemusk's Reel". The popular name Moniemusk was that
% of an estate, and the full name of the reel being inconveniently
% long, it was abbreviated to "Moniemusk" and the rest of the=20
% name forgotten. The first and second parts as above noted
% constitute the original tune composed by Daniel or Donald=20
% Dow, a musician of note who died at Edinburgh in 1783.
% The third was substituted for the more difficult second by modern
% fiddlers, and the fourth, the editor memorized from the playing of
% Wm. McLean, the greatest Highland piper of his day in Chicago,
% some fifty years ago.=20
