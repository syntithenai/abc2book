W: 1. Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
W:     From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
W:     The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying.
W:    'Tis you, 'tis you must go, and I must bide.
W:     But come you back when summer's in the meadow,
W:     Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow.
W:    'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
W:     Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so.

W: 2. And if you come, when all the flowers are dying,
W:    And I am dead, as dead I well may be,
W:    You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
W:    And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
W:    And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me,
W:    And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be,
W:    If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me,
W:    I simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
