W: "Dumbarton's Drum" you wish to find;
W: The famous song first comes to mind
W: That Jean Redpath was want to croon
W: But could it be another tune

W: There's one solution: look up Gore!
W: If it's not in there I must insist
W: The tune you seek does not exist.
W:
W: Aha! I see it - just before
W: "Dumfries House" - good old Gore!
W: A fine old reel (but that high "c"
