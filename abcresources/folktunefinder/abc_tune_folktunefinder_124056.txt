W:Old Jim Jones the fisher, the trapper, the trawler
W:Jim Jones the fish-killin' banker is dead.
W:No fisherman surely never stepped in a dory
W:Like Jim Jones the fisher who died in his bed.
W:
W:Was there any old fellow tied sods or made bobbers
W:And set out his trawls in the dark it is said
W:No fisherman ever braved such stormy weather
W:Like Jim Jones the trawler who died in his bed.
W:
W:Jim Jones he would shorely go out in a dory
W:And set out his traps all welghed down with lead.
W:No fisher from side on hauled traps with such tide on
W:As Jim Jones the trapper who died in his bed.
W:
W:In the foggiest of weather he'd set out the leader,
W:But who in the devil this side of the Head
W:Could haul up such codfish or pick out the dogfish
W:Like old Skipper Jones who died in his bed
W:
W:There was never such a salter this side of the water;
W:And ne'er such a glutton for eatin' cods' heads.
W:There ne'er was a crackie who could chaw tobaccy
W:Like old Skipper Jones who died in his bed.
W:
W:Was there any old fisher or any old fellow (could)
W:Cut throats or split fish or tear off the head
W:I'm darned if I ever saw one who'd pick liver
W:So fast as our skipper who died in his bed.
W:
W:Is there any old fellow this side of the harbor
W:Sailed straight out the harbor or tacked round the Head
W:It would make you all frantic to sail the Atlantic
W:With old Skipper Jones who died in his bed.
W:
W:His fishing days ended, his traps are unmended,
W:His trawls are all rotten, his fishing boat sunk.
W:His days as a rover are finished and over
W:Old Skipper Jim Jones who died in his bunk.
