W:O, it's night after night, love, I do lay on my bed,
W:With the feathery pillows all under my head;
W:Neither sleeping nor waking, no nor worse (rest) can I find,
W:But the thought of that young man, he still troubles my mind.
W:
W:Now, I will rise then and meet him as the evening draws nigh;
W:I will meet him in the evening, as the evening draws nigh ;
W:And if you think you love a iittle girl, your mind for to ease,
W:O, can't you love the old one, till the young one came on (can please)
W:
W:It's like the flowers all in your garden when the beauty's all gone
W:Can't you see what I'm come to by a-loving that one
W:Now, the grave he will rot you, he will rot you all away,
W:Not one young man out of twenty can a young maiden trust.
W:
W:Now, I'll take my week's wages, to the alehouse I'II go,
W:O, and there I'll set drinking till my money's all gone;
W:Here's my wife and little family at home, starving too,
W:And me in this alehouse, a-spending all that I earn.
W:
W:Now, the cuckoo, she's called a merry bird, for she sings as she flies,
W:O, she brings us good tidings and she tells we no lies;
W:She sucks all small birds' eggs for to keep her voice clear,
W:And every time she hollers "cuckoo!" , don't the summer draw nigh
