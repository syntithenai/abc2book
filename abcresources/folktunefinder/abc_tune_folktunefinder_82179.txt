T:I Bridled My Nag
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:Air and words I learned in early life from hearing the people sing the song.
H:The hero was evidently what sporting people now call a "welsher."
W:I bridled my nag and away I did ride
W:Till I came to an alehouse hard by a town side,
W:There I saw three gentlemen throwing at dice,
W:And they took me to be some noble knight:
W:    With a right fol-ol de diddle, right fol-lee,
W:    And in my pocket but one pen-nee.
W:
W:I ordered a quart of the beer that was strong,
W:And in that quart I ordered a dram*;
W:I fell drinking and they looking on,
W:And they took me to be some nobleman:
W:                              Chorus.
W:
W:I took the dice and I threw one,
W:And as it happened I chanced to win:
W:If they should win and I to lose,
W:What had they to take but an empty purse:
W:    With my right fol-ol de diddle right fol-lee
W:    And in my pocket I've gold plen-tee.
H:* That is, a glass of whiskey.  This mixture, commonly seasoned with a
H:shake of paper, is what the country people used to call "powder and ball."
