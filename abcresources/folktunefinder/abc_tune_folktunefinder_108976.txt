W:Oh say, gentle maiden, may I be your lover
W:Condemn me no longer to moan and to weep
W:Struck down like a hawk, I lie wounded and bleeding
W:Oh let down your drawbridge, I'll enter your keep
W:Enter your keep nonie nonie, enter your keep nonie nonie
W:Let down your drawbridge, I'll enter your keep
W:
W:Alas gentle errant, I am not a maiden
W:I'm married to Sir Oswald, that cunning old Celt
W:He's gone to wars for twelve months or longer
W:And he's taken the key to my chastity belt
W:Chastity belt nonie nonie, chastity belt nonie nonie
W:Taken the key to my chastity belt
W:
W:Fear not gentle lady for I know a locksmith
W:To his shop we will go, on his door we will knock
W:And try to avail us of his technical knowledge
W:And see if he's able to unpick your lock
W:Unpick your lock nonie nonie, unpick your lock nonie nonie
W:See if he's able to unpick your lock
W:
W:Alas sir and madam, to help I'm unable
W:My technical knowledge is to no avail
W:I can't find the secret to your combination
W:For the cunning old bastard has fitted a Yale
W:Fitted a Yale nonie nonie, fitted a Yale nonie none
W:The cunning old bastard has fitted a Yale
W:
W:I come from the wars with dire news of disaster
W:A terrible mishap I have to confide
W:As my ship was a passing the Straits of Gibraltar
W:I carelessly dropped the key over the side
W:Over the side nonie nonie, over the side nonie nonie
W:Carelessly dropped the key over the side
W:
W:Alas and alack I am locked up forever
W:Then up spoke the page boy "Leave it to me"
W:If you will allow me to enter your chamber
W:I'll open it up with me duplicate key
W:Duplicate key nonie nonie, duplicate key nonie nonie
W:Open it up with me duplicate key
