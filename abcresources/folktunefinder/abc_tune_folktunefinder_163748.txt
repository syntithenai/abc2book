N:This tune was written for the scordatura tuning A,DAd and I 
N:recommend trying it out on this one cos you get some 
N:interesting string-crossing on the repeated notes. The easiest 
N:thing to do is to retune your fiddle, then learn it by ear. If you 
N:prefer to read you can copy it out as if you were fingering the 
N:bottom and top strings a tone higher and lower respectively. 
N:Sounds confusing ehIt is!
