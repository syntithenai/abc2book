W:I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore
W:In the good old golden days.
W:They call me a bummer and a gin sot, too
W:But what care I for praise
W:I wander around from town to town
W:Just like a roving sign,
W:And the people all say "There goes Tom Moore
W:Of the days of '49.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  In the days of old, in the days of gold
W:  How often I repine
W:  For the days of old when we dug up the gold
W:  In the days of '49.
W:
W:There was Nantuck Bill, I knew him well,
W:A feller that was fond of tricks.
W:At a poker game he was always there
W:And heavy with his bricks.
W:He would ante up and draw his cards
W:And go in a hatfull blind
W:In a game of bluff, Bill lost his breath
W:In the days of '49.
W:
W:There was New York Jake, a butcher boy
W:He was always getting tight.
W:And every time that he got full
W:He was always hunting a fight.
W:One night he run up against a knife
W:In the hands of old Bob Kline
W:And over Jake they held a wake
W:In the days of '49.
W:
W:There was poor old Jess, the old lame cuss
W:He never would relent.
W:Her never was known to miss a drink
W:Or ever spend a cent.
W:At length old Jess like all the rest
W:Who never would decline,
W:In all his bloom went up the flume
W:In the days of '49.
W:
W:There was roaring Bill from Buffalo
W:I never will forget.
W:He would roar all day and he'd roar all night
W:And I guess he's roaring yet.
W:One night he fell in a prospector's hole
W:In a roaring bad design,
W:In in that hole roared out his soul
W:In the days of '49
