W:Come listen a while and I'll sing you a song
W:Of three merry gentlemen riding along
W:They met a fair maid and to her did say
W:"I fear this cold morning will do you some harm"
W:
W:"Oh no, kind sir," said the maid, "You're mistaken
W:To think this cold morning will do me some harm
W:There's one thing I crave, it lies twixt your legs
W:If you give me that, it will keep me warm"
W:
W:"Since you crave it, my dear, you shall have it
W:If you'll come with me to yonder green tree
W:Then since you do crave it, my dear you shall have it
W:I'll make these two gentlemen witness to be"
W:
W:So the gentleman lighted and straightway she mounted
W:And looking the gentleman hard in the face
W:Saying, "You knew not my meaning, you wrong understood me"
W:And away she went galloping down the long lane
W:
W:"Oh gentlemen, lend me one of your horses
W:That I might ride after her down the long lane
W:If I overtake her, I'll warrant I'll make her
W:Return unto me my horse back again"
W:
W:But soon as this fair maiden she saw him coming
W:She instantly then took her pistol in hand
W:Saying, "Doubt not my skill, it's you I would kill
W:I'd have you stand back or you are a dead man"
W:
W:"Oh why do you spend your time here in talking
W:Why do you spend your time here in vain
W:Come give her a guinea, it's what she deserves
W:I'll warrant she'll give you your horse back again"
W:
W:"Oh no, kind sir, you're vastly mistaken
W:If it is his loss, well it is my gain
W:And you are a witness that he give it to me"
W:And away she went galloping over the plain
