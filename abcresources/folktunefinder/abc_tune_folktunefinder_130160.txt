H:During a music session one night in Enniskillen a member of the audience called Tony Deery requested some O'Carolan music. He and I talked about how O'Carolan visited all the big houses around Ireland and in return for their hospitality he would compose a tune in honour of his hosts. "Would it be possible to have a tune composed in our name" Asked Deery. "Surely I'll give it a try" I replied. This tune was composed with an O'Carolan type feel to it.
