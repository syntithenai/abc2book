W:Oh, a raftsman's life is a wearisome one,
W:It causes many fair maids to weep and mourn.
W:It causes them to weep and mourn
W:For the loss of a true love that never can return,
W:
W:"O father, O father, build me a boat,
W:That down the Wisconsin I may float,
W:And every raft that I pass by
W:There I will inquire for my sweet Pinery Boy."
W:
W:As she was rowing down the stream
W:She saw three rafts all in a string.
W:She hailed the pilot as they drew nigh,
W:And there she did inquire for her sweet Pinery Boy.
W:
W:"O pilot, O pilot, tell me true,
W:Is my sweet Willie among your crew
W:Oh, tell me quick and give me joy,
W:For none other will I have but my sweet Pinery Boy."
W:
W:"Oh, auburn was the color of his hair,
W:His eyes were blue and his cheeks were fair.
W:His lips were of a ruby fine;
W:Ten thousand times they've met with mine."
W:
W:"O honored lady, he is not here.
W:He's drownded in the dells I fear.
W:'Twas at Lone Rock as we passed by,
W:Oh, there is where we left your sweet Pinery Boy."
W:
W:She wrung her hands and tore her hair,
W:Just like a lady in great despair,
W:She rowed her boat against Lone Rock
W:You'd a-thought this fair lady's heart was broke.
W:
W:"Dig me a grave both long and deep,
W:Place a marble slab at my head and feet;
W:And on my breast a turtle dove
W:To let the world know that I died for love.
W:And at my feet a spreading oak
W:To let the world know that my heart was broke."
