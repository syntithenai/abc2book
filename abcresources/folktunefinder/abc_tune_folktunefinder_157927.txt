Q:400
N:I don't like being on ships. I find them so boring I tend go to 
N:sleep, usually on deck if possible. On one such occasion, as I 
N:slept I had a strange dream in which all my companions were 
N:watching a spectacular firework display. When we docked I 
N:woke up to find out that - yes! a spectacular firework display 
N:had taken place from the port town as we'd approached. I 
N:have missed dolphin and porpoise displays for the same 
N:reason. This jig was written after this event and was originally 
N:for the scordatura tuning A,DAd.
