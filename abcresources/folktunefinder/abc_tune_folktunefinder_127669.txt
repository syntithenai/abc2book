% In the days of our fathers, "An Chnoicin Fraoich", or "Little Heathy
% Hill", both as song and air enjoyed no little popularity in the
% province of Munster, particularly in the counties of Cork and Kerry.=20
% As an air several settings of the melody have been printed, but never
% as a hornpipe until now, and under its colloquial name among the
% peasantry.
%   It will be remembered that many notable dance tunes, especially
% hornpipes and long dances, have been derived from song airs, such
% as "The Blackbird", "The Job of Journeywork", "The Garden of
% Daisies", "Rodney's Glory", and many others.
