W:Tom Bolynn was a Scotchman born,
W:His shoes worn out and his stockings torn;
W:The calf of his leg hung down to his shin
W:"I'm bulldog and spanter," says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Tom Bolynn had no boots to wear;
W:He got him a goat's skin to make him a pair
W:The woolly side out, the fleecy side in,
W:Cool in the summer, says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Tom Bolynn bought him an old grey mare
W:Her sides was worn, her feet was bare
W:Away he went through thick and thin
W:I'm going a-courting, says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:He rode over to the Dutchman's hall;
W:There he got down amongst them all.
W:"Come in, come in, I bid you come in."
W:I've come here courting, says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Come in, come in, my welcome guest.
W:Take which of my daughters you love best;
W:I'll take one for love, the other for kin.
W:I'll marry them both, says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:And after the wedding they must have a dinner
W:Have nothing to eat that was fit for a sinner
W:Neither flesh, fish, food, nor no such thing
W:It's a hell of a dinner, says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:And after the dinner they must have a dance,
W:There's none of us know how to lead out a prance;
W:There's none of us knows how to begin
W:"Let's aim at a jig," says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:And after the dinner they must have a bed
W:The floor it was swept and the straw it was spread,
W:The sheets were short, the sides were thin
W:"Stick close to my back," says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Tom Bolynn's wife, and his wife's mother
W:All went over the bridge together
W:The bridge broke down, they all fell in
W:"Get out if you can," says Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Tom Bolynn's wife being of a low squat
W:And out of the water she quickly got
W:And away she went through thick and thin
W:Enquiring for delicate Tom Bolynn.
W:
W:Tom Bolynn crawled in an old hollow tree
W:Very well content he seemed to be
W:The wind it blew hard and the rain beat in,
W:"It's a hell of a lodging," says Tom Bolynn.
