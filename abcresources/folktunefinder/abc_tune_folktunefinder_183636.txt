W:Up in the morning at five, it's a wonder that we stay alive
W:It sets me yawning to great the cold dawning
W:And back to the old, dreary drive
W:
W:Oh dear, I'm going to be late, Gaffer is standing at gate
W:With his hands in his pockets our wages he'll dock us
W:We'll have to buy grub on the slate
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Poverty poverty knock, my loom it is saying all day
W:  Poverty poverty knock, Gaffer's too skinny to pay
W:  Poverty poverty knock, always one eye on the clock
W:  I know I can guttle when I hear me shuttle go
W:  Poverty poverty knock
W:
W:We have to wet our own yarn by dipping it in yonder tarn
W:It's cold and it's soggy, it makes me feel
W:And there's rats in that dirty old barn.
W:Sometimes a shuttle flies out and gives some poor woman a clout
W:She lies there bleeding while nobody's heading
W:Who's going to carry her out
W:
W:The tuner should tackle my loom, but he just sits there on his bum
W:He's always busy a-courting our Lizzie
W:And I just can't get him to come
W:
W:And Lizzie's so easily led, I reckon he takes her to bed
W:She used to be skinny, now look at her pinny
W:It's just about time they were wed
W:
W:Oh my poor head how it sings, I should have woven three strings
W:The threads they keep breaking, my poor heart is aching
W:Oh God, how I wish I had wings.
