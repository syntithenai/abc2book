%
% "The Waves of Tramore", obtained from our versatile friend
% Mr. McCormick, who swings a bow, or fingers a chanter with
% equal facility, is a much better jig than "Larry Grogan" of
% which it is a variant. The latter was composed early in the
% 18th century by Lawrence Grogan of Johnstown Castle,
% Kilkenny, a "gentleman piper", celebrated in song and story.
% "Larry Grogan" was printed in Aird's Selections of Scotch,
% English, Irish and Foreign Airs; Glasgow, 1782, and in
% The Hibernian Muse, London 1787. An unmusical
% second part detracted from its popularity, altho few Irish
% dance tunes have been favored with such liberal publicity.
