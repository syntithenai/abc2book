R:tune
H:  When I learned tihs tune from the singing of my grandmother, about 1850,
H:she was then 90 years of age: and she told me that she learned it by hearing
H:it played on the violin by her grandmother.  There is a setting in
H:Stanford-Petrie: but the version I give here is considerably different, and
H:is, I think, much finer.  This was a "Piece", i.e., an instrumental tune
H:somewhat longer and more elaborate than the ordinary 2- or 3-Part airs.
