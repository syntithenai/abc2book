% Robert Burns' song to this oldtime favorite strain, was in general
% circulation among the Irish peasantry early in the last century,
% and the name is still well remembered. The melody much older
% than the poet's day, was known as "We're a' dry wi' drinking o't".
% In reel time it was first printed in 1761 by Neil Stewart of Edinburgh
% in A Collection of the Newest and Best Reels, or Country Dances,
% Adapted for Violin or German Flute. The traditional Irish version of
% the tune as remembered by the editor may prove not uninteresting
% to the musical student of a later generation. [See #218]
