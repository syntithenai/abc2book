N: This tune was written in memory of my friend Christy Morgan, who died at  age
N: 31,  having been quite ill for several years.  She loved music and toward the
N: end of her life communication was by means of my harmonica.  Her illness kept
N: her  from  doing many things.  In this tune I see here "set free," enjoying a
N: dance in a beautiful evening gown.
