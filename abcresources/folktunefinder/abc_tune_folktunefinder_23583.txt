W:Love will you marry me, marry me, marry me,
W:love will you marry me, and take me out of danger
W:No I won't marry you, marry you, marry you,
W:no I won't marry you, for why you are a stranger.
W:Why didn't you tell me so, why didn't you tell me so,
W:why didn't you tell me so, before you did the harm
W:What harm did I do, what harm did I do,
W:what harm did I do, but roll you in my arms

W:for if I would have told you then I surely couldn't have gained you.
