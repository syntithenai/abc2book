Q:450
N:I wrote this tune after visiting the family home after some 
N:years. There used to be a wonderful view from my old room 
N:of the Ochils stretching towards the West with the Wallace 
N:Monument and Stirling Castle silouetted at sunset in the 
N:distance. However, I was disappointed on this occasion to 
N:find that lovely vista obscured by a new block of flats. Oh 
N:well! This tune is on the Spyka album.
K:Emix
