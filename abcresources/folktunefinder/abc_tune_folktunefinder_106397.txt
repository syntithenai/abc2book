% Though plainly of Scotch origin both in name and tone, "Cuttie Sark"
% is not to be found in any of the old Scotch or Miscellaneous
% Collections which have been examined. Translated in English,
% "Cutty Sark" means Short Shirt, or Chemise, and as far as memory
% serves me, the above setting had been obtained from a comparatively
% modern manuscript obtained from Sergt. James O'Neill.=20
