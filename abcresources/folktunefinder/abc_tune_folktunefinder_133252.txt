S:Brendan Mulvihill
H:Brendan found the manuscript in a certain Charlie Mulvihill's attic (as part of Charlie's estate, not related, as I recall).  Brendan taught this tune at the 1993 Milwaukee summer school, and I transcribed it for the occasion of the Great IRTRAD 1994 Milwaukee Tune Swap.  Only some of the ornaments that Brendan taught us are included.
