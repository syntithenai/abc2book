% This fine jig, remarkable for originality of composition, and the
% technique essential to giving it adequate expression, is a
% masterpiece of execution at the hands of the amiable Patrick
% Stack who obligingly scored it on  paper, after charming us
% with it on his fiddle - Coming from Jerry Breen the much admired
% blind fiddler of North Kerry, it was preserved in the Rice-Walsh
% manuscript and is now recorded for print for the first time.
