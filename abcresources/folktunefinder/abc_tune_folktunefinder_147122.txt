N:My father was a fiddle maker in Scotland and for a while he 
N:had a very talented French apprentice with whom I kept in 
N:touch and visited at his home near Cognac from time to time. 
N:One of his best friends and neighbours is Maurice Dupont, 
N:the famous guitar-maker. Maurice's father, Maurice Dupont 
N:the elder, makes fantastic cassis and I wrote this jig in France 
N:after a fair at which a good quantity of this delicious and 
N:potent liqueur was consumed.
