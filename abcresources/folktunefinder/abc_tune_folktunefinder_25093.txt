Q:3/8=100
W:I'm a decent boy just landed
W:From the town of Ballyfad;
W:I want a situation, yes,
W:And want it very bad.
W:I have seen employment advertised,
W:"It's just the thing," says I,
W:"But the dirty spalpeen ended with
W:'No Irish Need Apply.' "
W:
W:"Whoa," says I, "that's an insult,
W:But to get the place I'll try,"
W:So I went to see the blackguard
W:With his "No Irish Need Apply."
W:Some do count it a misfortune
W:To be christened Pat or Dan,
W:But to me it is an honor
W:To be born an Irishman.
W:
W:I started out to find the house,
W:I got it mighty soon;
W:There I found the old chap seated,
W:He was reading the Tribune.
W:I told him what I came for,
W:When he in a rage did fly,
W:"No" he says, "You are a Paddy,
W:And no Irish need apply."
W:
W:Then I gets my dander rising
W:And I'd like to black his eye
W:To tell an Irish gentleman
W:"No Irish Need Apply."
W:Some do count it a misfortune
W:To be christened Pat or Dan,
W:But to me it is an honor
W:To be born an Irishman.
W:
W:I couldn't stand it longer
W:So a hold of him I took,
W:And gave him such a welting
W:As he'd get at Donnybrook.
W:He hollered, "Milia murther,"
W:And to get away did try,
W:And swore he'd never write again
W:"No Irish Need Apply."
W:
W:Well he made a big apology,
W:I told him then goodbye,
W:Saying, "When next you want a beating,
W:Write `No Irish Need Apply.' "
W:Some do count it a misfortune
W:To be christened Pat or Dan,
W:But to me it is an honor
W:To be born an Irishman.
