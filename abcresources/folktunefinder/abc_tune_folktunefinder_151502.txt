W:In the years long ago when I first left my home
W:I was young and I wanted the whole world to roam;
W:But now I am older and wiser, you see,
W:For that lovely dark island is calling to me.

W: Chorus:
W: O, I've wandered away from the land of my birth,
W: And been roaming around to the ends of the earth,
W: Still my heart is at home in that land far away
W: That lovely dark island where memories stray.
W:
W:One day I'll return to that far-distant shore,
W:And from that dear island I'll wander no more.
W:'Til the day that I die I will no longer roam
W:For that lovely dark island will be my last home.
