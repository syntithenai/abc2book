T:Charlie Mulvihill's Jig
S:irtrad-l, 8/97, Edward A Beimborn
C:Charlie Mulvihill
N:from Brendan Mulvihill
H:Brendan found the manuscript in a Charlie Mulvihill's attic (as part
H:of his estate, as I recall).  Brendan taught this tune at the 1993
H:Milwaukee summer school, and I transcribed it for the occasion of the
H:Great IRTRAD 1994 Milwaukee Tune Swap.  I put in some, but not all,
H:of the ornaments, which he taught us to do.  More rolls and cuts.
M:6/8
R:jig
Z:Alan Ng's contribution.
