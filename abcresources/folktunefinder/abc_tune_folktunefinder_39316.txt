W:They called him Tiny Newman be cause he was so small,
W:No higher than a lamppost not so broad as he was tall.
W:His job was fitting motor tyres he did it with his hands,
W:And he took some home when his mother made jam to use for elastic bands.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Where's Tiny Newman, come sun or rain or snow
W:  Where's Tiny Newman when the morning hooters blow
W:  Turn left at number fifteen gate and that's where Tiny stands,
W:  With the motor tyres all round him and he's fitting them with his hands.
W:
W:One day there was a powewr cut, the coal supply was low;
W:The presses all dropped idle and the line went creeping slow.
W:So Tiny turned it with his hands and he sent it whirling fast
W:Till a copper ran him in for driving two hundred cars too fast.
W:
W:Tiny was a peaceful man, his fights were short and few
W:But a mate of his in an argument once stood on a different view.
W:He held him out of the top of a 'bus between the road and sky
W:When he dragged him in that mate and him saw exactly eye to eye.
W:
W:Now astronomers from all the world are gathering in their crowds
W:To see why flying saucers now come whistling through the clouds.
W:They'll tell you thry're phenomena only science understands
W:But they're Tiny Newman's rejects going hurtling from his hands.
W:
W:And if your little daughter points a finger at the sky
W:And asks why there are stars up there, so sparkling and so high
W:You can tell her Tiny Newman is the one who is to blame
W:Since the night he took up welding, things have necer been the same.
W:
W:Well, no one knew what he should do, the day that Patsy died
W:The tyres of the hearse they sagged and burst with the weight that lay inside;
W:Then an off back dor swung open and a voice behind a hand
W:Says," I'll fit them fur and then no more till I check on at the Promised Land.
