% The name "Rosin the Bow" has clung to the writer's memory since
% childhood, and the tune, like the song about "Old Rosin the Bow"
% (a nickname for the fiddler) may have passed into oblivion, had
% not the melody been fortuitously found recently in a faded
% miscellaneous manuscript collection long discarded by Sergt. James
% O'Neill. A version of it I find is printed in Joyce's "Old Irish Folk
% Music and Songs - 1909".
