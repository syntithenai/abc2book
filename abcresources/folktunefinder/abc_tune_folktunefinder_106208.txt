% Sometimes written "Tulloch Gorum" or Tullagorum", this famous
% strathspey first published in Robert Bremner's Collections of Scots
% Reels, or Country Dances, Edinburgh 1757" was composed by
% William Marshall, butler and house stewart in the service of the Duke
% of Gordon for thirty years. His tunes were plagiarized ruthlessly by
% comtemporaries. In the words of Robert Burns, Marshall was:
%        "the first composer of strathspeys in the age".
% The grace notes peculiar to pipe music are omitted in the setting.
% A clergyman at Linshart, Rev. John Skinner composed songs to
% "Tulloch Gorum" and several others of Marshall's tunes.
