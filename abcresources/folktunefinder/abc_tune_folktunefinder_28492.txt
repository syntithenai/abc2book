Q:3/8=100
W:As I was a walking one morning at ease
W:A viewing the leaves as they fell from the trees
W:All in slow motion appearing to be
W:And those that had withered, they fell from the trees
W:
W:  What's the life of a man anymore than the leaves
W:  A man has his season, so why should we grieve
W:  Though all thru this life, we appear fine and gay
W:  Like the leaves we will wither and soon fade away
W:
W:If you'd seen the leaves just a few days ago
W:So beautiful and bright they all seemed to grow
W:A frost came upon them and withered them all
W:A storm came upon them and down they did fall
W:
W:If you look in the churchyard, there you will see
W:Those that have passed like the leaves from the trees
W:When age and affliction upon us do fall
W:Like the leaves we must wither and down we must fall
