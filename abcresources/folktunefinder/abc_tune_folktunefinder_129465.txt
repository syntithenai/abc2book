% In the 2nd measure Petrie notated the last 3 notes as a 16th followed by 2 32nd notes,
% leaving the bar one 8th note too short.  Also he omitted the repeat sign at the 
% beginning of bar 1 (standard practice) and the rest at the end of bar 12 so it's unclear
% if he wanted the pickup to bar 5 to be an F or a B, and whether he wanted a pickup note 
% on bar 13. -SW
