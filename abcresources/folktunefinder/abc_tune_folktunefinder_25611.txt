W:Come all you jolly ploughboys, come listen to my lays,
W:And join with me in chorus, I'll sing the ploughboy's praise;
W:My song is of the ploughboy's fame,
W:And unto you I'll relate the same
W:He whistles, sings and drives his team,
W:The brave ploughing boy.
W:
W:So early in the morning, the ploughboy he is seen;
W:He hastens to the stable, his horses for to clean.
W:Their manes and tails he will comb straight,
W:With chaff and corn he does them bait,
W:Then he'll endeavour to plough straight,
W:The brave poughing boy.
W:
W:Now all things being ready, and the harness that's put to,
W:All with a shining countenance his work he will pursue:
W:The small birds sing on every tree,
W:The cuckoo joins in harmony
W:To welcome us as you may say,
W:The brave ploughing boy.
W:
W:So early in the morning, to harrow, plough and sow
W:And with a gentle cast, my boys, we'll give the corn a throw
W:Which makes the valleys thick to stand
W:With corn to fill the reaper's hand:
W:All this, you well may understand,
W:Comes from the ploughing boy.
W:
W:Now the corn it is a-growing, and seed time that's all o'er
W:Our master he does welcome us and unlocks the cellar door
W:With cake and ale we have our fill
W:Because we've done our work so well,
W:There's none here can excel the skill
W:Off a brave ploughing boy.
W:
W:Now the corn it is a-growing, the fields look fresh and gay
W:The cheerful lads come in to mow, whilst damsels make the hay;
W:The ears of corn they now appear,
W:And peace and plenty crowns the year
W:So we'll be merry whilst we are here,
W:And drink to the brave ploughing boy.
