W:1. Jolly old Saint Nicholas,
W:Lean your ear this way!
W:Don't you tell a single soul
W:What I'm going to say;
W:Christmas Eve is coming soon;
W:Now, you dear old man,
W:Whisper what you'll bring to me;
W:Tell me if you can.
W:
W:2. When the clock is striking twelve,
W:When I'm fast asleep,
W:Down the chimney broad and black,
W:With your pack you'll creep;
W:All the stockings you will find
W:Hanging in a row;
W:Mine will be the shortest one,
W:You'll be sure to know.
W:
W:3. Johnny wants a pair of skates;
W:Susy wants a dolly;
W:Nellie wants a story book;
W:She thinks dolls are folly;
W:As for me, my little brain
W:Isn't very bright;
W:Choose for me, old Santa Claus,
W:What you think is best.
