H:Here's a translation of the note by editor Jackie Small:
H:"62.  'An Coileach Comhraic':  'The Game Cock' (Breathnach II,
H:p. 90). This is a slide, originally from the David Collins ms;
H:untitled in the ms.  See number 51.  As a strathspey, 'Captain
H:Francis Wemyss' (Kerr III, p. 3).  'The Game Cock' as a reel in
H:RMC, whence the title here.  Another name for it is 'Those
H:Evening Bells Reel'.  Related to 'The Western Lasses' (DMI, 765).
H:It is played as a reel in Sliabh Luachra: Breathnach recorded it
H:from the fiddler Jack Connell (or Jack the Lighthouse, as he
H:was better known, from the townland where he lived).  Jackie
H:Daly, the renowned accordion player from Kanturk in Co. Cork,
H:composed an extra part for it: he calls the entire reel 'The Bog
H:Carrot', which he has put on a record ('Buttons and Bows':
H:Green Linnet SIF 1051; now on compact disc GLCD 1051)."
