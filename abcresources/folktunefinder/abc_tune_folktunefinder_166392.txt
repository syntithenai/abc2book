W:In Seaport town there lived a merchant
W:He had two sons and a daughter dear
W:And among them all was the prettiest boy (there was a servant)
W:He was the daughter's dearest dear.
W:
W:One evening late they were in the room courting.
W:Her oldest brother perchance did hear;
W:He went and told his other brothers:
W:Let's deprive her of her dearest dear.
W:
W:They rose up early the next morning,
W:A game of hunting for to go;
W:And upon this young man they both insisted
W:For him to go along with them.
W:
W:They wandered over the hills and mountains
W:And through a many of a place unknown,
W:'Till at last they came to a lonesome valley
W:And there they killed him dead alone.
W:
W:When they return back the next evening,
W:Their sister ask for the servant man
W:Saying: We lost him on a game of hunting;
W:No more of him it's could we find.
W:
W:While she lie on her bedside slumbering,
W:The servant man did appear to her,
W:Saying: Your brothers killed me rough and cruel
W:All wallowed in a score of blood
W:
W:She rose up early the next morning;
W:She dressed herself in a rich array,
W:Saying: I'll go and find my best beloved
W:All wallowed in a score of blood.
W:
W:She wandered over the hills and mountains
W:And through a many of a place unknown,
W:Till at last she came to the lonesome valley,
W:And there she found him dead alone.
W:
W:Saying: Your eyes look like some bloody butcher,
W:Your eyes look like some salt or brine.
W:She kissed his cold, cold lips and, crying,
W:Said: You are the darling bosom friend of mine.
W:
W:Since my brothers been so cruel
W:As to force your sweet love away,
W:One grave shall preserve us both together,
W:As long as I have breath I will stay with you.
W:
W:When she return back the next evening,
W:Her brothers ask her where she'd been.
W:O hold your tongue, you deceitful villains,
W:For one alone you both shall hang.
W:
W:Her brothers then they came convicted
W:To jump in a boat and a-finally leave.
W:The wind did blow and the waves came o'er them
W:They made their graves in the deep blue sea
