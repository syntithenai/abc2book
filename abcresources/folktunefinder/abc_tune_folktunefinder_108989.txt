W:It's hard when folks can't find their work
W:where they've been bred and born
W:When I was young I always thought
W:I'd bide among fruits and corn
W:But I've been forced to work in towns
W:so here's my litany
W:From Hull and Halifax and Hell
W:Good Lord deliver me
W:
W:When I was courting Mary Jane
W:The old Squire he said one day
W:I've no room here for wedded folks
W:Choose whether to wed or stay
W:Well I couldn't give up the lass that I loved
W:So to town we had to flee
W:From Hull and Halifax and Hell
W:Good Lord deliver me
W:
W:I've worked in Leeds and Huddersfield
W:and addled honest brass
W:At Bradford, Keighley, Rotterham
W:I've kept m'bairns and m'lass
W:I've travelled all three Ridings round
W:And once I went to sea
W:From forges, mills and sailing ships
W:Good Lord deliver me
W:
W:I've walked at night thru Sheffield lanes
W:T'was the same as being in Hell
W:Where furnaces thrust out tongues of fire
W:and roared like the wind on the fell
W:And I've shovelled coals in the Barnsley pits
W:with muck up to m'knee
W:From Sheffield, Barnsley, Rotterham
W:Good Lord deliver me
W:
W:I've seen fog creeping across Leeds brig
W:as thick as Bastille soup
W:I've lived where folks were stowed away
W:like rabbits in a coop
W:And I've seen snow float down Bradford Beck
W:as black as ebony
W:From Hunslet, Holbeck, Wibsley Slack
W:Good lord deliver me
W:
W:Well now our children are all fled
W:to the country we've come back
W:There's forty miles of heathery moor
W:'twixt us and the coal pits slack
W:And as I sit by the fire at night
W:I laugh and shout with glee
W:From Hull and Halifax and Hell
W:Good Lord deliver me.
