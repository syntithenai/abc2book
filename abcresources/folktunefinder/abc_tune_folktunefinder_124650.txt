%
% "The Factory Lass" was first heard by the editor at Gaelic Park
% Chicago on July 4th, '22. It was cleverly rendered in concert by
% Mr. Mullaney, Miss Geary, and Mr. McGrath, on the Irish or Union
% Pipes, Violin, and Flute, respectively. The similarity of strain,=20
% especially in the the first part, to that of the "Home Made Reel"
% which follows [#233] may be noticed.
