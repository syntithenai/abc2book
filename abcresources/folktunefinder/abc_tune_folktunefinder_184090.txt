W:1. Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
W:And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee.
W:Little Jackie Paper loved that rascal Puff
W:And brought him strings and sealing wax and other fancy stuff. Oh!
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
W:And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee.
W:Puff, the magic dragon, lived by the sea
W:And frolicked in the autumn mist in a land called Honalee.

W:2. Together they would travel on a boat with billowed sail.
W:Jackie kept a lookout perched on Puff's gigantic tail.
W:Noble kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
W:Pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name. Oh!
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:3. A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.
W:Painted wings and giant rings make way for other toys.
W:One grey night it happened, Jackie Paper came no more
W:And Puff that mighty dragon, he ceased his fearless roar.
W:
W:4. His head was bent in sorrow, green scales fell like rain
W:Puff no longer went to play along the cherry lane.
W:Without his lifelong friend, Puff could not be brave.
W:So, Puff that mighty dragon sadly slipped into his cave. Oh!
W:(Chorus)
