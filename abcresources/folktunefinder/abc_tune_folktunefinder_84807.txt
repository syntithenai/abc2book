X:85
T:Newcastle
R:jig
H:Simpson feels that the surviving tune is not the one which had some
H:currency in Elizabethan days. He points out that wrenchings of accent
H:are necessary to accomplish the fit of Playford's dance tune to a
H:curious fragment of text found in the 18th century Percy folio MS, a
H:source of dubious authenticity itself.
H:__ Came you not from Newcastle __
H:__ Came yee not there away &c __
H:It is quite possible that this dance was inspired by William,
H:Duke of Newcastle, a royalist who remained in London and bent
H:his interests towards the theatre during the interregnum.
