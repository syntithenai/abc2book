T:Funeral March
O:Japan
N:I don't know the original title, author, etc. of this tune. I heard it in the 
N:movie `Akiro Kurosawa's Dreams' of the famous Japanese director Akiro Kurosawa.
N:It's played during the funeral (hence the title) in the part of the village by 
N:the river.
N:The tune is rather short, but quite hypnotic when repeated several hundreds of
N:times (as in the movie).
