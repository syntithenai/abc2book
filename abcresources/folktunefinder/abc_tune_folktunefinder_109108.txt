W:"Since the times have grown harder, I've a mind to leave home
W:Since the times have growed harder, my plow, drag and cart,
W:I will go to Wisconsin, some comfort to view,
W:I will double my fortune like other folks do,
W:While here we must labor each day in the field,
W:The winter destroys all the summer can yield."
W:
W:"Oh husband, I've took with a sorrowful heart
W:Long time you've neglected your plow, drag and cart;
W:Your sheep are disordered [and] the land they run on,
W:And your new Sunday jacket goes everyday on.
W:Stick to your farm, and you'll suffer no loss,
W:[For] the stone that goes rolling will gather no moss. "
W:
W:"Oh wife, let us go; don't let us stand,
W:I'll buy a farm all clear to my hand."
W:"Husband, remember the land is to clear,
W:'Twill cost you the labor of many long year;
W:There you might labor each day in the field,
W:And the winter will consume all the summer will yield.
W:
W:Stick to your farm, and you'll suffer no loss,
W:[For] the stone that goes rolling will gather no moss."
W:"Wife, let us go; don't let us wait,
W:For I long to be there, and I long to be great.
W:You may be a rich lady, and who know but I
W:Might be a great Governor ere long,'fore I die."
W:
W:"Husband, remember the land of delight,
W:'Tis surrounded by Indians and it's p'undered by night;
W:Your house may be plundered and burnt to the ground,
W:And your wife and your children lays mangled around:
W:Stick to your farm, and you'll suffer no loss,
W:The stone that goes rolling will gather no moss."
W:
W:"Oh wife  you've convinced me; I'll argue no more,
W:I never once thought of your dying before.
W:I love my dear children, although they are small,
W:It is you  my dear wife, I love better than all.
W:I'll stay on the farm, and I'll suffer the loss,
W:For the stone that goes rolling will gather no moss."
