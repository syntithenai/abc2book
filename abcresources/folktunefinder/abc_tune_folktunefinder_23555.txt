W:Johnnie rose on a May morning
W:Called for water tae wash his hands
W:Says, "Gae loose tae me my guid grey dogs
W:That lie bound in iron bands
W:
W:"Ye'll busk, ye'll busk, my noble dogs
W:Ye'll busk and make them bound
W:For I'm gaun tae the Broadspear Hill
W:Tae ding the dun deer doon"
W:
W:When Johnnie's mother she heard o' this
W:Her hands wi' dule she rung
W:Says, "Johnnie for my benison
W:Tae the green woods dinna gang
W:
W:"Enough ye hae o' the guid white breid
W:Enough o' the blude red wine
W:So Johnnie, for your venison
W:Tae the green woods dinna gang"
W:
W:But Johnnie has buskit up his guid bent bow
W:His arrows ane by ane
W:And he's awa' tae Durisdeer
W:Tae ding the dun deer doon
W:
W:Johnnie shot, the dun deer lap
W:And he wounded her in the side
W:But atween the water and the wood
W:His hounds they laid her pride
W:
W:Johnnie ate o' the venison
W:His dogs drank o' the blude
W:Till they a' lay doon and fell asleep
W:Asleep as they'd been deid
W:
W:The by there cam' a silly auld carle
W:A silly auld man was he
W:And he's awa' tae the king's foresters
W:Tae tell wha' he did see
W:
W:Then up an' spak' the king's forester
W:An angry man was he
W:"If this be Johnnie o' Braidesley
W:We soon will gar him dee"
W:
W:"Stand stout, stand stout, my noble dogs
W:Stand stout and dinna flee
W:Stand fast, stand fast, my guid grey hounds
W:And we wi' mak' them dee"
W:
W:Johnnie he shot six o' them
W:He's wounded the seventh sair
W:Syne he swung his hough ower his horse's back
W:And he swore he would hunt mair
W:
W:Now Johnnie's guid bent bow is brak'
W:His guid grey dogs are slain
W:And his body lies in Durisdeer
W:His hunting days are done
