W:When I was apprenticed in London, I went to see my dear
W:The candles all were burning, the moon shone bright and clear
W:I knocked upon her window to ease her out of her pain
W:She rose up to let me in, then barred the door again
W:
W:I like well your behavior and this I often say
W:I cannot rest contented when I am far away
W:The roads they are so muddy, we cannot walk about
W:So roll me in your arms, Love, and blow the candles out
W:
W:Your father and your mother in yonder room do lie
W:A-hugging one another, so why not you and I
W:A-hugging one another, without a fear or doubt
W:So roll me in your arms, Love, and blow the candles out
W:
W:I pray thee speak more softly of what we have to do
W:Lest that our noise of talking should make our pleasure rue
W:The streets they are so nigh, Love, the people walk about
W:They may peep in and spy, Love, so blow the candles out
W:
W:And if we prove successful, Love, please name it after me
W:Treat it neat and kiss it sweet and daft it on your knee
W:When my three years are over, my time it will be out
W:And I will pay my debt to you by blowing the candles out
