N:Who can forget the impassioned speech of 
N:O'Killigan in O'Casey's Purple Dust, 
N:especially when he sets out to 
N:woo Avril away from her British lord. 
N:O'Killigan has only the simple 
N:things in his favor. But Avril finally 
N:succumbs to his grand talk as 
N:he urges her "to spit out what's here" 
N:and make a home with him out 
N:in the west of Ireland where they'll 
N:both find "things to say and 
N:things to do, and love at the endings."
