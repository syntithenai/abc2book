H:One of the verses in "The Milkemaid's Life" describes an 18th century
H:May Day custom in which the milkmaids and the sweeps dance in the
H:street with a garland.
W:Upon the first of May, with garlands fresh and gay
W:With mirth and
W:music sweet, for such a season meet
W:They pass their time

W:They nimbly their feet to ply
W:And bravely try the
W:victory
W:In honour o' th' milking pail, in honour ...
