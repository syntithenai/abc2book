%
% "The Four Hand Reel" as far as the writer is aware was first brought
% to Chicago in 1886 by Barney Delaney, an excellent Irish piper. So
% versatile was he, like most great Irish musicians, in the manipulation
% of his instrument, that he varied his tunes according to fancy
% without detriment to tone or rhythm, but rather to the advantage of
% the general effect. Although not included in any collection of Irish
% music published beyond the Atlantic, the strain must have been quite
% popular in the Eastern States, for we find the tune in a Boston=20
% publication no less than four times, and named respectively:
% "Corporal Casey's Favorite", "Lady Gardner's Reel", "Parnell's Reel",
% and "Yellow-Haired Laddie"; all consisting of but two parts each.
% The setting here presented was memorized from Delaney's playing,
% but no bare scoring of measured bars could do justice to his
% inimitable execution.
% Since the foregoing was written I find that "The Five Mile Chase"
% in R.M. Levey's Second Collection of the Dance Music of Ireland,
% London, 1873; consisting of but two parts, is also a variant of=20
