% This fine old march was memorized from the
% playing of William McLean a famous Highland
% piper much admired in Chicago some fifty years ago.
% The tune in almost identical setting was included in
% a book of pipe music, published at Glasgow about
% 1825 under two names: "The Duke of Athol's
% March" and a long Gaelic title expressive of romance
% and chivalry. Its spirited swing and characteristic
% cadences, no less than its Gaelic title indicate an
% Irish origin.
