W:Well met, well met, my own true love
W:Well met, well met, cried he
W:I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
W:And it's all for the love of thee
W:
W:O I could have married the king's daughter dear
W:And she would have married me
W:But I have refused the crown of gold
W:And it's all for the sake of thee
W:
W:If you could have married the king's daughter dear
W:I'm sure you are to blame
W:For I am married to the house carpenter
W:And he is a fine young man
W:
W:If you'll forsake your house carpenter
W:And come away with me
W:I'll take you to where the grass grows green
W:On the banks of the sweet Willie
W:
W:If I forsake my house carpenter
W:And come away with thee
W:What have you got to maintain me upon
W:And keep me from slavery
W:
W:I've six ships sailing on the salt, salt sea
W:A-sailing from dry land
W:And a hundred and twenty jolly young men
W:Shall be at thy command
W:
W:She picked up her poor wee babe
W:And kisses gave him three
W:Saying stay right here with the house carpenter
W:And keep him good company
W:
W:They had not been at sea two weeks
W:I'm sure it was not three
W:When this poor maid began to weep
W:And she wept most bitterly
W:
W:O do you weep for your gold, he said
W:Your houses, your land, or your store
W:Or do you weep for your house carpenter
W:That you never shall see anymore
W:
W:I do not weep for my gold, she said
W:My houses, my land or my store
W:But I do weep for my poor wee babe
W:That I never shall see anymore
W:
W:They had not been at sea three weeks
W:I'm sure it was not four
W:When in their ship there sprang a leak
W:And she sank to rise no more
W:
W:What hills, what hills are those, my love
W:That are so bright and free
W:Those are the hill of Heaven, my love
W:But not for you and me
W:
W:What hills, what hills, are those, my love
W:That are so dark and low
W:Those are the hills of Hell, my love
W:Where you and I must go
