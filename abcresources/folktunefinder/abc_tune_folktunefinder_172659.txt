T:Loch Na Garr
R:song air
H:Byron's "Loch na Garr" was often sung by the Limerick people to the
H:following slow Irish air, which may be compared with "The Bunch of Green
H:Rushes that Grew At the Brim" (Moore's "This life is all chequered").
N:  [Here are the words to Byron's poem, typed in by your editor Earendil]

L:1/8
W:    Ah! There my young footsteps in infancy wander'd;
W:    My cap was the bonnet, my cloak was the plaid;
W:    On chieftans long perish'd, my memeory ponder'd
W:    As daily I strode through the pine cover'd glade,
W:    I sought not my home till the day's dying glory
W:    Gave place to the rays of the bright polar star;
W:    For fancy was cheered by tradional story,
W:    Disclosed by the natives of dark Loch na Garr
W: 
W:    Years have rolled on, Loch na Garr, since I left you,
W:    Years must elapse ere I tread you again;
W:    Nature of verdure and flow'rs has bereft you
W:    Yet still you are dearer than Albions plain.
W:    England, thy beauties are tame and domestic
W:    To one who roved o'er the mountains afar;
W:    Oh for the crags that are wild and majestic!
W:    The steep frowning glories of dark Loch na Garr.
