N:Tom came from somewhere in the Monaghan
N:Hills-no one knew exactly where. He loved to ceili and "pack it in"
N:Tom had a "shakey" hand that could have been a trial to most. But you
N:would never know it from the way Tom could slap large cuts of butter
N:on his bread at tea time. Mom Reavy said Tom's hand was not to be
N:pitied
N:"for it always shook deeper into the butter."
