N:Ed wanted one of his tunes to commemorate 
N:this favorite poem of his. He didn't know 
N:much Yeats, but what he knew
N:he appreciated-particularly 
N:the last verse of "the Swans"
N:But now they drift on the still water, 
N:Mysterious, beautiful; 
N:Among what rushes will they build, 
N:By what lake's edge or pool, 
N:Delight men's eyes when I awake someday, 
N:To find they have flown away.
Z:Joe Reavy
