N:Ed was to a fair once in Rosslea and heard
N:this whistler. He had a
N:whistling range that could
N:easily match the register
N:of a fiddle or flute. And he had
N:all the embellishments of a great
N:traditional player, too. He sold fish
N:in the market places and charmed
N:his customers with choice
N:tunes-many of his own making.
