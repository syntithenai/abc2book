N:The Bog of Allen. Mentioned eloquently in Joyce's 
N:short story, "The Dead" (in Dubliners). This 
N:desolate region reminds us of Yeats' line 
N:"the drifting, indefinite bitterness of life" 
N:Ed has always felt that far too much is made 
N:of Ireland's greenery and not enough said 
N:of her terrible greyness. Ed has lived to 
N:see the whole of Ireland, and he has tried 
N:to get as much of it as he could into his own tunes.
