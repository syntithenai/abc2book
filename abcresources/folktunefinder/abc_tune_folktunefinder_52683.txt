T:The Bellbird Sings in the Cunt of Death
Z:Jack Campin <http://www.campin.me.uk/>
C:Jack Campin
N:This is basically the New Zealand national anthem speeded up and
N:in a different metre and mode.  I was experimenting with perverse
N:variations on it: this Playford-like jig emerged.  So it needed a
N:suitably anti-patriotic title.
N:The reference is to the legend of the Maori hero Maui, who tried to
N:destroy death.  He borrowed his grandmother's jawbone to use as a
N:club, and led an army of all the birds of the forest up the vagina
N:of Hine Nui o Te Po (The Great Lady of the Void, the goddess of death)
N:to kill her while she was sleeping.  Maui told all the birds to keep
N:quiet so as not to wake her, but the bellbird couldn't stop himself
N:letting out a tweet.  Hine Nui o Te Po awoke and crushed Maui with her
N:cunt muscles.
