N:Johnny McGoohan's. Good musicians need 
N:good listeners, and two 
N:of the best listeners where Johnny 
N:and his wife Katey. Johnny would 
N:be waiting on his front porch 
N:hours before "the fellows" were 
N:expected on an evening for a 
N:session of music; and no matter how 
N:long they played, it was never too 
N:late for a few more tunes at 
N:the McGoohans. Tea and skohn did not 
N:mean (as it usually does) that 
N:the fiddling would stop. As Johnny 
N:would put it, "We'll have a bite 
N:to eat and be back at it for a few more 
N:before the night is done." 
N:And Katey would never disagree.
