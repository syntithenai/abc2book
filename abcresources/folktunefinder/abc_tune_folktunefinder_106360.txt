% Dings A' " was printed in Neil Stewart's A Collection of the Newest
% and the Best Reels, or Country Dances, Adapted for the Violin or
% German Flute, Edinburgh 1761-62. Dunse is a town in the Lowlands,
% a few miles from the English border gave name to several tunes.
% "Dunse Dings A' " signifies in plain English "Dunse surpasses or
% excels all, an exaggerated yet pardonable expression of local pride.
