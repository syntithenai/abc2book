W:I climb the mountain and scan the ocean
W:For thee, my boatman, with fond devotion
W:When shall I see thee today tomorrow
W:Oh! do not leave me in lonely sorrow.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  O, my boatman, na horo aila,  (3x)
W:  May joy await thee where'er thou sailest.
W:
W:Broken-hearted, I droop and languish,
W:And frequent tears show mg bosom's anguish;
W:Shall I expect thee tonight to cheer me
W:Or close the door, sighing, sad and weary.
W:
W:From passing boatmen I'd fain discover
W:If they have heard of or seen my lover;
W:They never tell me - I'm only chided,
W:And told my heart has been sore misguided
W:
W:My lover promised to bring his lady
W:A silken gown and a tartan plaidie,
W:A ring of gold which would show his semblance
W:But, ah! I fear me for his remembrance.
W:
W:That thou'rt a rover my friends have told me,
W:But not the less to my heart I hold thee;
W:And every night in my dream I see thee,
W:And still at dawn will the visions flee me.
W:
W:I may not hide it - my heart's devotion
W:Is not a season's brief emotion;
W:Thy love in childhood began to seize me
W:And ne'er shall fade until death release me.
W:
W:My friends oft tell me that I must sever
W:All thoughts of thee from my heart forever;
W:Their words are idle - my passions, swelling,
W:Untamed as ocean, can brook no quelling.
W:
W:My heart is weary with ceaseless wailing,
W:Like wounded swan when her strength is failing
W:Her notes of anguish the lake awaken,
W:By all her comrades at last forsaken.
