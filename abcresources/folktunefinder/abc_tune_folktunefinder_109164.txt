W:I sing of a Whistle, a Whistle of worth,
W:I sing of' a Whistle, the pride of the North,
W:Was brought to the court of our good Scottish king,
W:And long with this Whistle all Scotland shall ring.
W:
W:Old Loda*, still rueing the arm of Fingal,
W:The god of the bottle sends down from his hall-
W:'This Whistle's your challenge, to Scotland get o'er,
W:'And drink them to hell, Sir! or ne'er see me more!'
W:
W:Old poets have sung, and old chronicles tell,
W:What champions ventured, what champions fell;
W:The son of great Loda was conqueror still,
W:And blew on the Whistle their requiem shrill.
W:
W:Till Robert, the lord of the Cairn and the Scaur,
W:Unmatched at the bottle, unconquered in war,
W:He drank his poor god-ship as deep as the sea,
W:No tide of the Baltic e'er drunker than he.
W:
W:Thus Robert, victorious, the trophy has gained,
W:Which now in his house has for ages remained;
W:Till three noble chieftains, and all of his blood,
W:The jovial contest again have renewed.
W:
W:Three joyous good fellows with hearts clear of flaw;
W:Craigdarroch so famous for wit, worth, and law;
W:And trusty Glenriddel, so skilled in old coins;
W:And gallant Sir Robert, deep-read in old wines.
W:
W:Craigdarroch began with a tongue smooth as oil,
W:Desiring Glenriddel to yield up the spoil;
W:Or else he would muster the heads of the clan,
W:And once more, in claret, try which was the man.
W:
W:'By the gods of the ancients!'Glenriddel replies,
W:'Before I surrender so glorious a prize,
W:'I,ll conjure the ghost of the great Rorie More*,
W:'And bumoer his horn with him twenty times o'er.'
W:
W:A bard was selected to witness the fray,
W:And tell future ages the feats of the day;
W:A bard who detested all sadness and spleen,
W:And wished that Pamassus a vineyard had been.
W:
W:The dinner being over, the claret they ply,
W:And every new cork is a new spring of joy;
W:In the bands of old friends    and kindred so set,
W:And the bands grew the tighter the more they were wet.
W:
W:Gay Pleasure ran riot as bumpers ran o'er;
W:Bright Phoebus ne'er witnessed so joyous a corps,
W:And vowed that to leave them he was quite forlorn,
W:Till Cynthia hinted he'd see them next morn.
W:
W:Six bottles a-piece had well wore out the night,
W:When gallant Sir Robert, to finish the fight,
W:Turned o'er in one bumper a bottle of red,
W:And swore 'twas the way that their ancestor did.
W:
W:Then worthy Glernriddel, so cautious and sage,
W:No longer the warfare, ungodly, would wage;
W:A high ruling elder to wallow in wine!
W:He left the foul business to folks less divine.
W:
W:The gallant Sir Robert fought hard to the end;
W:But who can with Fate and Quart Bumpers contend
W:Though Fate said, a hero should perish in light;
W:So uprose bright Phoebus - and down fell the kinght.
W:
W:Next uprose our Bard, like a prophet in drink:-
W:'Craigdarroch, thou'lt soar when creation shall sink!
W:'But if thou would flourish immortal in rhyme,
W:'Come -one bottle more- and have at the sublime !
W:
W:'Thy line, that have struggled for freedom with Bruce
W:'Shall heroes and patriots ever produce:
W:'So thine be the laurel, and mine be the bay
W:'The field thou hast won, by yon bright god of day!'
