R:Reel
N:Is one of the landed names of 
N:Cavan and of old Brefni before it. The 
N:O'Reillys have spread far and wide to wherever the
N:immigrant has ventured in his many meanderings. 
N:This title could well be our
N:proud county's battlecry, or the triumphant 
N:chant of a Cavan footballer
N:scoring a winning goal at Croake Park.
