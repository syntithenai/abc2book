B:A Breeze Through the CONduit, (c) 1992 by Julia West
N:About this one, Cat says, "This phrase kept cropping up in the books I
N:was reading.  I'd never seen it before--and that doesn't happen to me
N:very much nowadays.  It means extra-specially mad, as in 'So-and-so is
N:mad in white linen.'  I thought, 'Gee, that's a very evocative
N:phrase.'"
D:on the tape, "A Breeze Through the CONduit"
W:She's mad in white linen, her form fairly glows,
W:Clad in her shift, down the hallways she goes
W:Singing, she laughs through the tears that she cries,
W:Staring right through you with unseeing eyes.
W:Those eyes hold a grief that no joy can dispell.
W:They saw her babes slaughtered when Highcastle fell.
W:Their murderer, seeking a throne in the strife,
W:He took him the woman he'd widowed to wife.
