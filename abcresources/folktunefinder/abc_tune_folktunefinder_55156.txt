W:On Monday morning I married a wife,
W:Thinking to live and a sober life,
W:But as she turned out, I'd better been dead,
W:The remarkable day that I was wed,
W:To me rite fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Tuesday morning I goes to the wood,
W:I cut a stick both fine and good,
W:The finest stick that ever you did see,
W:I cut him out of a holly holly tree,
W:To me rite  fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Wednesday morning then home goes I,
W:Thinking a battle I must try.
W:I beat him about her back and her wig,
W:Until I'd a-broke me holly, holly twig,
W:To me rite fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Thursday morning my poor wife,
W:She was sick and like to die,
W:If she isn't better tomorrow, you see,
W:The devil may have her for all of me,
W:To me rite fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Friday morning the sun did shine,
W:And I walked out in the midst of my prime,
W:Oh, the devil he come in, in the mudst of the game,
W:And he took her away, both blind and lame,
W:To me rite fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Saturday morning it's five days past
W:My poor wife is dead at last
W:The big bell shall ring and the little one shall toll
W:And I'll go home like a jolly old soul,
W:To me rite fol-lol-liddle-lol-le-day.
W:
W:On Sunday morning I dined without
W:I had ne'er a wife to scold me about
W:Here's good luck to my pipe, my bottle and my friend
W:And here's good luck to a week's work end.
