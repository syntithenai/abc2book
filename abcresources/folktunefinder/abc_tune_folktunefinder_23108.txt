W:Ah, it's likely gone six months ago
W:I came to Dublin town,
W:Where I joined a gang of lab'ring men
W:Who laid the ashpalt down;
W:Sure, now I wear a guernsey
W:And around me waist a belt
W:I'm the gaffer of the boys that
W:Make the hot ashpalt.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Well we laid it in the hollow
W:  and we laid it on the flat
W:  And if it doesn't last forever
W:  Well, I'll shurely eat me hat
W:  Ah, but now I wear a guernsey
W:  And around me waist a belt
W:  I'm the gaffer of the lads
W:  That lay the hot asphalt
W:
W:Well one day a copper comes up to me
W:And he says to me, "'McGuire,
W:Will you kindly let me warm myself,
W:Around your boilin' fire"
W:Then he turned around to the boiler,
W:And upon the edge he knelt,
W:And he toppled right into the boiler
W:Full of hot ashpalt.
W:
W:Well we quickly pulled him out of it
W:And we put him in a tub,
W:And with soap and lots of heated water
W:We did rub and scrub.
W:But the divil a bit of tar came off,
W:It was stuck on just like stone,
W:And every time we gave a rub
W:You could hear the poor man groan.
W:
W:With the boilin' and the wettin',
W:He caught a bloomin' cold,
W:And for scientific purposes
W:His body has been sold.
W:Inside the National Museum now
W:He's a-hanging by the belt,
W:As an example of the dire effects
W:Of the hot ashpalt.
