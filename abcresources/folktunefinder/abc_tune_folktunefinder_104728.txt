N:CGP.I have difficulty quite often in assigning a "Rhythm" to a tune,
N:and they end up as "miscellaneous" as in this case. The problem here is
N:that the tune is not used for a jig or a quadrille dance nowadays (if
N:ever) but is very strongly associated with the dance "Nottingham
N:Swing",a hop-step dance usually done to Schottisches or Spotty
N:Hornpipes eg Keel Row, Nae guid Luck(!a 6/8 tune).
