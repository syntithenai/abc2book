N:From Bill Black (Zouki):
N:The NY area fiddler/composer/teacher Pete Kelly told us that he had
N:composed this tune years ago for his student ceili band "The Shannonaires".
N:He was vague about the name, leading me to believe that (1) it never had
N:one, or (2) Pete didn't remember what it was.
N:
N:Pete is a very respected individual who (as far as I can tell) would not have
N:made a claim to authorship lightly. I know there are those who are skeptical
N:about his claim, but no one has ever brought forth evidence to show that it's
N:not correct.
N:
N:In the event, "Pete Kelly's" or "The Shannonaires" would probably be more
N:accurate names than those already supplied.
