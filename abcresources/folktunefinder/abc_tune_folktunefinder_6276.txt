N:Appears to be a combination of two James Scott Skinner tunes:
N:"The Baker" and "The Ten Pound Fiddle" (thus the silly name, for want
N:of a better).
Z:Larry Sanger from a tape of a tape of a tape...of John Doherty.  He
Z:just played it twice through, so this is more or less what he played.
Z:The second and fourth parts below are identical; it might just be a
Z:two-part reel with the second time through being a variation, but it
Z:sounds good as a four-part reel too.  Yes, he played the second and
Z:fourth parts for sixteen bars, the first and third parts for eight
Z:bars.
