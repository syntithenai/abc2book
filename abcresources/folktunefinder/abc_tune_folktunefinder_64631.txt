N:I have Edited this tune somewhat to make it add up and playABC. Most of
N:the beams are my additions, to make it read easier.Where the note
N:lengths have been changed, refer to the uneditted version. One note
N:only has been missed out, at the start of the B strain, otherwise
N:everything else has
N:been accomodated by tweeking the note lengths.Obviously NOT copied from
N:a printed source! Chris P.
