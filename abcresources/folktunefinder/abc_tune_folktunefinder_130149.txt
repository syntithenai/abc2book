H:These three flings take their titles from the townland of Drumbeggan. The mile-long concrete lane below our house leads In the Lane to Carran passing a large circle of trees known locally as The Fairy Fort and ending at The Poet's House (Peadar Burns) overlooking the lakes of Carran and Ross and the surrounding Boho countryside. A truly inspirational part of Fermanagh.
