W:I mounted on horseback with five miles to ride
W:Till I came to a cottage near Kellswaterside
W:Said I to myself, in this country might be
W:A maid young and handsome and she might fit me.
W:
W:I dismounted my horse and went in and sat down;
W:A maid in the corner I viewed all around,
W:Her cheeks blushed like roses,  her curved lips were red,
W:And her eyes were like diamonds that shone in her head.
W:
W:'O,'  said I, 'my wee lassie, will you come wi' me
W:To the sweet town of Antrim, where married we'll be
W:In the sweet town of Antrim we'll  get the words said,
W:And you ne'er will return to your mother a maid
W:
W:'Your offer is good, sir, I cannot deny,
W:But to make your acquaintance I ne'er will comply
W:To go with a stranger would grudge me in mind
W:At leaving Kellswater and sweethearts behind.
W:
W:'My friends and my parents would all on me frown
W:At leaving Kellswater and fair Randalstown.'
W:'Your friends and your parents will not on you frown
W:For leaving Kellswater and fair Randalstown.
W:
W:'For in sweet Ballybogey, where I will you bring,
W:You'll hear the birds whistle and nightingales sing;
W:Your heart will be glad and no tears need you weep,
W:And the birds in the evening will sing you to sleep.'
W:
W:'Come back, my wee laddie, I'm changing my mind,
W:And now to get married my heart feels inclined
W:I bid my old sweethearts a last fond adieu,
W:And I'll leave my old parents and follow with you.'
