W:
W:In the ways of true temp'rance see children delighting,
W:So joyful and happy wherever we go.
W:If firm to the purpose in which we're united,
W:WE SHALL NEVER BE DRUNKARDS, Oh NEVER, OH NO!
W:
W:CH:  Oh NEVER, oh never, OH NEVER, Oh never,
W:     WE SHALL NEVER BE DRUNKARDS, Oh NEVER, OH NO!
W:
W:The first little drop of strong drink that is taken,
W:Is the first step to ruin: e'en children may know,
W:If the first little drop be in earnest forsaken,
W:WE SHALL NEVER BE DRUNKARDS, OH NEVER, OH NO!
W:
W:Then free from the ruin strong drink would occasion,
W:WE'LL STAND BY OUR TEMPERANCE WHEREVER WE GO!
W:And if bad men should tempt, we'll resist their persuasion,
W:AND NEVER BE DRUNKARDS - OH NEVER, OH NO!
