W:As I went out one morning early,
W:To breathe the sweet and pleasant air,
W:Who should I spy but a fair young maiden;
W:She seemed to me like a lily fair.
W:
W:I stepped to her add kindly asked her,
W:"Would you like to be a bold sailor's wife"
W:"Oh no kind sir," she quickly answered,
W:"I choose to lead a sweet single life."
W:
W:"What makes you different from other women
W:What makes you different from other kind
W:For you are young, sweet, beautiful and handsome,
W:And for to marry you, I might incline."
W:
W:"It's now kind sir that I must tell you.
W:I might have been married three years ago
W:To one John Riley who left this country.
W:He's been the cause of my overthrow."
W:
W:"He courted me both late and early.
W:He courted me both night and day.
W:And when he had once my affections gained,
W:He left me here and he went away."
W:
W:"Oh never mind for this Johnny Riley,
W:Oh come with me to the distant shore.
W:Why, we'll sail o'er to Pennsylvany,
W:And bid adieu to Riley forever more."
W:
W:"I shan't go with you to Pennsylvany,
W:Or go with you to the distant shore.
W:My heart is with Riley, my long lost lover
W:Although I'll never see him no more."
W:
W:Oh, when he saw that her love was loyal,
W:He gave her kisses one, two, and three,
W:Saying, "I'm the man you once called Johnny Riley,
W:Saying "I'm the cause of your misery."
W:
W:"I've sailed the ocean, gained great promotion,
W:I've laid my money on the English shore,
W:And now we'll marry, no longer tarry,
W:And I shall never deceive you any more."
