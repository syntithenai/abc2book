W: Every morning as true as the clock, somebody hears the postman's knock. (2x)
W:
W:What a wonderful man the postman is as he hastens from door to door!  What
W:medley of news his hands contain for either rich or poor!  In
W:many a face he joy can trace, as many a grief he can see, but the
W:door is open to his loud tap-tap and his swift delivery.
W:
W:Number one he presents with news of a birth, with tidings of death number 4, at
W:13 a bill of terrible length he drops through a hole in the door; Now a
W:check or an order for 15 he brings, for 16 his presence to prove, for
W:17 doth an acknowledgement get, and 18 a letter of love.
