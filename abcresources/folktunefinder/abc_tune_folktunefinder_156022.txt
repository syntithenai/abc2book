W: "m" = mordant, (i.e., a one finger-flick"trill" upwards)
W: Harmony notes were just soft touches, these are only examples of possible uses.

W:Notes:  The rhythm for Elverumspols is VERY similar to that of  Telespringar.  One
W: is long, two is just a tiny bit shorter, three is about half of two.  Accenting  is heavy
W: one, heaviest two, heavy three.  (ie, it's bouncy.)
W:
W: Note that an 1/8 note within beat 3 is just barely longer than a 16th note within
W: beat 2 (or ~ the same length,depending on the tune & phrase.)  These pols forms
W: were written with a time signature of 2&1/2 by early collectors for good reason.
W:
W: Elverumspols are only played once.  The tag is used by the dancers to thank each
W: other.  Then they promenade,waiting for the next tune.  In Elverum, of course,
W: most of the evening's dances would be Elverum's pols.  Here, we usually play at
W: least 3 in a row to make up the equivalent of 1 dance on the dance program.
