N: As written the last note in bar 15 was preceded by a
N: "natural" sign inside a pair of parentheses (i.e. (=)e ).
N: I have interpreted this as an "e natural" grace note follwed
N: by an "e sharp".
N: Similarly the first note(in bar 17) was immediately preceded
N: by a sharp inside a pair of parentheses ( (#)f ).
N: Again I have interpreted this to as an f# grace note
N: followed by the note "f".
