% This fine composition is attributed to Carolan in Bunting's General
% Collection of the Ancient Irish Music, Dublin 1796; Hardiman's Irish
% Minstrelsy, London 1831; and Clinton's Gems of Ireland, London 1841.
% Grattan Flood, an eminent authority, states in his A History of Irish
% Music, Dublin 1905, that this "glorious lament was composed on the
% death of Owen Roe O'Neill in 1649", a date preceding Carolan's birth
% by twenty-one years. Owen Roe O'Neill, prince of Ulster, was a
% gallant military leader who vanquished the British forces at the
% battle of Benburb in 1646.
