R:Reel
N:Reilly had a wild look and a fondness for
N:cheating at cards. Before the night was finished you could bet your
N:last skin of a potato that Reilly would be stirring up trouble. No one
N:knew his first name. He was one of the "White Hill people" from a
N:region beyond the northern borders of Ed's farmland.
