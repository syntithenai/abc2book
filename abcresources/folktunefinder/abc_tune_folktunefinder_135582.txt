C: Bob McQuillen 24 Aug 92
B: Bob's Note Book 9 # 65
N: waltz
N: If a tune gets written in France, does that make it a French Tune I dunno,
N: but  this  tune a ppeared in Scotland last summer (writing this in Feb '93)
N: when Sarah Bauhan and Leaf Seligmann and I were over there on vacation.  So
N: perhaps it's a Scottish Tune.  You can decide that one. Anyway, it's Leaf's
N: waltz, no matter what, and it comes to her with love from her friend Mac.
