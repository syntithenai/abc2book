W: Unite and unite and let us all unite
W: For summer is a-come unto day
W: And whither we are going, we will all unite
W: In the merry morning of May
W:
W: With a merry ring and
W: Now the joyful spring
W: O give us a cup of ale
W: And the merrier we will sing
W:
W: The young men of Padstow,
W: They might if they would
W: They might have built a ship
W: And gilded it all in gold
W:
W: The young women of Padstow,
W: They might if they would
W: They might have built a garland
W: Of the white rose and the red 
W:
W: Where are those young men
W: That now here should dance
W: For some they are in England
W: And some they are in France
W:
W: O where is St. George
W: O where is he o 
W: He's out in his longboat
W: All on the salt sea-o
W:
W: Up flies the kite
W: Down falls the lark-o
W: And Ursula Birdhood, she had an old ewe
W: And she died in her own park-o
W:
W: With a merry ring
W: And now the joyful spring
W: So happy are those little birds
W: And the merrier we will sing
