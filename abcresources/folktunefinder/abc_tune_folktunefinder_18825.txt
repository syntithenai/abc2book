W:Chorus:
W:  So fare thee well, my own true love
W:    When I return united we will be 
W:  It's not the leaving of Liverpool that's grieving me
W:    But my darling when I think of thee 
W: 
W:1.Oh the sun is on the harbour, love And I wish I could remain 
W: For I know it will be a long, long time Till I see you again 
W:     == Chorus ==
W: 
W:2.I'm bound off for California By the way of stormy Cape Horn 
W: And I'm bound to write you a letter, love When I am homeward bound 
W:     == Chorus == 
W: 
W:3.Farewell to Prince's Landing Stage River Mersey, fare thee well 
W: I am bound for California A place I know right well 
W:     == Chorus == 
W: 
W:4.I have signed on a Yankee Clipper ship Davy Crockett is her name 
W: And Burgess is the Captain of her And they say she's a floating Hell 
W:     == Chorus == 
W: 
W:5.I have shipped with Burgess once before And I think I know him well 
W: If a man's a seaman, he can get along If not, then he's sure in Hell 
W:     == Chorus == 
W: 
W:6.Farewell to lower Frederick Street Ensign Terrace and Park Lane 
W: For I think it will be a long, long time Before I see you again 
W:     == Chorus ==
