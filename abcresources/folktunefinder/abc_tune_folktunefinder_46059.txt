W:Come, all ye human countrymen, with pity lend an ear,
W:And hear my feeling story; you can't but shed a tear.
W:I'm held in close confinement and bound in irons strong,
W:Surrounded by stony granite walls and sentenced to be hung.
W:
W:Charles Gustavus Anderson is my right and proper name;
W:Since I have been in custody I ne'er denied the same.
W:I came from decent parents although I die in scorn,
W:And believe me now I much lament that ever I was born.
W:
W:It was my sad misfortune that brought me to this place,
W:To die an ignominious death, my parents to disgrace.
W:With sorrow  when I parted them, their hearts were pierced thro',
W:Their sorrows were not worn away before they will renew.
W:
W:My father was a shipwright, I might have been the same,
W:He taught me good examples, to him I leave no blame.
W:Likewise my tender mother, who for me suffered sore,
W:When she hears this sad announcement I'm sure she'll suffer more.
W:
W:O dear and loving mother, If I could but see your face,
W:I'd kiss thy lips of tenderness, and take my last embrace
W:I'd bathe you in my tears of grief before my final hour,
W:I'd then submit myself to God, to His holy will and power.
W:
W:Brothers and sisters all, adieu, who are near and dear to me,
W:So far beyond the ocean, whose faces I ne'er shall see.
W:The happy days I spent with you on my native shore,
W:Farewell, sweet Udavilla, I will never see you more.
W:
W:Ah, if I could recall my days again, how happy I would be,
W:To live at home amongst my friends, in love and unity.
W:When I think of former innocence, and those I left behind,
W:'Tis God and only Him that knows the horrors of my mind.
W:
W:No books of consolation are here that I can read,
W:I profess the Church of England, by nation I'm a Swede.
W:Those words that are addressed to me, I can't well understand,
W:I must die like a heathen here in a foreign land.
W:
W:It's near the town of Gottenborg where I was bred and born,
W:Here in the city of Halifax I end my life in scorn;
W:Pity my misfortunes and a warning take from me,
W:Shun all evil company and beware of mutiny.
W:
W:Since I left my tender parents, it's but a few years ago,
W:Of the dreadful fate that awaits me, it's little I did know.
W:I got into bad company who have seduced me,
W:For to become a murderer and a pirate on the sea.
W:
W:I shipped on board the Saladin, as you may understand,
W:She was bound to Valparaiso, McKenzie had command.
W:We arrived there in safety without the least dismay,
W:When Fielding came on board of us, curse on that fatal day.
W:
W:'Twas him that seduced us to do that horrid crime;
W:Though we might have prevented it if we had thought in time.
W:We shed the blood of innocence, the same we don't deny,
W:And stained our hands in human blood, for which we have to die.
W:
W:Oh, God, I fear Your vengeance, and judgment much I dread,
W:To stand before Your judgment-seat with my hands imbued in blood,
W:I deserve Your indignation, but Your pardon still I crave,
W:Oh, Lord, have mercy on my soul beyond the gloomy grave.
W:
W:The sheriff and his officers all came to him in gaol;
W:He knew their awful message well but never seemed to fail.
W:They placed the fatal halter on, to end all shame and strife;
W:With his own hands he greased the cord that cut the thread of life.
W:
W:He was led to the gallows and placed on that awful stand.
W:He viewed the briny ocean and then the pleasant land.
W:The rope adjusted through the ring, which quickly stopped his breath,
W:So ended his career in the violent jaws of death.
