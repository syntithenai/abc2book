You'll notice that the original version of this tune is based on ascending and descending sequnces of 4 notes that go across the barlines, joining in the middle of a group of 4 quavers, e.g. dc|BAcB AGBA|GEAG... In my version, these sequences alternate with those that join after the first quaver of a group of 4, e.g. dc|BdcB AcBA|GBAG... The basic melody isn't changed, but that variation makes the rhythm slightly more syncopated, and it does nice things to the B-part. I've also omitted the double stops from both parts, and put my own twist on some other bits as well.
