%
% Few tunes are more widely known than "The Girl I Left Behind Me",
% or "The Spalpeen Fanach", as an air, march, or hornpipe. Even so,
% no apology is needed for the introduction of this elaborate setting
% with variations by Jeremiah Breen, a famous blind fiddler of North
% Kerry of the past generation. His tunes noted down by a pupil,
% Thomas Rice, were transcribed by a friend Sergt. James P. Walsh
% of the Chicago Police.
