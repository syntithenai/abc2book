N:"Old Pat Kane" was a Wexford man who worked on a rich man's
N:estate in the Philadelphia suburbs. Ed visited Pat and his wife
N:in the early seventies, a year or so after his visit to Ireland.
N:Pat worked the farm much as he did in the Old Country and he had
N:great flavor in his language. He liked his bottle of "Porther,"
N:whenever he could get it. He often exclaimed that man needed
N:nothing else to sustain himself in this life. "It is more
N:than a drink," he was heard to say-"it's both meat and dhrink."
