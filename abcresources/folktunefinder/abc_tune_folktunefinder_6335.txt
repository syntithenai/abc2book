N: Maurice came to our session last night and I asked him  where  he  got  the
N: tune  from  (from where he got the tune, if you insist).  He said he got it
N: from his"master" (first music teacher) Johnny  Linehan,  and  that  Linehan
N: called it "The Drunken Peeler".  Maurice regards it as a very old tune.
