%N:We learned this waltz from Jon Singleton and Chris Roe in Seattle, the day
%N:after it was played at the funeral of John Denyes, a well-loved musician
%N:and dancer.  This was his favorite tune and so it has special significance
%N:for all of us who knew him.  This version, folk-processed into the key of
%N:G with simplified harmonies, is popular both in Seattle and in New England.
%N:You can hear a nice version of this on "My Joy," available from Hanneke
%N:Cassell at POB 231080, Boston, MA 02123.
