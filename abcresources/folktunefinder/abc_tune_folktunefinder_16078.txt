N:  For those of you who do not know John and his fiddle and  melodeon
N:  playing,  (and  for  those who do), this seems a good time to drop
N:  into the Tradtune pond a tune that he wrote for a friend.  He  was
N:  good enough to send me a recording of his playing of it, and he is
N:  happy for it to be used subject to the usual copyright conditions.
N:  Actually I put that bit in as he's not worried by copyright issues
N:  "unless the Disney Corporation try to use it".
N:
N:  John has a friend whose house has an open door onto  the  attached
N:  smallholding. The feathered captives have free access to the house
N:  and often use it for incubation and hatching  purposes.   One  day
N:  when  arriving  for  a  practice  he  met  the lodger who was just
N:  leaving.  "When you go in, watch where you tread" said the lodger,
N:  hence one of the names of the tune. There were ducks in the living
N:  room and duck poo on the floor and he "had to do  a  polka/jig  to
N:  avoid it", hence the other name. The practice continued, with John
N:  playing his fiddle with a cockerel perched on his shoulder,  "-big
N:  bugger  with  plus-fours".   Carry  these  images  with you as you
N:  contemplate the rhythm.
