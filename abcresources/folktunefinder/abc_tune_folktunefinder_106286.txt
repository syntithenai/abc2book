% A setting of this tune named "Kennedy's Jig" appears in Joyce's
% "Ancient Irish Music", Dublin 1890. Known to the fiddlers and
% pipers on this side of the Atlantic in later years as "Apples in
% Winter", it was printed under that name in the O'Neill collections,
% but no variant of the popular jig so far in circulation, displays the
% skill of that played by the versatile Billy Hanafin, proficient on
% both instruments.
% It may be pertinent to add that the Jig named "Apples in Winter"
% in O'Farrell's Collection of National Irish Music for the Union Pipes,
% London, 1797, is identical with "Gillan's Apples" in former O'Neill
% collections.
