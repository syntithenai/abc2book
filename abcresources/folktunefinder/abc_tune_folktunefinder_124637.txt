% The renowned Walter Jackson popularly known as "Piper" Jackson=20
% who flourished about the middle of the 18th Century, was reputed to
% be the composer of "Jack Lattin", "Jack O'Lattan", or "Jacky Latin",
% as the tune has been variously called. Under the first name it was
% printed in Waylet's Collection of Country Dances, 1749. As "Jack
% Laten" I find an elaborate setting of it in McGibbons Collection of
% Scots Tunes published in London 1755 consisting of four original
% parts apparently, and fifteen variations. While preserving the same
% strain, but more suitable to our purpose, O'Farrell's setting of much
% later date is here presented.
% A tune known to me as "Jenny Rock the Cradle" was declared to=20
% be "Jacky Latin" by a musical acquaintance, and it was under the=20
% latter name it was printed in O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland in=20
% 1907
% If both tunes were derived from Jackson's original composition, they
% furnish a striking illustration of how time, taste, and development=20
% diversify a strain of music in a few generations.
