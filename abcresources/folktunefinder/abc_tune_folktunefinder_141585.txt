% The above setting of which there are several variants, is no
% doubt the original. In O'Farrell's National Irish Music for the
% Union Pipes, 1797-1800, a tune named "Jerry's Rambles"
% closely follows it. More distinct variants are "The Jolly Old
% Woman" and "The Humors of Bandon", the latter as
% printed in O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland being the
% arrangement favored by modern dancers.
