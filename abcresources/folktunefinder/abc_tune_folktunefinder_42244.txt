W:My mind it being much inclined to cross the raging main,
W:I left my tender parents in sorrow, grief and pain.
W:On board the "Fame" we then became all passengers to be,
W:To sail with Captain Thompson to the Land of Libertie.
W:
W:As we were safely sailing to a place called Newfoundland,
W:The wind arose ahead of us and our ship was at a stand:
W:"All hands on deck" bold Thompson cried "Or we'll be cast away,
W:All firmly stand or you'll never land in North Amerikay".
W:
W:A mount of ice came moving down anear our gallant main,
W:But the Lord of Mercy he was kind our lives for to maintain.
W:Our gallant sailors hauled about and so our ship did save,
W:Or we were doomed to be entombed all in a watery grave.
W:
W:When we were safely landed our faint hearts we did renew,
W:But how could I sleep easy, Erin dear, so far from you.
W:I hope the time will come agi when our comrades all we'll see,
W:And once more we'll live together in love and unitie.
