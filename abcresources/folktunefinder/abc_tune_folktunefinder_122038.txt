W:This is also the tune to a song, "the man who invented the submarine" :-
W:
W:In December he was born
W:On the wild washed coast of Clare
W:Not far from the cliffs of Moher
W:That hang so high in the air.
W:The scar there stretches far away
W:From Hag's Head to Bunnin
W:But you're glad to hear of the man from Clare
W:That invented the Submarine.
W:
W:For 40 years he taught at home
W:In his dear native land,
W:Til emigrating he sailed away
W:Into a foreign land
W:Patterson, New Jersey. In work he became quite keen
W:It was there that man he formed the plan
W:and they called her the submarine.
W:(spoken) and after a while she became a most dangerous craft
W:and nearly drove the sailors half daft.
