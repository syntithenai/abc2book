W:Times were hard in Irish town; everything was going down,
W:Pat Malone was pushed for ready cash.
W:He'd the life insurance spent; all his money, too, had went
W:And all of his affairs had gone to smash.
W:His wife spoke up and said, "Now, dear Pat, if you were dead
W:This twenty thousand dollars we could take."
W:And so Pat laid down and tried to make out that he had died
W:Until he smelled the whiskey at the wake.
W:Then Pat Malone forgot that he was dead.
W:He raised himself in the bed and what he said,
W:"If this wake goes on a minute, to be sure the corpse is in it
W:You'll have to keep me drunk to keep me dead,  "
W:
W:So they gave the corpse a cup, and afterward they filled it up
W:And laid him down again upon the bed.
W:And before the morning grey, everybody felt so gay
W:They forgot that Pat was only playing dead.
W:So they loaded him from the bunk, still alive but awful drunk
W:And put him in the coffin with a prayer.
W:And the driver of the cart said, "Be God, I'll never start
W:Until I see that someone pays the fare."
W:Then Pat Malone forgot that he was dead.
W:He raised himself in the coffin, while he said,
W:"If you fairly doubt my credit, you'll be sorry that you said it
W:You drive on or else the corpse will break your head.
W:
W:So the funeral started out on the cemetery route,
W:And the neighbors tried the widow to console.
W:'Til they got beside the base of Malone's last resting place
W:And gently lowered Patrick in the hole.
W:Then Pat began to see, just as plain as one could see
W:That he'd forgot to reckon on the end.
W:And as clods began to drop he broke loose the coffin top
W:And quickly to the earth he did ascend.
W:Then Pat Malone forgot that he was dead,
W:And from the cemetery quickly fled.
W:He came nearly going under, it's a lucky thing, by thunder,
W:That Pat Malone forgot that he was dead.*
