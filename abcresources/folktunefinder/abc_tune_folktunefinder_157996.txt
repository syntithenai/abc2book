W:1. The first Noel the angels did say
W:Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
W:In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
W:On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:2. They looked up and saw a star
W:Shining in the East, beyond them far,
W:And to the earth it gave great light,
W:And so it continued, both day and night.
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:3. And by the light of that same star
W:Three wise men came from country far,
W:To seek for a King was their intent,
W:And to follow the star whereever it went.
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:4. This star drew nigh to the northwest;
W:O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
W:And there it did both stop and stay,
W:Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:5. Then let us all with one accord
W:Sing praises to our heav'nly Lord
W:That hath made heav'n and earth of naught
W:And with His blood mankind hath bought.
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.
W:Born is the King of Israel.
