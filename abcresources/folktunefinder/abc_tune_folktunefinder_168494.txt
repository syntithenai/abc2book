N:Good musicians need good listeners, and two
N:of the best listeners where Johnny and his wife Katey. Johnny would
N:be waiting on his front porch hours before "the fellows" were
N:expected on an evening for a session of music; and no matter how
N:long they played, it was never too late for a few more tunes at
N:the McGoohans. Tea and skohn did not mean (as it usually does) that
N:the fiddling would stop. As Johnny would put it, "We'll have a bite
N:to eat and be back at it for a few more before the night is done."
N:And Katey would never disagree.
