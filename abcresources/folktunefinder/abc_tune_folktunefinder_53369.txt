N:This is the lane that led to the glen 
N:fiddler, the same solitary fiddler
N:of Ed's dreams. Ed heard him often in 
N:the New World, particularly in th
N:early morning hours when dreaming reaches 
N:its peak performance. Long after we left Cor
N:own, Ed began to speak more openly of 
N:this "strange fiddler" whose music seem
N:to come to him from all the familiar 
N:shops in the old neighborhood. Whenever 
N:we got a tape of a promising young player 
N:from Ireland, Ed would listen
N: it intently. "He's good," he'd always 
N:remark, "but he's no glen fiddler
