W:It's of a bold astrologer in London town did dwell,
W:At telling maidens' fortunes, there's none could him excel,
W:There was a nice young serving girl a-living there close by,
W:She came one day to the astrologer all for to have a try.
W:
W:"I hear that you tell fortunes, sir, would you tell me mine" said she,
W:"Of course, my dear, without a doubt if you'll walk upstairs with me."
W:"To walk upstairs with you, kind sir, I'm sure I am afraid,"
W:She spoke it in such modesty as though she were a maid.
W:
W:"To walk upstairs with me, my dear, you need not be afraid,
W:Knowing it was but the other day you with your master laid"
W:Then she began to curse and swear she would her master bring,
W:As witness for both him and her that it was no such thing.
W:
W:"My pretty maid, don't swear and curse, you'll make the deed the worse,
W:For the crown piece that he gave to you, you've got it in your purse"
W:"Oh! indeed you can tell fortunes, sir, you've told me mine," said she,
W:And out she pulled the crown piece--"Good morning, sir, said she.
