T:The North of Amerikay
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:  Learned when I was a child and now written from memory.  There was a
H:song to it which was composed during the American war, as this first verse
H:indicates:
W:The seventeenth of June last by the dawning of the day,
W:Our ship she cast an anchor and landed in the bay;
W:Then our brave heroes bold they quickly marcheed away
W:To fight the Boston rebels in the north of Amerikay.
H:"The Battle of King's Bridge," the English version of the words of this
H:song, may be seen in the "Journal of the Folk Song Society," Vol. II, p. 90.
H:The air bears some slight resemblance to mine.
