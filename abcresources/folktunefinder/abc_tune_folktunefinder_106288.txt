% An excellent double jig called "Tumble the Tinker" was printed for
% the first time in the enlarged edition of "O'Neill's Irish Music for P
%iano
% or Violin", issued in 1915. It was obtained from John McFadden a
% clever traditional Irish fiddler of Chicago, who until then had forgot
%ten
% the tune since last leaving his native Mayo some forty years before.
% Since its publication as stated, a spirited second finish has been
% developed. As varied in the present setting "Tumble the Tinker",
% heretofore so little known, is assuredly worthy of preservation, and
% enhanced publicity.
