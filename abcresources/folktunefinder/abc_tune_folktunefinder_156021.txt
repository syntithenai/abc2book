W: Notes:  The rhythm for Elverumspols is VERY similar to that of  Telespringar.  One
W: is long, two is just a tiny bit shorter, three is about half of two.  Accenting  is heavy
W: one, heaviest two, heavy three.  (ie, it's bouncy.)
W:
W: Because of the time discrepancy between beats 2 & 3, an eighth note within  beat 3
W: is just barely longer than a 16th note within beat 2 (or maybe the same length,
W:depending on the tune and phrase.)  These pols forms were written out with a time
W:signature of 2&1/2 by early tune collectors for good reason.
W:
W: Elverumspols are only played once.  The tag is used by the dancers to thank
W: each other.  Then they promenade,waiting for the next tune.  In Elverum, of
W: course, most of the evening's dances would be Elverum's pols.  Here, we usually
W: play at least 3 in a row to make up the equivalent of 1 dance on the dance program.
