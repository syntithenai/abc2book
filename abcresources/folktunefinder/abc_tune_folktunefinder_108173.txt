T:Hag at the Churn, The
R:jig
H:Caoimhin Mac Aoidh wrote:
H:Is also well known in its Irish title Cailleach 'sa Mhaistrim and should
H:be interprested as the Hag IN the Churn. This refers to the folklore
H:scenario whereby witches would inhabit churns to steal butter. Butter
H:could never be made if a witch was in the house when churning was taking
H:place. Witches could not tolerate this tune and it would therefore be
H:played anytime butter was being churned to drive them away. It was a
H:terrible mark on a woman if she left a house while this tune was being
H:played and churning was going on. It was a big favourite of the Dohertys.
