H:There are two distinct tunes named "Heartsease" and considerable
H:differences of opinion as to whether any of the known lyrics fit either
H:of them. The earliest lyric is "a songe to the tune of hartes ease"
H:from Thomas Richardes' play on an Italian model, called "Misogonus" (c.
H:1560).  Although it scans well, the text is arranged in short verses
H:which would only use half the dance tune, implying that an earlier tune
H:by this name may have had only one strain.
H:
H:Richard Dering's
H:catch "Cries of London" is set to the A strain.
H:
H:Hearts-ease in
H:16th century herbal culture was the little wild pansy, known today as
