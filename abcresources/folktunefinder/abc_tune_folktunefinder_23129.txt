C:Ed Reavy
R:Reel
N:A favorite story of Ed's tells of
N:Hughie, an easygoing sort who had a fierce
N:look when he wore a certain cap. Friends would
N:take Hughie along whenever a fight was
N:anticipated. One look from Hughie and
N:his cap would silence the most
N:quarrelsome bullies. One night, as it
N:would happen, Hughie's friends found
N:themselves in the worst sort of mix and quickly
N:looked for Hughie's help. But Hughie,
N:alas, had ventured out this time without
N:his menacing capeen. "Oh God," one
N:exclaimed, "somebody go fetch Hughie's cap,
N:or there'll be hell to pay for all
N:of us this night"
