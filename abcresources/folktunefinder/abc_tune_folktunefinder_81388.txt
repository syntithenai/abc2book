C:Words and music by Catherine Faber
A:Filk
D:On the tape, "Acts of Creation"
W:She is dressed for sin, in a blouse so thin,
W:With her hair like sunlit flame.
W:Fifteen years old, looking scared and cold,
W:And Candy is her name.
W:Now a man drives by with a hungry eye
W:And a fifty dollar note
W:And he drives her out, down a country route,
W:With a jack-knife in his coat.
W:Chorus:
W:She is gone, she is gone,
W:And the earth closed over her head;
W:Like the ones before, just a worthless whore,
W:Selling sin to buy her bread.
K:F
