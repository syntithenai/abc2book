W:A sailor was walking, on a bright summer's day
W:A squire and his lady were making their way
W:When the sailor he heard the squire say
W:"Tonight with you I mean to stay"
W:And the dumiama dingiama dumiama day.
W:
W:"You must tie a string around your finger
W:With the other end of the string hanging out the winder,
W:And I'll come by, and pull the string
W:And you must come down and let me in,
W:With my dumiama dingiama dumiama day."
W:
W:Says Jack to himself, "Why shouldn't I try
W:And see if a poor sailor can win such a prize"
W:So he went by and pulled the string
W:The lady came down and she let old Jack in
W:With his dumiama dingiama dumiama day.
W:
W:The squire came by. He was whistling a song;
W:Thinking in his heart there would nothing go wrong,
W:But when he got there, no string could be found
W:And so all his hopes were dashed to the ground
W:And his dumiama dingiama dumiama day.
W:
W:The lady woke up, it was just turning light
W:She jumped out of bed in a terrible fright!
W:For there was Jack in his tarry old shirt
W:Behold! his face was all covered with dirt
W:And his dumiama dingiama dumiama day.
W:
W:"Oh what do you mean, you saucy sailor
W:To creep into a lady's chamber and steal her treasure"
W:"Oh no," says Jack, "I just pulled the string
W:And you came down and let me in
W:And my dumiama dingiama dumiama day."
W:
W:"Beg pardon," says Jack, "Have pity I say.
W:I'll steal away very quiet at the dawn of the day."
W:"Oh no!" says the lady, "Don't go too far
W:For I never will part from my jolly Jack tar
W:And his dumiama dingiama dumiama day.
