N:Collected by Daniel Patterson (Shaker Spirituals), from Shaker MS L-14 at the Lebanon, NY Shaker Community, A Collection of Verses, Anthems, and Tunes etc. of Almost Any Description, written by Giles B. Avery (ca. 1835-1836).  According to Patterson, "three Lebanon manuscripts of the mid-1830s bar this prayer song correctly but give no time signature; the scribes had never heard of 5/4 measures. (A later copy written at Canterbury shifts measure by measure from 2/4 to 3/4 time.) The tune itself derives from the large family that serves such shape-note hymns as 'Primrose' and 'Consolation,' and the [traditional UK] ballad 'The Bailiff's Daughter of Islington.' "  Learned from the singing of the Tudor Choir of Seattle (cond. Doug Fullington), arr. Siegfried, on Loft Recordings CD GENTLE WORDS.
N:This version adapted, edited, and arranged (C) 2005 for The Good News-Goodtime Band by Susan O. Hinton.
