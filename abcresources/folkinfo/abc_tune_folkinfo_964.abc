H: D'Urfey prints the tune in C| time throughout; Chappell,
in his revision of it (II [1859], p.531), regularizes in 3/4,
giving two beats to the last note of the first and third
phrases, and changing the signature to G minor.  Bruce and
Stokoe (1882, pp. 76-78) profess to print from D'Urfey, but
again in two flats, regularizing the timing in 3/4, and with
four alterations in notes:  D for initial A, e raised to f
in the third bar, the third d in the same bar lowered to c,
and the first A in the penultimate bar raised to c.
