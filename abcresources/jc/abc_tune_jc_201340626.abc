W:Near to Banbridge town in the County Down
W:On a morning in July,
W:Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen
W:And she smiled as she passed me by,
W:Oh! she looked so neat, from her two white feet
W:To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
W:Such a coaxin' elf, I'd to shake myself,
W:To make sure I was really there.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Oh! from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay
W:And from Galway to Dublin town,
W:No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
W:That I met in the County Down.
W:
W:As she onward sped I scratch'd my head
W:And I gazed with a feelin' quare,
W:There I said, says I, to a passer by
W:'Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?'
W:Oh! he smiled at me, and with pride says he,
W:'That's the gem of Ireland's crown,
W:Young Rosie McCann, from the banks of the Bann,
W:She's the star of the County Down.'
W:
W:At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there,
W:So I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
W:And I'll try sheep's eyes and deludtherin lies,
W:On the heart of the nut-brown Rose,
W:No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke,
W:Tho' my plough with rust turn brown.
W:Till a smiling bride by my own fireside,
W:Sits the star of the County Down.
