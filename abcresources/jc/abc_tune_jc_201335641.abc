W:(Servingman)
W:Well met my brother friend, all on the highway riding,
W:So simply all alone;
W:I pray you to tell me what may your calling be,
W:Or are you a servingman?
W:
W:(Husbandman)
W:O why my brother dear, what makes you to enquire
W:Or any such thing at my hand?
W:But since you are so fain, then I will tell you plain
W:I am a downright husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:If a husbandman you be, then go along with me,
W:And quickly you shall see out of hand;
W:Then in a little space, I will help you to a place
W:Where you may be a servingman.
W:
W:(H)
W:Kind Sir, I 'turn you thanks for your intelligence
W:These things I receive at your hand;
W:But something pray now show, that first I may plainly know
W:The pleasures of a servingman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Why, a servingman has pleasure beyond all sort of measure,
W:With his hawk on his fist as he stands,
W:For the game that he does kill and the meat that does him fill
W:Are pleasures for the servingman.
W:
W:(H)
W:And my pleasure's more than that, to see my oxen fat,
W:And a good stock of hay by them stand;
W:My ploughing and my sowing, my reaping and my mowing,
W:Are pleasures for the husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Why, it is a gallant thing to ride out with a king,
W:With a lord, duke, or any such man;
W:To hear the horns to blow, and see the hounds all in a row,
W:That is pleasure for the servingman.
W:
W:(H)
W:But my pleasure's more, I know, to see my corn to grow,
W:And so thriving all over my land;
W:And therefore do I mean, with my ploughing, with my team,
W:To keep myself a husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Why, the diet that we eat is the choicest of all meat,
W:Such as pig, goose, capon and swan;
W:Our pastry is so fine, we drink sugar in out wine,
W:That is living for a servingman.
W:
W:(H)
W:Talk not of goose or capon, give me good beef or bacon,
W:And good bread and cheese now and then:
W:With pudding, brawn, and souse, all in a farmer's house,
W:That is living for the husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Why, the clothing that we wear is delicate and rare,
W:With our coat, lace, buckles and band;
W:Our shirts are white as milk, our stockings they are silk,
W:That is clothing for the hasbandman.
W:
W:(H)
W:But I value not a hair for delicate fine wear
W:Such as gold is lac-ed upon;
W:Give me a good great coat and in my purse a groat,
W:That is clothing for the husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Kind Sir, it would be bad if none could be had
W:Those tables for to wait upon;
W:There is no lord, duke, or squire, nor ne'er a man of honour
W:Can do without a servingman.
W:
W:(H)
W:But Jack, it would be worse if there was none of us,
W:The plough for to follow along;
W:There is neither lord nor king, nor any other one
W:Can do without the husbandman.
W:
W:(S)
W:Kind Sir, I must confess and I humbly protest
W:I will give to you the uppermost hand;
W:Although your labour's painful it is so very gainful
W:I wish I were a husbandman.
W:
W:(H)
W:So come now let us all both great as well as small
W:Pray for the grain of our land
W:And let us whatsoever do all our best endeavour
W:To maintain the good husbandman.
