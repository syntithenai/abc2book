W:If you listen, I'll sing you a sweet little song
W:Of a flower that's now drooped and dead,
W:Yet dearer to me, yes, than all of its mates,
W:Tho' each holds aloft its proud head.
W:T'was given to me by a girl that I know;
W:Since we've met, faith, I've no repose.
W:She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star
W:And I call her my Wild Irish Rose.
W:      My Wild Irish Rose, The sweetest flow'r that grows.
W:      You may search ev'ry where, but none can compare
W:            with my Wild Irish Rose.
W:      My Wild Irish Rose, The dearest flow'r that grows
W:      And some day for my sake, she may let me take
W:            the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
W:They may sing of their roses which, by other names,
W:Would smell just as sweetly, they say,
W:But I know that my Rose would never consent
W:To have that sweet name taken away.
W:Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
W:The bower, where my true love grows;
W:And my one wish has been that some day I may win
W:The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
