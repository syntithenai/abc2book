%% Cammie Kaynor explained in a 2021-7-9 facebook post:
%% One thing about Fourgone Conclusions is that we sacrificed polish
%% for spontaneity and experimentation in reel time (pun intended)
%% so there were many things we tried that didnâ€™t work and we could
%% count on David commenting, "gosh, that sounded like STOOL!" It
%% became an expression we often used so Nick Hawes memorialized
%% it with an original composition that he named "Stoolies Jig"
%% (to which I wrote a dance of the same name so we played it
%% pretty often). Here is a rough rendition that I will replace
%% with a better one when I get a chance. 
%% (ABC below and dots included as a photo).
