W:I am a poor lad and my fortune is bad,
W:And if ever I gets rich 'tis a wonder,
W:I've spent all my money on girls and strong beer,
W:And what riches I had are all plundered.
W:Field after field to market I sent,
W:Till my land was all gone and my money all spent,
W:My heart was so hard that I never could repent,
W:And 'twas that that brought me to Limbo.
W:
W:Once I could run whilst other did lie,
W:And strut like a crow in the gutter,
W:The people all said that saw me pass by,
W:There goes Mr. Fop in a flutter;
W:To the top and top-gallant I hoisted my sails,
W:With a fine fringy cravat and a wig with three tails,
W:And now I am ready to gnaw my own nails,
W:And drink the cold water of Limbo.
W:
W:I had an old Uncle lived down in the West,
W:And he heard of my sad disaster,
W:Poor soul! after that he could never take no rest,
W:For his troubles came faster and faster;
W:He came to the gaol to view my sad case,
W:And as soon as I saw him I knew his old face,
W:I stood gazing on him like one in amaze,
W:I wished myself safe out of Limbo.
W:
W:Jack, if I should set you once more on your legs,
W:And put you in credit and fashion,
W:Oh! will you leave off those old rakish ways,
W:And try for to govern your passion?
W:Yes Uncle, says I, if you will set me free,
W:I surely will always be ruled by thee,
W:And I'll labour my bones for the good of my soul,
W:And I'll pay them for laying me in Limbo.
W:
W:He pulled out his purse with three thousand pounds,
W:And he counted it out in bright guineas,
W:And when I was free from the prison gates,
W:I went to see Peggy and Jeannie;
W:In my old ragged clothes they knew nought of my gold,
W:They turned me all out in the wet and the cold,
W:You'd a-laughed for to hear how those hussies did scold,
W:How they jawed me for laying in Limbo.
W:
W:I'd only been there a very short time,
W:Before my pockets they then fell to picking,
W:I banged them as long as my cane I could hold,
W:Until they fell coughing and kicking,
W:The one bawled out, Murder! the other did scold,
W:I banged them as long as my cane I could hold,
W:I banged their old bodies for the good of their souls,
W:And I paid them for laying me in Limbo.
