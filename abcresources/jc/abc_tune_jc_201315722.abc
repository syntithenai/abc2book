w:men I'll tease, my-self to please, My moth-er did so be-fore me.
W:I am a brisk and bonny lass,
W:A little over twenty.
W:And by my comely air and dress,
W:Of sweethearts I've got plenty.
W:But I'll beware of wedlock's snare,
W:Tho' dying swains adore me,
W:The men I'll tease, myself to please,
W:My mother did so before me.
W:
W:With fine brocade and diamonds bright,
W:Like merry Spring delighting,
W:My heart, my humours all delight,
W:For my sweet face's inviting.
W:I take delight, both day and night,
W:To be talked of in story.
W:I'll have it said: Here shines a maid!
W:my mother did so before me.
W:
W:To parks and plays I often go,
W:I'll waste each leisure hour;
W:I'll walk and talk with every beau,
W:And make them feel my power.
W:If e'er a spark should fire my heart,
W:From one who does adore me,
W:I'll wed and kiss, in married bliss,
W:my mother did so before me.
W:
W:So well I'll manage when I'm wed,
W:My husband to perfection,
W:And as good wives have always said,
W:Keep husbands in subjection.
W:No snarling fool me e're shall rule,
W:Nor e'er eclipse my glory,
W:I'll let him see, mistress I'll be,
W:my mother did so before me.
