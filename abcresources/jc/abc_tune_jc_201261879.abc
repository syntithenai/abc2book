w:*Aye and there you shall hear me hal-loo!
W:Oh! sweep chimney, sweep!
W:You maidens shake off sleep
W:If you my cry can follow.
W:I climb the chimney top,
W:Without ladder without rope,
W:Aye and there! aye and there! aye and there you shall hear me halloo!
W:
W:Arise! maids, arise!
W:Unseal and rub your eyes.
W:Arise and do your duty.
W:I summon yet again
W:And do not me disdain,
W:That my call, that my call, that my calling's poor and sooty.
W:
W:Behold! here I stand!
W:With brush and scrape in hand.
W:As a soldier that stands on his sentry.
W:I work for the better sort,
W:And well they pay me for't.
W:O I work, O I work, O I work for the best of the gentry.
W:
W:Oh! sweep chimney, sweep!
W:The hours onward creep.
W:Clear away and take
W:The smut that others make.
W:O I clean, O I clean, O I clean what others dirty.
