W:Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,   "Onward," the sailors cry!
W:Carry the lad that's born to be king,   over the sea to Skye!
W:  Loud the winds howl, load the waves roar,     Thunderclaps rend the air;
W:  Baffled our foes stand on the shore,     Follow they will not dare.
W:
W:Bold the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,   ocean's a royal bed,
W:rocked in the deep, Flora will keep   watch by your weary head.
W:
W:Many's the lad, fought on that day,   well the claymore could wield.
W:When the night came, silently lay   dead on Culloden's field.
W:
W:Burned are our homes, exiled and dead,   scattered the loyal men.
W:Yet ere the sword cool in the sheat   Charlie will come again.
