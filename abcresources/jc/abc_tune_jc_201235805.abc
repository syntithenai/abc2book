N: The repeats are confused.  The first part has no final repeat, despite the comment.
N: The 2nd part has a begin-repeat, but no end repeat, giving 40 bars total.
N: Fixed by reversing the repeat sign between the two parts, giving 32 bars.
N: But you should use whatever repeat pattern best fits your dance.
