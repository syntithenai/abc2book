W:And when I reached Co-lumba's shore no danger did I fear
W:It is once I was a man on sea but a maid I am on shore,
W:So adieu, adieu sea captain bold, adieu for evermore.
W:
W:O come back, come back my pretty Mollie, won't you come and marry me?
W:I have a handsome fortune and all I'll give to thee
W:Oh, its once I had my own true love and Johnny was his name
W:And until I find that lad I love I'll live and die a maid.
