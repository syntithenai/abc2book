W:Come all you gay ploughboys, come help me to sing,
W:I will sing in the praise of you all.
W:And if we don't labour, how can we get bread,
W:We will sing and be merry withal.
W:
W:O there was two brethren, two brethrens born,
W:Its there was two b[rethrens] born.
W:O its one was a shepherd, a tender of sheep,
W:And the other a planter of corn.
W:
W:There is April, there is May, there is June and July,
W:What a pleasure to see the corn grow.
W:And when August draws nigh, we will reap sheaves and tie,
W:Go down with our scythes for to mow.
W:
W:O its when we had mowed and reaped every sheaf,
W:We will carry it safe to the barn,
W:We will make no more to do, but to ploughing we'll go,
W:And provide for the very next year.
W:
W:Then at night we retire thro' clods and thro' clay.
W:No comfort at all can we find.
W:We will sit down and sing, and drive away care,
W:We will leave this wide world to repine.
