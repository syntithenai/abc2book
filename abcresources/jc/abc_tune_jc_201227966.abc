%% Once upon a time I had a
%% lovely wife named Priscilla: her grandfather was
%% Luke Harland Richardson. Sarah Beth Richardson's
%% great-grandfather was Clifton Richardson, and he and
%% Luke Harland were brothers. I guess that makes Sarah
%% Beth and me cousins*! Pretty neat, eh? And believe
%% me, Sary Beth's pretty neat, too! She's a real Sweetheart!
