W:All the members of Deuxième Moitié always get a special feeling when they
W:tackle this schottische by Pierre because he wished that his tune would
W:remind us of Carole Guerin KIrschner, a friend, a musician and a colleague
W:who left us too soon and too young.
W:While playing this music, they comfort themselves with the thought that,
W:should thoughts of Carole cause them to play imperfectly, Carole would
W:forgive them for that.
