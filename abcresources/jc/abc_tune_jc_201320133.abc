W:On this day our King was born,
W:Let harp be sounded, fill'd the horn;
W:With methegin to the brim,
W:For ev'ry heart beats high for him.
W:Bards with voices clear and strong,
W:Pour freely forth a joyous song,
W:Cheering day and gladd'ning night,
W:And call the song the "King's Delight".
W:
W:For the King well pleased will be
W:While list'ning to the melody,
W:Rising from his subjects all,
W:In lowly cot or lofty hall.
W:May he live a thousand years,
W:And may this song salute his ears;
W:May his smile be ever bright,
W:When he has heard the "King's Delight."
