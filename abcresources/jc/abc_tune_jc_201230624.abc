%% Iva de Martelly is
%% one of the regulars at the Monday Night Dance
%% in Nelson. She and Elena Madnick are a real
%% cute pair, and boy, you should see them dance!
%% Iva is also learning to be a caller, and Don Primrose
%% sometimes lets her. She does a good job of it, and
%% always gets a nice hand from the crowd. Go, Iva, go!
