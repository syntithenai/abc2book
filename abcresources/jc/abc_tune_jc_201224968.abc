%% Chris lives out in Seattle, where
%% she is immersed in two things - Pediatrics and Contra dancing. I
%% haven't had much to do with her pediatrics, but I have been involved
%% with her dancing when I'm out that way. She's got an awful nice
%% husband named Mike Richardson who calls and plays the fiddle,
%% so I bet she won't have a problem hearing what this sounds like.
%% I think it's kind of a funny little tune, but perhaps it will be fun
%% to dance to. I hope so, Chris, and I hope you like it!
