w:And all of her la-men-ta-tion was, It was John of the Ha-zel-green
     %End of file
W:While riding down that greenwood road
W:There sat a lady who mourned,
W:And all of her lamentation was,
W:It was John of the Hazelgreen.
W:
W:You are welcome with me, kind miss,
W:You are welcome with me, said he,
W:And you may have my oldest son
W:A husband for to be.
W:
W:I don't want your oldest son,
W:He's neither lord nor king.
W:I intend to be the bride of none
W:But John of Hazelgreen.
W:
W:*For he's tall and his shoulders broad,
W:He's the lord of all our kin.
W:His hair hangs down like the links of gold,
W:He's John of the Hazelgreen.
W:
W:While riding down that lengthy lane,
W:That lane that leads to town,
W:O up stepped John of the Hazelgreen
W:And helped his lady down.
W:
W:Forty times he kissed her rudy lips
W:And forty times he kissed her chin,
W:And forty times he kissed her ruby lips
W:And let his lady in.
