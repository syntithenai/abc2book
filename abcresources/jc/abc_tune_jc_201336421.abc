W:We shepherds are the best of men,
W:That e'er trod English ground;
W:When we come to an alehouse
W:We value not a crown.
W:We spend our money freely,
W:We pay before we go;
W:There's no ale on the wolds,
W:Where the stormy winds do blow.

W:We spend our money freely,
W:We pay before we go;
W:There's no ale on the wolds,
W:Where the stormy winds do blow.

W:A man that is a shepherd
W:Does need a valiant heart,
W:He must not be faint-hearted,
W:But boldly do his part.
W:He must not be faint-hearted,
W:Be it rain, or frost, or snow,
W:With no ale on the wolds
W:Where the stormy winds do blow.
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:He must not be faint-hearted,
W:Be it rain, or frost, or snow,
W:With no ale on the wolds
W:Where the stormy winds do blow.
W:
W:When I kept sheep on Blockley Hills
W:It made my heart to ache
W:To see the ewes hang out their tongues
W:And hear the lambs to bleat;
W:Then I plucked up my courage
W:And o'er the hills did go,
W:And penned them in the fold
W:While the stormy winds did blow.
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:Then I plucked up my courage
W:And o'er the hills did go,
W:And penned them in the fold
W:While the stormy winds did blow.
W:
W:
W:As soon as I had folded them
W:I turned me back in haste
W:Unto a jovial company
W:Good liquor for to taste;
W:For drink and jovial company
W:They are my heart's delight,
W:Whilst my sheep lie asleep
W:All the fore-part of the night.
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:For drink and jovial company
W:They are my heart's delight,
W:Whilst my sheep lie asleep
W:All the fore-part of the night.
