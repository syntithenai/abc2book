%% Ryan Thomson lives over in
%% Newmarket, NH, in the Seacoast Region. He writes under the name of "Captain
%% Fiddle", and he's put out whole bunch of fine musical publications. Ryan's a real
%% good fiddle player, too, and when his right bow arm gave out on him, he got a fiddle
%% set up for a left-handed player and taught himself to play that way. Try that sometime
%% and you will learn the meaning of true dedication. All the best to you, Ryan -
%% we'll have some tunes the next time we meet -
