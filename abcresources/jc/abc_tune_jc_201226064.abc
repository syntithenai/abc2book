%% Once upon a time I had a car
%% stranded up in Dublin, and Rob Morris and Sasha Hall were kind
%% enough to take me up there so I could pick it up. I thought that
%% was real nice of Rob to stop for me (I was hitching!), and so
%% perhaps he'll accept this tune as some kind of compensation. I
%% really appreciated that ride, Robby - thanks a lot!
