%% Wonderful writer
%% Jane Eklund, from Hancock, is Programs Information
%% Officer for N.H. State Council on the Arts, and also the
%% editor of their beautiful new publication, The N.H. Arts Journal.
%% So why this tune? Well, it's because she is a close friend of Sarah
%% Bauham, a twanger on a mandolin, and has been very nice to
%% me, that's why! Thanks, Jane!!
