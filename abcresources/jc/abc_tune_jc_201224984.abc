%% If you've ever been to anything
%% involving traditional music in the Philly area, then you've
%% seen, met, jammed, or whatever, with Dave Miller. He is the
%% definitive enthusiast. He brings himself and his fiddle to
%% Neffa every year, too, so I know that, one way or another, I'm
%% going to enjoy playing music with him before long. Best
%% wishes always to you, Dave.
