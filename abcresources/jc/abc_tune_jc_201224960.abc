%% Alaska is the home of a huge
%% amount of great stuff, and this includes Rex Blazer, of
%% Fairbanks. What a joy it is to be around him when he
%% winds up his beautiful fiddle and starts belting out a great
%% tune, especially if he has Juanita Anderson on the piano.
%% Now _there's_ a great combination that I hope you get to
%% hear someday. I once heard them in my living room.
%% Wonderful!!
