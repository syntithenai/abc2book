%% About once a year I get
%% a great phone call from Wendell, MA, and it's Susan Kevra asking
%% me if I'd like to join her and husband Bill Tomczak in playing
%% for a dance at the Guiding Star Grange in Greenfield. It's always
%% a real happy evening, and such fun to get together with two
%% good friends.
