w: Der-ry down, down, Down, der-ry down.
W:It's of a fine frigate, La Pique was her name,
W:All in the West Indies she bore great fame.
W:For cruel bad usage of ev'ry degree,
W:Like slaves in the galley we ploughed the salt sea.

W:(Chorus)
W:Derry down, down,
W:Down, derry down.

W:Now at four in the morning our work does begin,
W:In our 'tween decks and cockpit a bucket might swim;
W:Our main and top foreman so loudly do bawl
W:For sand and for holystone both great and small.
W:
W:Now Mr McKeever we know him too well,
W:He comes up on deck and he cuts a great swell;
W:It's "Up on them yards, boys, and open your eyes,
W:I've a pump handle here to trim down your size."
W:
W:And now, my brave boys, comes the best of the fun,
W:It's hands about ship and reef tops'ls in one;
W:It's lay aloft topmen and the hellum goes down,
W:And clew up your tops'ls as the mainyard comes round.
W:
W:[Now your quids of tobacco, I'd have you to mind,
W:If you spit on the deck, that's your death-warrant signed;
W:If you spit over bow, over gangway, or starn,
W:You're sure of three dozen by way of no harm.
W:
W:So now, brother sailors, where'er you may be,
W:From them West India frigates I'll have you keep free,
W:For they'll haze you and work you till you ain't worth a damn
W:And send you half-dead to your dear native land.]
