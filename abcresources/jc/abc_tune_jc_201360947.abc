W:As I was a goin' over Gilgara mountain,
W:I spied Colonel Farrell and his money he was countin',
W:First I drew my pistols and then I drew my rapier, sayin':
W:"Stand and deliver for I am your bold deceiver".
W:  Musha ringum a duram da,

W:  whack fol the daddyo,
W:  there's whiskey in the jar.

W:He counted out his money and it made a pretty penny,
W:I put it in my pocket to take home to darlin' Jenny.
W:She sighed and swore she loved me and never would deceive me,
W:but the devil take the women for they always lie so easy.
W:  Musha...
W:
W:I went into me chamber all for to take a slumber,
W:to dream of gold and girls and of course it was no wonder,
W:me Jenny took me charges and she filled them up with water,
W:called on Colonel Farrell to get ready for the slaughter.
W:  Musha...
W:
W:Next morning early before I rose for travel,
W:acame a band of footmen and likewise Colonel Farrell,
W:I goes to draw my pistol for she'd stole away my rapier.
W:But a prisoner I was taken I couldn't shoot the water.
W:  Musha...
W:
W:They put me into jail with a judge all awritin'
W:robbin' Colonel Farrell on Gilgarra Mountain.
W:But they didn't take me fists and I knocked the jailer down, and bid a farewell to this
W:tight fisted town.
W:  Musha...
W:
W:I'd like to find me brother the one that's in the army
W:I don't know where he's stationed in Cork or in Killarney.
W:Together we'd go roamin' o'er the mountains of Kilkenny,
W:and I swear he'd treat me fairer than me darlin' sportin' Jenny.
W:  Musha...
W:
W:There's some takes delight in the carriages and rollin',
W:some takes delight in the hurley or the bollin'.
W:But I takes delight in the juice of the barley, courtin'
W:pretty maids in the mornin', oh so early.
W:  Musha...

W:Alternative lyrics:
W:
W:As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
W:I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
W:I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
W:Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a bold deceiver
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
W:Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
W:There's whiskey in the jar
W:
W:I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
W:I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
W:She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
W:But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
W:I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
W:But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
W:Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:'t was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
W:Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
W:I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
W:I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
W:and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
W:but I take delight in the juice of the barley
W:and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
W:If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
W:And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
W:And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
W:
W:(Chorus)
