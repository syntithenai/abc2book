w:Since Paul be-came a mem-ber of That ter-ri-ble foot-ball club.
W:I have a favourite brother
W:And his Christian name is Paul.
W:He's lately joined a football club
W:For he's mad about football.
W:He's two black eyes already
W:And teeth lost from his gob,
W:Since Paul became a member of
W:That terrible football club.
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:For he's football crazy,
W:He's football mad,
W:The football it has taken away
W:The little bit o' sense he had,
W:And it would take a dozen servants
W:To wash his clothes and scrub,
W:Since Paul became a member of
W:That terrible football club.
W:
W:In the middle of the field, one afternoon,
W:The captain says, "Now Paul,
W:Would you kindly take this place-kick
W:Since you're mad about football?"
W:So he took forty paces backwards,
W:Shot off from the mark.
W:The ball went sailing over the bar
W:And landed in New York.
W:
W:For he's football crazy ...
W:
W:His wife says she'll leave him
W:If Paulie doesn't keep
W:Away from football kicking
W:At night-time in his sleep.
W:He calls out 'Pass, McGinty!"
W:And other things so droll
W:Last night he kicked her out of bed
W:And swore it was a goal!
W:
W:For he's football crazy ...
