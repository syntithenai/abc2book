No problem. I can play it reasonably well if no-one is around. Then, “Now play it as a waltz” Hmmm not so easy. “Now try it as a slow air” Keeping it smooth and hitting the right intonation ain’t as easy as it sounds. Try it with a favourite jig. More swallows and relaxation during the afternoon and an unsuccessful attempt to find out the Liverpool score.
 
Saturday was competition night. The junior was won, after a couple of years of being placed, by Ivan Brown. My vote would have gone to my little friend (Am I allowed to say that?) Dylan. OK, so his playing is going downhill with the brakes off but, he does enjoy himself. Or as Lauren said in her adjudication, he goes at it like a dog on (thinks: Oh b*gger this is a junior competition but I’ve gone too far to stop) heat. (thinks: I’ll try and get away with it) Err, coiled spring.
 
After four years of trying, the senior section was won by Jamie Nemeth who looked totally gobsmacked at the announcement. But, he was totally outdone by his father who was floating around about two feet off the ground for the rest of the week-end. I think Jamie managed to prise the trophy out of his grasp for the triumphal entry into the pub on Sunday.
 
The Sunday lunch over and a session under way, it was time to head east again for another 12 months.
 
*Shandor Nemeth (Jamie’s father) is a master baker with the accent on master. Every year he bakes batches for us which come straight from the oven to the plate. Even if you don’t know Welsh music or even if you don’t like the fiddle. If you are a lover of bread, it’s worth coming just for that.
