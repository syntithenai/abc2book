O:Broadwood and Maitland, 1893, pp. 12-13. Sung by William Moat,
O:a Whitby fisherman, North Riding, Yorkshire, December, 1891.
O:Noted by H. M. Bower.
H:The editors note that this tune is related to a Sussex song,
"The Seasons of the Year" (op.cit., p. 143); and the latter in
turn to a Wiltshire "Sheep-shearing Song" (ibid., p. 149). With
the second half, above, cf. "Over Yonder's a Park" (JEFSS, IV
[1910], p. 63). This singer, say the editors, insisted on the
long pauses.
N: H means fermata (lengthen the note) I means inverted fermata (shorten it).
