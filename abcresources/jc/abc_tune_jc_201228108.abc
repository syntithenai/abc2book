%% My friend, Gary
%% Sredzienski, has a nice little doggy buddy named
%% "Poodle" who loves music. I happened to be there when
%% Gary played him this tune on his accordion, and I wish
%% you could have been there, too, to see Poodle wag his tail
%% in time to the music. Very remarkable dog!

%% For Poodle - in memoriam, 2001.
%% With love to him and his master.
