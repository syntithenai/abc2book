W:As I walked down by the Oxborough Banks
W:Where the maids of Australia do play their wild pranks
W:Beneath a green shady bower I sat myself down
W:Where the birds sang so gaily enchanted all round
W:In the forest of native Australia
W:In the forest of native Australia
W:Where the maidens are handsome and gay.
W:
W:Now she dived in the water without fear or dread
W:Her beautiful limbs she exceedingly spread
W:Her hair hung in wrinkles, the colour was black
W:"Sir", said she, "you will see how I float on my back
W:On the stream in me native Australia
W:On the stream in me native Australia
W:Where the maidens are handsome and gay."
W:
W:Now being exhausted she swam to the brink
W:"Assistance, kind sir, for I surely shall sink".
W:As quick as the lightning I took hold of her hand
W:My foot slipped and we fell on the sand
W:Here, on the native plains of Australia
W:Here, on the native plains of Australia
W:Just as the sun went down.
W:
W:Now we frolicked together in the highest of glee
W:In the finest Australia you ever did see
W:The sun it went down and the clouds did resign
W:Then I left the fair maid of Australia behind
W:Then I left the fair maid of Australia behind
W:Just as the sun went down.
W:
W:Now six months being over and nine being come
W:This pretty fair maid she brought forth a fine son
W:"Oh where was his father?"; he could not be found
W:And she cursed the hour that she laid on the ground
W:In her native the plains of Australia
W:In her native the plains of Australia
W:Where the maidens are handsome and gay.
