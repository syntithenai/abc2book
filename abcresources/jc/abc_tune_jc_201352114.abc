W:2. I counted out my money, and it made a pretty penny.
W:I put it in my pocket, and I gave it to my Jenny.
W:She sighed, and she swore that she never would betray me.
W:But, the devil take the women, for they never can go easy.

W:I dreamt of gold and jewels, and sure it was no wonder.
W:For Jenny took my charges, and she filled them up with water,
W:Then sent for Captain Farrel to make ready for the slaughter.

W:The guards were all around me and likewise Captain Farrel.
W:I first produced my pistol, for she stole away my rapier,
W:But I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken.

W:5. Well, if anyone can aid me, it's my brother in the army.
W:I think that he is stationed in Cork or in Killarney.
W:And, if he'd come and join me, we'd go rovin in Kilkenny.
W:I swear he'd treat me fairer than me darlin', sportin' Jenny!

W:Still others take delight in the carriages a'rolling.
W:But, I take delight in the juice of the Barley,
W:And kissin' pretty women when the sun is risin' early.
