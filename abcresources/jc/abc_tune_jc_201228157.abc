%% Tony Mateo is a good friend,
%% a great musician, and a talented multi-instrumentalist (yes,
%% he is all the above!) who lives in Seattle, the home of so many other
%% dear friends. Quite often, when I'm out at Folklife, I get to play
%% with Tony, and I must say, it's always a pleasure. Cheers, Tony!
