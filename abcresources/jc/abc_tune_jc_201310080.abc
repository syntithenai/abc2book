W:2.
W: The Minstrel fell! But the foeman's chain
W: Could not bring that proud soul under.
W: The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again,
W: For he tore its chords asunder;
W: And said "No chains shall sully thee,
W: Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
W: Thy songs were made for the pure and free;
W: They shall never sound in slavery!
W:3.
W: The minstrel boy will return one day,
W: When we hear the news, we will cheer it.
W: The minstrel boy will return we pray,
W: Torn in body, perhaps, but not in spirit.
W: Then may he play his harp in peace,
W: In a world such as Heaven intended,
W: For every quarrel of Man must cease,
W: And every battle shall be ended.
