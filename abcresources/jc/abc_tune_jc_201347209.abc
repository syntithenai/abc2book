W:Says Turpin, "He won't find me out,
W:I've hid my money in my boot."
W:The lawyer says, "No one can find
W:The gold I've stitched in my cape behind."

W:As they rode by the foot of the hill
W:Turpin commands him to stand still.
W:Says he, "Tou cape I must cut off
W:For my mare she needs a new saddle-cloth."

W:Turpin now at last is took,
W:And no he lingers in a jail
W:Where his ill-luck he doth bewail.
W:

W:And hang upon a gallows high.
W:His legacy is the hangman's rope
W:For the shooting of a dunghill cock.
