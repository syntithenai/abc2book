w:As I was a-walk-ing down Lon-don, From_ Wap-ping to Rat-cliffe High-way, I_ chanced to pop in-to a gin-shop, To spend a long night and a day.
W:As I was a-walking down London
W:From Wapping to Ratcliffe Highway
W:I chanced to pop into a gin-shop
W:To spend a long night and a day
W:
W:A young doxy came rolling up to me
W:And asked if I'd money to sport
W:For a bottle of wine changed a guinea
W:And she quickly replied: 'That's the sort'
W:
W:When the bottle was put on the table
W:There was glasses for everyone
W:When I asked for the change of my guinea
W:She tipped me a verse of her song
W:
W:This lady flew into a passion,
W:And placed both her hands on her hip,
W:Saying: 'Sailor, don't you know our fashion?
W:Do you think you're on board of your ship?'
W:
W:'If this is your fashion to rob me
W:Such a fashion I'll never abide
W:So launch out the change of my guinea
W:Or else I'll give you a broadside'
W:
W:A gold watch hung over the mantel
W:So the change of my guinea I take
W:And down the stairs I run nimbly
W:Saying: 'Darn my old boots, I'm well paid'
W:
W:The night being dark in my favour
W:To the river I quickly did creep
W:And I jumped in a boat bound for Deptford
W:And got safe aboard of my ship
W:
W:So come all you bold young sailors
W:That ramble down Ratcliffe Highway
W:If you chance to pop into a gin-shop
W:Beware, lads, how long you do stay
W:
W:For the songs and the liquors invite you
W:And your heart will be all in a rage
W:If you give them a guinea for a bottle
W:You can go to the devil for change
