W:A lawyer he went out one day,  
W:A-riding through the city,
W:It was there he met with a handsome maid,
W:And he thought her so sweet and pretty.
W:
W:"Good morning to you, pretty maid,
W:O whiter are you going?"
W:"I am going a-down yonder meadow," she said,
W:"Where my father he is a-mowing."
W:
W:"I'll take you up to London town,
W:And all such lovely places,
W:I will busk you into a silken gown,
W:Gold rings and gold chains and laces."
W:
W:"I'll have none of your London town,
W:Nor any such lovely places,
W:I will not be busked into a silken gown,
W:Gold rings and gold chains and laces."
W:
W:And now she is a poor man's wife,
W:Her husband dearly loves her,
W:And she lives a sweet and contented life,
W:There's no lady in town above her.
