Composed for the dance "The Dancing Dominie" devised by Jean Attwood  and  dedicated  to  the  late
Barry Priddey.  Barry was a great help to the Lothian Scottish Dance Band when we made 3 recordings
for the RSCDS Sutton Coldfield Branch.  Barry devised many well known dances and was the person who
also  helped  get the Sutton Coldfield Dance Index off the ground.  The ongoing compilation of this
was passed to me when Barry died and it is my intention that  it  will  carry  on  the  great  work
created by Barry.
