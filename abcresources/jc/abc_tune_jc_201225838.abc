%% Chris Carpenter lives down
%% in Philly, and we've played tunes together for years. He's
%% one of the best tenor banjo players I ever heard (he and
%% Jack O'Connor would make a great team - Pete Colby said Jack was
%% the best he ever hear) - Chris plays with the Philadelphia Ceilidh
%% Group, and I hope we get together real soon, Chris --
