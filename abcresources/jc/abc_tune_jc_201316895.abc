W:(Chorus)
W:No wonder people grumble at the taxes more and more,
W:There never was such taxes in Ireland before.
W:
W:They're going to tax the farmers, and their horses, carts and ploughs,
W:They're going to tax the billygoats, the donkeys and the cows;
W:They're going to tax the mutton, and they're going to tax the beef,
W:And they're going to tax the women if they do not learn to read.
W:
W:They will tax the ladies' chignons and their boas, veils and mats,
W:They're going to tax the mouse traps and the mousies, cats and rats;
W:They'll tax the ladies' flouncey gowns, their high-heeled boots and stays,
W:And before the sun begins to shine they'll tax the bugs and fleas.
