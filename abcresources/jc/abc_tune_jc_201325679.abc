w:Poor_ old horse, poor_ old horse, Poor_ old horse, let_ him _die.
W:Once I was a young horse all in my youthful prime,
W:My mane hung over my shoulders and my coat he did so shine,
W:But now I'm getting old my features do decay.
W:My master he looks down on me and his words I heard him say:

W:(Chorus)
W:Poor old horse, Poor old horse,
W:Poor old horse, let him die.
W:
W:My master used to ride me at every chase all round,
W:My legs they were so nimble I could trip over the ground,
W:But now I'm getting old and scarce able to crawl,
W:My master he looks down on me, saying I am no use at all.
W:
W:Once all in the stable I use good corn and hay
W:That grows in yonder fields and likewise meadows so gay,
W:But now I'm getting old I scarce get any at all,
W:For I'm obliged to nibble the short grass that grows against the wall.
W:
W:Once all in the stable I was keep so fine and warm
W:To keep my tender limbs from all aching, pain and harm,
W:But now I'm getting old to the fields I'm obliged to go,
W:Let it hail, rain or sunshine, or the winds blow high or low.
W:
W:My hide unto the hunstman so freely I will give,
W:My bodt to the hounds, for I'd rather die than live,
W:Than lay my legs so low that have run so many a mile,
W:Over hedges over ditches, over turnpike gates and stiles.
