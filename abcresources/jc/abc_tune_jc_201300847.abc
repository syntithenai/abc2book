W:Last Valentine's day, bright Phoebus shone clear,
W:We had not been a hunting for the space of one year.
W:I mounted Black Clover, that horse of great fame,
W:For to hear the horn blow and the words "Tally ho! ho!"
W:(Chorus)
W:Ho! Ho! ho! ho! ho!
W:Hark, Forward! Who says "Tally ho!?"
W:
W:"Hark! Hark! into cover!" Colonel Wyndham he cried,
W:He had no sooner spoke than a fox he espied;
W:"Tally ho!" was the word, and then, "Crack!" the whip!
W:And that being the signal, our hounds they let slip.
W:
W:Then up stepped Jim Norris who cared not a pin
W:When he pushed at the stream and his horse tumbled in;
W:And as he crossed over, he spied the bold Ren,
W:With his tongue hanging out turning back to his den.
W:
W:Our hounds and our horses they all were so good
W:As ever broke cover or dashed through a wood.
W:Come fill up your glasses and round let us drink,
W:For whilst we are hunters we never will shrink.

W:(In verses 3 and 4 substitute "Huzza!" for "who says" in the last line of the chorus.)
