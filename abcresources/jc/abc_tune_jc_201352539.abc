W:At the early age of sixteen years he left his native home,
W:And to Australia's sunny land he was inclined to roam.
W:He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he stabbed James MacEvoy.
W:A terror to Australia was the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:One morning on the prairie, wild Jack Duggan rode along
W:While listening to the mockingbird, singing a cheerful song.
W:Out jumped three troopers, fierce and grim; Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy.
W:They'd all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:Surrender now, Jack Duggan, come; you see there's three to one.
W:Surrender in the Queen's name, sir; you are a plundering son.
W:Jack drew two pistols from his side, and glared upon Fitzroy
W:I'll fight but not surrender, cried the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground.
W:He fired point bank at Davis, too, who fell dead at the sound.
W:But a bullet pierced his brave young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy.
W:And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy.
