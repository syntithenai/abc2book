w:For-go, Twill-in-gate, More-ton's Har-bour, All a-round the cir-cle.

W:(Chorus)
W:Hip yer partner, Sally Tibbo,
W:Hip yer partner, Sally Brown!
W:Forgo, Twillingate, Moreton's Harbour,
W:All around the circle.
W:
W:I took Lizer to a dance,
W:And faith! but she could travel!
W:Every step that she did take
W:Was up to her knees in gravel.
W:
W:Susan White, she's out of sight,
W:Her petticoat wants a border;
W:Old Sam Oliver in the dark
W:He kissed her in the corner.
W:
W:Flour and crumbs to cover the fish,
W:Cake and Tea for supper,
W:Cod fish in the spring o' the year
W:Fried in rancid butter.
W:
W:I don't want your rancid fish,
W:That's no good for winter,
W:I could buy as good as that
W:Down in Bonavista
