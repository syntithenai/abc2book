%% Have you had a chance to
%% dance to Paul McCulloch? He's a real find caller from
%% Portland, OR, and every once in a while over the past
%% several years I've had the good fortune to play for
%% him. It's always been a happy time and I'm looking
%% forward to our next encounter. Hope it's soon, Paul!
