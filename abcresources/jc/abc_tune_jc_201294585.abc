W:As Joseph was a-walking He heard an angel sing.
W:This night shall be born our heavenly King
W:
W:1. He neither shall be born in housen nor in hall,
W:Nor in the place of Paradise, But in an ox 's stall
W:
W:2. He neither shall be clothed in purple and pall,
W:But all in fair linen as wear babies all
W:
W:3. He neither shall be rocked in silver and gold
W:But in a wooden cradle that rocks on the mould.
W:
W:4. He neither shall be christened in white wine and red,
W:But in the fair spring water as we were christened.
