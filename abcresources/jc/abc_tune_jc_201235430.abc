Composed as the original tune for the dance 'Tam O' Shanter' devised by Barry Priddey. It was first recorded
on 'Second Celebration' by the Lothian Scottish Dance Band in 1986. This was one of several recordings made
by the band when Barry was teacher for the RSCDS Sutton Coldfield Branch. The title reminds me of many
pleasant days spent with my wife's aunt and uncle who lived in Fullarton Drive, Troon.
