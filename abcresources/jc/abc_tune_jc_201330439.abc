W:"Oh, then tell me, Sean O'Farrell, where the gathering is t be."
W:"In the old spot by the river, right well known to you and me.
W:One word more - for signal token - whistle up the marching tune,
W:With your pike upon your shoulder, by the Rising of the Moon?
W:
W:Out from many a mudwall cabin eyes were watching through the night,
W:Many a manly breast was throbbing for the blessed warning light.
W:Murmurs passed along the valley, like the banshee's lonely croon,
W:And a thousand blades were flashing at the Rising of the Moon.
W:
W:There beside the singing river that dark mass of men were seen,
W:Far above the shining weapons hung their own immortal green.
W:"Death to every for and traitor! Forward! Strike the marching tune,
W:And hurrah, my boys, for freedon! 'Tis the Rising of the Moon."
