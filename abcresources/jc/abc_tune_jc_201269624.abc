w:mar--row She was court-ed by nine gen-tle-men And a plough-boy lad in Yar-row
W:There was a lady in the west
W:You scarce would find her marrow
W:She was courted by nine gentlemen
W:And a ploughboy lad in Yarrow.
W:
W:These nine sat drinking at the wine
W:As oft they'd done before-O
W:And they made a vow among themselves
W:To fight with him on Yarrow.
W:
W:She's washed his face, she's combed his hair
W:As oft she's done before-O
W:Gave him a brand down by his side
W:To fight for her on Yarrow.
W:
W:As he came o'er yon high high hill
W:And down the glen so narrow
W:Nine armed men lay waiting him
W:Upon the braes of Yarrow.
W:
W:It's three he wounded, three withdrew
W:And three he's killed on Yarrow
W:Till her brother John stepped in behind
W:And pierced his body thorough.
W:
W:O father dear, I dreamed a dream
W:I fear it will prove sorrow
W:I dreamed I was pulling heather green
W:On the dowie dens of Yarrow.
W:
W:O daughter dear I read your dream
W:To you it will prove sorrow
W:Your true love John lies dead and slain
W:On the dowie dens of Yarrow.
W:
W:As she went o'er yon high high hill
W:And down the glen so narrow
W:Twas there she found her true love John
W:Lying cold and dead on Yarrow.
W:
W:She washed his face, she combed his hair
W:As she had done before-O
W:And she kissed the blood from off his wounds
W:On the dowie dens of Yarrow.
W:
W:Her hair it was three quarters long
W:The colour it was yellow
W:She tied it round his middle small
W:And carried him home to Yarrow.
W:
W:O daughter dear, dry up your tears
W:And weep no more for sorrow
W:I'll wed you to a better man
W:Than the ploughboy lad of Yarrow.
W:
W:O father dear you've seven sons
W:You may wed them all tomorrow
W:But the fairest flower among them all
W:Was the lad I wooed on Yarrow.
