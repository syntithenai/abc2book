%% Every year when I go out to Seattle
%% for the Northwest Folklife Festival, I run into the Canote family. They are
%% grand folks, and one of them is Liz Klein-Canote, a.k.a. Mrs. Greg. She
%% always makes a point of being real nice to me, so I thought I'd
%% try to pay her back with a tune of her own. I sure hope you like it,
%% Liz, that is, if you can ever find someone to play it for you! :-)
%% Love from Bob
