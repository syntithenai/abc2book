W:O Ranzo wuz no sailor,
W:He wuz a New York tailor.
W:
W:Though Ranzo wuz no sailor,
W:He shipped aboard a whaler.
W:
W:Ranzo couldn't steer 'er,
W:Did ye ever hear anything queerer.
W:
W:The mate he wuz a dandy,
W:Far too fond of brandy.
W:
W:They put him holystonin',
W:And cared not for his groanin'.
W:
W:They said he wuz a lubber,
W:And made him eat whale-blubber.
W:
W:He washed once in a fortnight,
W:He said it was his birthright.
W:
W:They took him to the gangway,
W:An' gave him lashin's twenty.
W:
W:They gave him lashes thirty,
W:Because he wuz so dirty.
W:
W:The Capten gave him thirty,
W:His daughter begged for mercy.
W:
W:She gave him cake an' water,
W:An' a bit more than she outer.
W:
W:She taught him navigation,
W:An' gave him eddication.
W:
W:Ranzo is now a skipper,
W:Of a Yankee whaler.
W:
W:He married the Ol' Man's daughter,
W:An' still sails on blue water.
W:
W:He's known wherever them whalefish blow,
W:As the toughest bastard on the go.
