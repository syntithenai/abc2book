W: 2 Ah! Kate cried the Youth I have often heard tell,
W: \t That Women are fickle as fair,
W: If so to each fond hope I take a farewell,
W: \t For pleasure can never dwell there,
W: Ne'er doubt she replied while a modest blush rose,
W: \t Which crimson'd her Cheek o'er awhile,
W: 'Tis Virtue alone can a passion disclose,
W: \t A Passion that's void of all guile.
W: 
W: 3 Now over the Hills as they both bent their way,
W: \t The Sky form'd a picture all dread,
W: The rains beat aloud, and the winds fiercely blew,
W: \t And thunder roll'd over their head,
W: When Henry alas! fell a Victim to fate,
W: \t And sunk in the realms of the blest,
W: Who left for to sigh his lovelorn poor Mate,
W: \t Who now was depriv'd of her Love.
