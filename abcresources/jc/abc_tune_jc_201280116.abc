w: In Ox-ford to-wn in Ox-ford-shire_ There lived some migh-_ty hounds *
W:You Gentlemen of high renown, come listen unto me
W:That take delight in fox and hounds in ev'ry high degree.
W:A story true to you I'll tell concerning of a fox,
W:In Oxford Town in Oxfordshire there lived some mighty hounds.
W:
W:Bold Reynard being all in his den and standing on the ground,
W:Bold Reynard being all in his den and hearing of those hounds.
W:I think I hear some joyful hounds thinking for me to kill,
W:Before they catch me by my brush I'll climb those mighty hills.
W:
W:Bold Reymard cock-ed up his head and up the hill he went,
W:Bold Reynard cock-ed out his brush and he left a gallant scent.
W:Your hounds are staunch I know them well, they drive me like the wind,
W:I will step so lightly on the ground I'll leave no scent behind.
W:
W:We drove Bold Raynard five hours or more without a check of speed,
W:We drove Bold Reynard five hours or more till we came to Oxford Green.
W:There we caught Bold Reynard all by his brush never to let him go,
W:He has had so many of our feather-ed fowls down in the valley below.
W:
W:Our Huntsman blows his joyful sound, Relope, my boys, fulfil
W:He will have no more of our feather-ed fowls nor lambs on yonder hill.
W:Oh pardon, Huntsman, then he cried.  No pardon you shall have.
W:Take off his head likewise his brush and give him three Hurrays.
