%% This tune
%% came during Irish Week at Augusta. That's
%% where I see Brendan every year; when he was
%% younger he was taking lessons in Irish fiddling
%% and now he's on staff teaching fiddle and showing
%% others the way. Sometimes I get to play piano
%% with him and his friends (_thank you_, Brendan!)
%% and believe me, _that's_ a fun time! Cheers, Brendan!
