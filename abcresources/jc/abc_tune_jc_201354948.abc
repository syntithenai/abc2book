W:Young Herchard has on his Zunday claws,
W:His buckskin breeches and silken hose,
W:A brand-new hat upon his head,
W:As were bedecked wi' ribbon so red.
W:
W:Young Herchard, he rode without any fear,
W:Till he came to the whoam of his own sweet dear;
W:He up and shouted "Hullo, hullo!
W:Be the volks at whoam? zay ess or noo."
W:
W:The servants quickly let let Dick in,
W:So that his coortin' might begin;
W:And when he got inside the hall,
W:He loudly for Meess Jeeun did bawl.
W:
W:Meess Jeunn came down withour delay,
W:To see what Herchard had got for to zay,
W:He says, "Ah suppose ye do knaw, Meess Jeeun,
W:That Oi be Herchard o' Taunton Deeun?
W:
W:"Oi'm an honest lad though Oi be poor,
W:And Oi never was in love avoor;
W:But feyhter he've sent Oi out for to woo,
W:And Oi can't fancy noan bu you."

W:Pray how for me will you provide?"
W:"Oi'll give you all Oi have, Oi'm zure,
W:What can a poor vellow do fur ye more?
W:
W:"For Oi cap reap and Oi can zow,
W:And Oi can plough and Oi can hoe;
W:Oi goes to market wi' vather's hay,
W:And earns me ninepence every day."

W:"Ninepence a day would never do,
W:For I must have silks and satins too;
W:Twill ne'er be enough for you and I,"
W:"Oh coom," says Herchard, "Us can but ry."
W:
W:"Fur Oi've a pig poked up in a stoi,
W:As'll coom to us when Granny do doi;
W:And if you'll consent fur to marry me now,
W:Whoi feyther he'll give us his voin vat zow."

W:He won Meess Jeeun avoor it were night;
W:An' when her'd got no moor fur to zay,
W:Whoi he gee'd here a kiss, and her coom'd away.
