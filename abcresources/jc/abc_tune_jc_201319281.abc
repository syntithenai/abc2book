Skyball Paint was a Devil's saint, and his eyes was a fiery red
Good men have tried this horse to ride, but all of them are dead
Now, I won't brag, but I rode this nag til his blood began to boil
then I hit the ground and ate three pounds of good ol' Texas soil
singin' 'Hi-ho yippee ti oh' ride em high and down you go

I swore by heck I'd break his neck for the jolt he give my pride
so I threw my noose on that old cayouse and once more took a ride
I turned around, pretty soon I found his head where his tail should be
so I said says I 'Perhaps he's shy. Or he just don't care for me'
singin 'Hi-ho yippee ti oh' ride em high and down you go

In town one day I chanced to stray upon old Sheriff Jim
for a whoop an' a holler an' a counterfeit dollar I sold that nag to him
But when he plants the seat of his pants in Skyballs' leather chair
I'll bet two bits when Skyball quits ol' Jim will not be there
singin 'Hi-ho yippee ti oh' ride em high and down you go
