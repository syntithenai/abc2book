W:Lord Lovel he stood by his own castle gate,
W:A-combing his milk-white steed,
W:When up came Lady Nancy Belle
W:To wish her lover good speed, good speed,
W:To wish her lover good speed.
W:
W:O where are you going, Lord Lovel? she said,
W:O where are you going? cried she:
W:I'm going, my Lady Nancy Belle,
W:Strange countries for to see, see, see
W:Strange countries for to see.
W:
W:How long you'll be gone Lord Lovel? she said;
W:How long you'll be gone? cried she.
W:In a year or two, or three at the most,
W:I'll return to my Lady Nancy, -cy, -cy
W:I'll return to my Lady Nancy.
W:
W:He had not been gone but a year and a day
W:Strange countries for to see,
W:When a strange thought came into his head,
W:He'd go and see Lady Nancy, -cy, -cy,
W:He'd go and see Lady Nancy
W:
W:He rode and he rode on his milk-white steed
W:Till he came to London Town;
W:And there he heard the church bells ring
W:And the people all mourning around, around,
W:And the people all mourning around.
W:
W:Ah! who is dead? Lord Lovel he cried,
W:Ah! Who is dead? cried he.
W:An old woman said: Some lady is dead,
W:They called her Lady Nancy, -cy, -cy
W:They called her Lady Nancy
W:
W:He order'd the grave to be open'd a-wide,
W:And the shroud to be turned a-round;
W:And then he kiss'd her cold clay cheeks
W:Till the tears came trickling down, down, down,
W:Till the tears came trickling down.
W:
W:Lady Nancy she died as it might be today,
W:Lord Lovel he died as tomorrow
W:Lady Nancy she died out of pure, pure grief,
W:Lord Lovel he died out of sorrow, row
W:Lord Lovel he died out of sorrow.
W:
W:The one was buried in the lower chancel,
W:The other was buried in the high'r
W:For one sprang out a gallant red rose,
W:Form the other a gilly flower, flower
W:From the other a gilly flower.
W:
W:And there they grew and turn'd and twined
W:Till they gain'd the chancel top
W:And there they grew and turn'd and twined
W:And tied in a true lover's knot, knot, knot
W:And tied in a true lover's knot.
