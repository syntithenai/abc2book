W:All along down the lane then a maid I did spy
W:And the meadows awoke to the sound of my cry:
W:Well done, etc.

W:So I hastened my horses to walk my her side,
W:And I said to the damsel, "My dear, won't you ride?"
W:Well done, etc.
W:
W:I put my arms round her and gave her a kiss,
W:She said, "You can take me, young man, if you wish."
W:Well done, etc.

W:I spoke to my forehorse, he jingled his bell,
W:And that was his music as no tongue can tell.
