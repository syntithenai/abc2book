W:(translation)
W:One very keen winter, and spring-time of frost,
W:The young lambs were saved, and the old sheep were lost;
W:Oh! rise now, my shepherds, to the mountain up go!
W:For the sheep are all buried deep under the snow.
W:
W:Then Nicholas Raby, when sick he was lying,
W:"In Braid-farrane-fing the sheep are now dying."
W:(Oh! rise now etc)
W:
W:Thus spoke Nicholas Raby as he went up to sleep
W:"My best wishes light on my two thousand sheep."
W:(Oh! rise now etc)
W:
W:"I have sheep that in mountainous passes do roam,
W:Wild sheep in the vales that will never come home"
W:(Oh! rise now etc)
W:
W:Then up rose the the men of Kirk-Lonan with speed;
W:In the pass of Berroll they found the sheep dead.
W:
W:Then the men of Kirk Lonan and Kirk Christ too,
W:Found in Agneash's hollow young lambkins a few.
W:
W:In the front were the wethers, next the rams did appear,
W:And the ewes heavy laden, to make up the rear.
W:
W:I've one sheep for Christmas, two for Lent I'll put by.
W:And two or three more for the time when I die.
