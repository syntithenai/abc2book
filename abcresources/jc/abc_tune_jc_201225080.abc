%% Fifteen years ago I wrote
%% Mary Jane Marsden a tune by way of thanking her for all
%% her hard work in keeping the Francestown dances going.
%% She could retire and go to the Bahamas on 10% of
%% all the ticket money she's collected over the years! This
%% tune says it once again: "Thanks, Mary Jane!"
