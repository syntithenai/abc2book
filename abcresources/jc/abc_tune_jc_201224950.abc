%% I've known Peggy Duesenberry Binney for
%% nearly a hundred years, well anyway, its a long time. She's a great fiddler,
%% and we used to play for Duke Miller in Fitzwilliam years ago. She has
%% her own tune (Peggy's Doozy) in Book 1 (see? I told you it was close to
%% a hundred years!) and now she and her husband* have a little daughter
%% named Sara Helen Binney. So this tune is for you, Sara, with much love
%% from QUACK, and I hope it gets to you, over in Scotland (which is where they
%% all live now.)
