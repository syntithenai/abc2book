w: I raised my head and tried to hear, But on-ly "God" came clear.
W:With song the air was filled
W:When angels brought the word
W:My heart beat fast and thrilled;
W:Such song I never heard!
W:They said in some strange language:
W:"Excelsis! Gloria!"
W:I raised my head and tried to hear,
W:But only "God" came clear.
W:
W:They sang and sang; but what,
W:I could not understand.
W:I answered "We know not
W:Your Latin in this land!
W:If you wish me to listen
W:Please speak to me straight out;
W:You'll find my simple plain Walloon
W:Will fit to any tune."
W:
W:Then, dazed, I heard their news;
W:That Christ the Lord is born!
W:But that His life He'd lose,
W:Perhaps before the morn.
W:If no one brought Him comforts
W:For He was cold and poor;
W:He had a stone beneath His head
W:And straw was all His bed.
W:
W:I called the shepherds, quick!
W:We filled our bags with cake,
W:And cheese and milk so thick,
W:As much as we could take.
W:And following the star's beam
W:We found the little crib.
W:The virgin spoke Walloon and smiled
W:And let us hold the child!
