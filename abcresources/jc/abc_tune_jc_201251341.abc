w:ne-ver could a-gree Be-cause_ that my mas-ter he would love me
W:Father he was a good old man
W:He put me to service when I was very young
W:My mistress and me we never could agree
W:Because that my master he would love me.
W:
W:Well she sent me upstairs to the loft
W:To make up a bed so neat and soft
W:Master followed after with a gay gold ring
W:Saying "Betty have this for your bed making."
W:
W:All through the kitchen and down through the hall
W:All through the parlour among the women all
W:Master followed after with a gay gold ring
W:Saying "Betty have this for your bed making."
W:
W:Mistress come upstairs in a great haste
W:Caught the master there with his arm round my waist
W:From the top to the bottom stair she did him fling
W:Saying "Mister have that for your bedmaking."
W:
W:All through the kitchen and down through the hall
W:All through the parlour among the women all
W:Everybody asked me wherever I had been
W:And they laughed when I said "At the bed making."
W:
W:Mistress she flung me out of the door
W:She called me a nasty cheeky little whore
W:The weather being wet and my clothes being thin
W:How I wished I was back at the bed making.
W:
W:Six month over and seven month past
W:Pretty fair maid grew thick about the waist
W:Her stays wouldn't meet nor her pinafore pin
W:She cried when she thought of the bedmaking.
W:
W:Eight month over and nine month gone
W:Pretty fair maid had a beautiful son
W:She's took him to the church she him christened John
W:And she took him back again to the dear old man.
W:
W:She cursed him through the kitchen and down through the hall
W:Cursed him through the parlour among the women all
W:Saying "If you won't pay me, take your little son John
W:Cos he never cost you nothing but a bed making."
