%% I always enjoy calling the
%% Orzechowskis because usually Russell, age 8, answers the
%% phone, and it's fun to visit with him. Sometimes I try to disguise
%% my voice but he alway seems to know who it is. I'm beginning
%% to wonder if he knows who's calling _before_ he picks it up!? Good
%% luck to you, Russell - I hope you like Russell's Reel. It's a real reel!
