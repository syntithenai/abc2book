%% We all had such a good time at the Ralph Page Legacy Weekend just past.
%% Many thanks especially to Sylvia Miskoe for the musical arrangements
%% so much enjoyed by all concerned, especially the ones producing it!
%% I thought perhaps Ralph might have liked this little ditty;
%% maybe sometimes Ted Sanella will call a dance in memoriam
%% and use this for the music. (that is, if he likes it!)
