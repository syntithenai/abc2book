W:1. Rorate coeli desuper!
W:Heavens, distil your balmy showers;
W:For now is risen the bright Daystar,
W:From the rose Mary, flower of flowers:
W:The clear Sun, whom no cloud devours,
W:Surmounting Phoebus in the east,
W:Is comen of his heavenly towers,
W:Et nobis puer natus est.
W:
W:2. Sinners be glad, and penance do,
W:And thank your Maker heartfully;
W:For he that ye might not come to,
W:To you is comen full humbly,
W:Your soulÃ?Â¨s with his blood to buy,
W:And loose you of the fiend's arrest,
W:And only of his own mercy;
W:Pro nobis puer natus est.
W:
W:3. Celestial fowlÃ?Â¨s in the air,
W:Sing with your notÃ?Â¨s upon height,
W:In firthÃ?Â¨s and in forests fair
W:Be mirthful now at all your might;
W:For passÃ?Â¨d is your dully night;
W:Aurora has the cloudÃ?Â¨s pierced,
W:The sun is risen with gladsome light,
W:Et nobis puer natus est.
W:
W:4.  Sing heaven imperial, most of height,
W:Regions of air make harmony,
W:All fish in flood and fowl of flight
W:Be mirthful and make melody:
W:All Gloria in excelsis cry,
W:Heaven, earth, sea, man, bird, and beast;
W:He that is crowned above the sky
W:Pro nobis puer natus est.
