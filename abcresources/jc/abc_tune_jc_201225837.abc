%% Carol Thompson is a regular at
%% Irish Week at Augusta, and with good reason, as you might expect. She is
%% a marvelous harp player, and regularly makes us all "swoon with delight"
%% over her stellar performance. It's just another good reason to look forward
%% to the annual pilgrimmage to Elkins, WV. You can't surpass that
%% great Augusta Experience. Thanks so much, Carol, for your beautiful
%% music - See you next year!
