T:Seven drunken nights
C:anon.
O:Ireland
N:"Name of this song is 'The seven drunken nights' ... we are only allowed to
N:sing five of them." These are the words that opens the Dubliners' famous
N:recording of this tune. Looking at the two last verses, it's easy to see why
N:they were a bit too raunchy even for them way back in the 1970s.
N:The story about the husband who comes home every night and find his wife in
N:more and more supsicious position and with increasingly unlikely excuses,
N:exists in a number of versions and might be one of the old pan-European song
N:themes. Here at Musica Viva we have a slightly nicer irish version ("Six nights
N:drunk") as well as a Norwegian one. Most variants end up with the husband
N:chasing the faithless wife and her lover from the house, but in "Seven drunken
N:nights" he seems to be fooled even at the very end. Perhaps the alcohol is more
N:important then the wife to him. ;-)
