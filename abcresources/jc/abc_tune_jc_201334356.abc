w:Re-mem-ber me to one who lives there___ For once she was a true love of mine
W:Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Remember me to one who lives there
W:For once she was a true love of mine.
W:
W:Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Without any seam or needlework,
W:And then she'll be a true love of mine.
W:
W:Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Where water ne'er sprung, nor drop of rain fell,
W:And then she'll be a true love of mine.
W:
W:Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Which never bore blossom since Adam was born
W:And then she'll be a true love of mine.
W:
W:O, will you find me an acre of land,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Between the sea foam and the sea sand,
W:Or never be a true love of mine.
W:
W:O, will you plough it with one lamb's horn,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:And sow it all over with one peppercorn,
W:Or never be a true love of mine.
W:
W:O, will you reap it with a sickle of leather,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:And tie it all up with a peacock's feather,
W:Or never be a true love of mine.
W:
W:And when you have done and finished your work,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme;
W:Then come to me for your cambric shirt,
W:And you shall be a true love of mine.
