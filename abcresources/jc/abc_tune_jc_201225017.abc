%% Talk about having a good time!
%% Last Saturday I played down in Greenfield, MA, at the Guiding
%% Star Grange Hall, with Roddy Miller, Fiddle, Bill Tomczak
%% Clarinet, and Bill's wife Susan Kevra doing the calling. I'm glad
%% you can't get arrested for having too much fun, because I'd
%% still be in jail if you could! I think Marcy Rawitscher 
%% would be in there with me, because we rode down
%% together, and she did seem to get along OK!!
