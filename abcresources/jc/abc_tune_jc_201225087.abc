%% 'Way up in the hills of
%% Middlesex, VT, is where Pam Abel and Edie [Mentey]
%% live. There's a small mountain right in back of the
%% house they share, and it sure is a pretty place. Pam's
%% kids, Nisa and Eric Smiley, live there, too, and I bet
%% it won't be long before Eric plays this tune
%% lickety-split on his saxophone. I hope I'm there to hear it!
