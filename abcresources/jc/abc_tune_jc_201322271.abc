C: words: Robert Burns 1791

W: Fareweel to a' our Scottish fame,
W: Fareweel our ancient glory;
W: Fareweel ev'n to the Scottish name,
W: Sae fam'd in martial story.
W: Now Sark rins over Solway sands,
W: An' Tweed rins to the ocean,
W: To mark where England's province stands-
W: Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!
W:
W: What force or guile could not subdue,
W: Thro' many warlike ages,
W: Is wrought now by a coward few,
W: For hireling traitor's wages.
W: The English stell we could disdain,
W: Secure in valour's station;
W: But English gold has been our bane-
W: Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!
W:
W: O would, or I had seen the day
W: That Treason thus could sell us,
W: My auld grey head had lien in clay,
W: Wi' Bruce and loyal Wallace!
W: But pith and power, till my last hour,
W: I'll mak this declaration;
W: We're bought and sold for English gold-
W: Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!
