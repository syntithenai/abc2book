%% So there I was, down in Harlow's Deli this
%% morning, drinking my coffe, and where do you think Peggy McCauley was?
%% She was supposed to be there, too! But no, there she was, way out in
%% Seattle, dancing up a storm and drinking Starbuck's Coffee (hey, that
%% ain't bad!), and we all miss you Peggy. Nelson Town Hall dances
%% haven't been the same since you left!
