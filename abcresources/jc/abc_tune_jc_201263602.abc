w:There are ma-ny chang-es_ in this world;_ Some_ rise while oth-* ers fall
W:Come all you worthy Christian men,
W:That dwell upon this land,
W:Don't spend your time in rioting:
W:Remember you are but man.
W:Be watchful for your latter end;
W:Be ready when you're call'd.
W:There are many changes in this world;
W:Some rise while others fall.
W:
W:Now Job he was a patient man,
W:The richest in the East;
W:When he was brought to poverty,
W:His sorrows soon increased.
W:He bore them all most patiently;
W:From sin he did refrain;
W:He always trusted in the Lord;
W:He soon got rich again.
W:
W:Come all you worthy Christian men,
W:That are so very poor,
W:Remember how poor Lazarus
W:Lay at the rich man's door,
W:While begging of the crumbs of bread
W:That from his table fell.
W:The Scriptures do inform us all
W:That in heaven he doth dwell.
W:
W:The time, alas, it soon will come
W:When parted we shall be;
W:But all the difference it will make
W:Is in joy and misery.
W:And we must give a strict account
W:Of great as well as small:
W:Believe me now, dear Christian friends
W:That God will judge us all
