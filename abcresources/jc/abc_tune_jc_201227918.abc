%% Aunty Lee, of
%% Taunton, MA, is Mrs. George McBride, and so, of course,
%% that makes her Jane (McBride) Orzechowski's (she's Mrs.
%% Peter Orzechowski) sister-in-law. And since the McB's
%% have 4 kids and the O'skis have 5 kids, that makes everybody
%% a cousin or an Aunt or an Uncle or a something to _somebody_,
%% and you don't know it, but we've only just begun this thing!
%% Stay tuned!
