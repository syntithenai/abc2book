W:My Willie is brave, my Willie is tall,
W:My Willie is one that is bonny.

W:If ever he marry any.

W:My Willie is to them huntings gone,
W:I fear he's gone to tarry.
W:He sent a letter back to me
W:Saying he was too young to marry,
W:Saying he was too young to marry.
W:He sent a letter back to me
W:Saying he was too young to marry.

W:Last night I dreamed a dreadful dream,
W:I fear it will bring sorrow.
W:I dreamed I was reaping the heather so green
W:Down by the banks of Ero---
W:
W:'Well, I will read your dream to you,
W:I'll read it with grief and sorrow,
W:That before tomorrow night you hear
W:Of your Willie being drowned in Ero'---
W:
W:I sought him east, I sought him west,
W:I sought him through a valley,
W:And underneath the edge of a rock
W:Was the corpse of my Willie lying---
W:
W:Her hair was full three-quarters long,
W:The colour it was yellow,
W:And around the waist of her Willie she turned
W:To pull him out of Ero---
W:
W:They buried him the very next day,
W:They buried him with grief and sorrow.
W:They buried him the very next day
W:Upon the banks of Ero---
