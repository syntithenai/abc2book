%% Sarah Gregory Smith is from
%% the Boston area, so I don't see her too often. She's a real good
%% caller, and I was so glad when she asked me to play for her over
%% at Richard Herman's Camp Interlochen a while ago. We had such
%% a pleasant evening - a nice supper and then dancing in the beautiful
%% pavilion after. Thanks a lot, Sarah, to you and Dick.
