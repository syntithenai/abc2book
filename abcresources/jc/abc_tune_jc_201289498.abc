w:where_ I love.
W:Come all you maids that live at a distance,
W:Many miles from off your swain,
W:Come and assist me this very moment
W:For to pass away some time.
W:Singing sweetly and completely
W:Songs of pleasure and of love,
W:For my heart is with him altogether,
W:Though I live not where I love.
W:
W:When I sleep I dream about you
W:When I wake I take no rest,
W:For every instant thinking on you,
W:My heart e'er fixed in your breast
W:And although far distance may be assistance
W:From my mind his love to remove
W:But my heart is with him altogether
W:Though I live not where I love
W:
W:All the world shall be one religion
W:All living things shall cease to die
W:Before I prove false unto my jewel
W:Or any way my love deny.
W:The world shall change and be most strange
W:If ever I my mind remove
W:My heart is with him altogether
W:Though I live not where I love.
W:
W:So farewell lads and farewell lasses
W:Now I think I've got my choice
W:I will away to yonder mountains
W:Where I think I hear his voice
W:And if he holloa I will follow
W:Around the world though 'tus so wide
W:For young Thomas he did promise
W:I should be his lawful bride.
