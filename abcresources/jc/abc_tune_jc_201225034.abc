%% Have you ever heard of Rollinsford
%% NH? I never had until Julie showed up, and I found out that's where
%% she lived. It's over near the coast, and it sure must be a nice place
%% if she came from there! Julie loves to dance, and I enjoy seeing
%% her on 1st Saturdays in Peterborough, where Steve Zakon calls
%% each month. I sure hope you like dancing to this tune, Julie!
