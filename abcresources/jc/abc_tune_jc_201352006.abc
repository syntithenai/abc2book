w:Whilst the game-kee-pers lie sle-e-ping
W:O I?ve got a dog and a good dog too
W:And I keeps him in my keeping
W:For to catch those hares that run by night
W:Whilst the gamekeepers lie sleeping
W:
W:My dog and me went out one night
W:For to learn some education
W:Up jumps a hare and away she ran
W:Into a large plantation
W:
W:She had not gone so very far
W:Before something stopped her running,
W:O Aunt! O Aunt!  /One leap from a dog/ she loudly cried,
W:Stop a minute, your Uncle's coming!
W:
W:Oh I took out my little penknife
W:And quickly I did paunch her,
W:She turned out one of the female kind
W:I?m mighty glad I caught her
W:
W:I picked her up and I smoothed her down
W:And I put her in my keeping
W:And I said to my dog ?It's time to be going
W:Whilst the gamekeepers are still sleeping
W:
W:Me and my dog went to the town,
W:And sold the hare to a labouring man
W:And I sold him for a crown.
W:
W:We then went to some public house
W:And there we got well mellow;
W:For we spent that crown and another one too,
W:Don't you think I'm a good-hearted fellow?
