%% Plainfield, VT lies about
%% 10 miles northeast of Montpelier and, unless he's moved,
%% that's where Sid Blum lives. Sid's good at many
%% things: he's a good sound man, a fine fiddler, and he's
%% excellent on the button box. I always enjoy it when
%% circumstance brings us together - we've played a lot
%% of music and I hope in continues. All the best to you, Sid.
