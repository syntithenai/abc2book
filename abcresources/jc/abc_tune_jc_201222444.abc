%% You never in your life heard anything
%% like it when Billy McComiskey winds up that Paulo Soprani
%% button box of his and takes off - He can get a wailing scream out
%% of that thing that'll blow your socks off!  He and Liz and Mick
%% (our instructors for the Irish Music Week at Augusta) gave
%% us such a wonderful concert - Thanks for all your help and hard
%% work, Billy - It sure was a great week!
