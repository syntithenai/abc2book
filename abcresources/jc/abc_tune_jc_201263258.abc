W:"Oh let me in" the soldier cried,
W:Cold, haily, windy night,
W:"Oh let me in," the soldier cried,
W:"For I'll not go back again-o."

W:"My father he watches on the street,
W:My mother the chamber keys do keep,
W:The doors and windows, they do creak,
W:I dare not let you in-o."

W:She's kissed her true love cheek and chin,
W:And she's drawn him between the sheets again,
W:And she opened and she let him in-o.

W:Then she has blessed the rainy night,
W:Cold, haily, windy night,
W:Then she has blessed the rainy night,
W:That she opened and she let him in-o.

W:"Soldier, soldier stay with me,
W:Soldier, soldier won't you marry me?"
W:"Oh no,no,no that ne'er can be
W:So fare thee well forever."

W:Then she has wept for the rainy night,
W:Cold, haily, windy night,
W:Then she has wept for the rainy night,
W:That she opened and she let him in-o.
W:
W:And he's jumped up all out of the bed
W:And he's put his hat all on his head,
W:For she has lost her maidenhead
W:And her mother she heard the din-o.
W:
W:Then she has cursed the rainy night,
W:Cold, haily, windy night,
W:Then she has cursed the rainy night,
W:That she opened and she let him in-o.
