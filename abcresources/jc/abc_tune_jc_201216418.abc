The Howty Towty Lass
For notation Click here
For midi sound Click here
I knew a lass doon Wylam way
As bonny as could be
And tho' she took me fancy
She'd have nowt to do wi' me
And mind she thowt horsel ne muck
For if Aa said Good day!
She stuck up hor nose and she tossed hor heed
And nivvor would look me way.
She stuck up hor nose and tossed hor heed
And nivvor would look me way.
Noo as Aa was just a farmin' lad
Me hands were rough wi' toil
Wi' cleanin byres and leadin muck
To spread upon the soil
And many's the time that she passed by
Tho' nivvor a word was said
Aa knew by her face she thowt that Aa
Was part of the load Aa led.
But womenfolk are kittle cattle
And change from day to day
Me uncle left the farm to me
And cash to myek it pay
But where's the howty towty lass
As thowt Aa'd like to wed
That's hor wi' the coos in her clarty shoes
And a bonny grand wife she's made.
Each time Aa axed hor if she'd wed
For love or for me brass
Aa got a saucy answer from me howty towty lass
But noo we've got a son and heir
She says that he will de
If he's as good as his dad
By gox she must be in love wi' me.

Pot Pies and Puddens

For midi soundClick here
A pitman's wife is nivor dyun
Of that there is nee doot
Whilst some are comin' in from work
there's others gannin' oot
As weel remember as a lad
The feeds there used to be
On Sundays when we aall sat doon
As one big family.
Chorus-
Me poor aad father used to carve
A wallopin joint o'meat
Wi' spuds and sproots by gum we got
As much as we aall cud eat
But best of aall the tasty bites
Aa'll nivver forget by heck
Wer the Pot Pies and the Puddens
That me mother used to myek.
But many years have gyen since then
And now the wife and me
Sit doon on Sundays tiv a chop
That ye can hardly see
Wor dusbin's full of empty tins
And dinner's just a nyem
But nivvor dor Aa mention
Hoo we used to feed at hyem.
Aa tell the wife she's deein fine
And let it gan at that
For if Aa dared to say owt else
By gox, she'd lowse the flat
Howway Aa've poured yor dinner oot
Aa'm sick to hear hor say
Nee wonder that me mind gans back
To many a bygone day.
Coda-
The rowly powly piuddens
The steak and kidney puddens,
Them greet big Yorkshire puddens
That me mother used to myek.

For Midi Sound Click here
Haven't ye heard of the Amble Feast
Hinnies ye've missed a treat
From North to South from West to East
Ivryone there ye'll meet
Lasses and lads have a gala day
As they prance aboot wi' glee
They dance on the green so if ye've not been
Then hurry alang wi'me
Chorus-
Come alang to the feast at Amble
Join the fun it's a regular scramble
Ivrybody will frolic and gambol
Hey nonny nonny and derry down day
Aall the hinnies from Warkworth and Ashington
Blyth and Newbiggin will be there
Such a pushin' and shovin' and jostlin'
Aall good humoured at Amble Fair
Come alang etc.
See the fat wives in the switch back cars
Shriekin' wi' nervous fright
Some others will choose the shuggy shoes
Yellin' with aall thor might
Children gan oon to the roondaboots
An the lads to the coco-nut shies
the lasses mair bold have their fotunes told
While some have hot peas and pies.
Coda.
Feastin' away,happy nad gay
Hey nonny nonny and derry down day.
