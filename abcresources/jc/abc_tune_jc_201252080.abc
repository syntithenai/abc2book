N:  I wrote the second 1/2 first as a B part to a tune that I thought
N: was incomplete and written by another composer. I then discovered
N:he had written a B part so I had to find my own A part. An odd way
N:to write a tune, but it seemed to work. I actually stole the A part
N:from one of my own tunes, transposed the Key then shifted to the
N:minor and then started to revise it till the original tune almost
N:disappeared.
