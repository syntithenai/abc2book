%% When Anita Anderson isn't playing
%% super piano back-up for Rex Blazer's fiddling, she can also
%% be heard singing her heart out in a terrific group called the
%% "'S' Curves" with Wendy and Juanita - Frankly, I'm not sure
%% you West Coasters know how lucky you are! WOW! And then
%% of course, there's Dina, too - I could go on like this for eight
%% more pages, at least! - Do you suppose you can get Rex to play this
%% for you, Anita? I hope so!
