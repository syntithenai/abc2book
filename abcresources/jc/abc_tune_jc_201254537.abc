W:Attend, you sons of high renown,
W:To these few lines which I pen down:
W:I was born to wear a stately crown,
W:And to rule a wealthy nation.
W:I am the man that beat Beaulieu,
W:And Wurmser's will did then subdue;
W:That great Archduke I overthrew;
W:On every plain my men were slain.
W:Grand treasures, too, I did obtain,
W:And got capitulation.
W:
W:I did pursue the Egyptians sore,
W:Till Turks and Arabs lay in gore;
W:The rights of France I did restore
W:So long in confiscation.
W:I chased my foes through mud and mire
W:Till in despair my men did tire.
W:Then Moscow town was set on fire,
W:My men were lost through winter frost;
W:I ne'er before received such blast
W:Since the hour of my creation.
W:
W:To Leipsic town my soldiers fled
W:Monmartre was strewn with Prussian dead,
W:We marched them forth, inveterate,
W:To stop a bold invasion.
W:Farewell, my royal spouse, once more,
W:And offspring great, whom I adore!
W:And may you that great throne restore,
W:That is away, without delay!
W:Those kings of me have made a prey,
W:And caused my lamentation.
