%% The official name for the Conval
%% (Contoocook Valley Regional) School district where I taught for so many
%% years is Supervisory Union #1, and our Superintendent of Schools
%% is Mr. Larry Bramblett. His job is a difficult one and keeps him terribly
%% busy, so even if he were inclined to go to a dance some time, he probably
%% wouldn't have time for it. But he's been awfully good to me, and I
%% just wanted him to have a tune in this book to show my appreciation.
%% Sincere best wishes always to you, Larry, from Mac.
