w: Cry-ing, "Poor old horse_ O poor_ old_ horse."
W:My clothing once was linsey-woolsey fine,
W:My hair unlinkt and my coat it did shine.
W:But now in open fields I'm forc'd for to go,
W:To face the cold winter and the hailstorm and snow.
W:Crying "Poor old horse, O poor old horse."
W:
W:My bait it once was of the best of hay
W:That ever grew in fields or in meadows gay;
W:But now to no such comfort I can get at all.
W:I'm forced for the crop the short grass that grows upon the wall.
W:Crying "Poor old horse, O poor old horse."
W:
W:My days are near an end, and now I must die
W:And at some lownd dike back my weary bowk may lie;
W:I do not greatly mind, for I'm clean done anyhow
W:And my master does not care, for I'm worse than useless now.
W:Crying "Poor old horse, O poor old horse."
W:
W:My skin unto the huntsman I freely do give
W:My flesh unto the hounds I also bequeath
W:Likewise my body stout, that's gone o'er so many miles
W:Over hedge, over ditches, over gates and over stiles.
W:Crying "Poor old horse, O poor old horse."
