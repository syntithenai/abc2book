Q:400
N:When we played at The Lemon Tree in Aberdeen once our
N:agent came with us and we'd been travelling for some time.
N:We checked into the hotel, then the band went to do a sound
N:check while our agent had a shower, saying he'd meet us at
N:the venue. He didn't turn up for a very long time. When he
N:finally did he explained that he'd got nicely cleaned up, but as
N:he opened the door to come into the venue a seagull shit right
N:down him - hair, shoulders, knees and toes - so he'd had to
N:return to the hotel and go through the whole process once
N:more.
