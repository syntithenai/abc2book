W:I met my girl at Woolwich Pier
W:Beneath the big cranes standing
W:And oh, the love I felt for her
W:It passed all understanding
W:
W:Took her sailing on the river
W:    Flow sweet river, flow
W:London town was mine to give her
W:    Sweet Thames flow softly
W:
W:Made the Thames into a crown
W:    Flow sweet river, flow
W:Made a brooch of Silver town
W:    Sweet Thames flow softly
W:
W:At London Yard I held her hand
W:At Blackwall Point I faced her
W:At the Isle of Dogs I kissed her mouth
W:And tenderly embraced her
W:
W:Heard the bells of Greenwich ringing,  Flow  . . .
W:All the time I had was singing,  Sweet Thames  . . .
W:
W:Lighthouse Reach I gave her there,  Flow  . . .
W:As a ribbon for her hair,  Sweet Thames  . . .
W:
W:From Putney Bridge to Nine Elms Reach
W:We cheek to cheek were dancing
W:Her necklace made of London Bridge
W:Her beauty was enhancing
W:
W:Kissed her once again at Wapping,  Flow  . . .
W:After that there was no stopping,  Sweet Thames  . . .
W:
W:Gave her Hampton Court to twist,  Flow  . . .
W:Into a bracelet for her wrist,  Sweet Thames  . . .
W:But now alas the tide has changed
W:My love she has gone from me
W:And winter's frost has touched my heart
W:And put a blight upon me
W:
W:Creeping fog is on the river,  Flow  . . .
W:Sun and moon and stars gone with her,  Sweet Thames  . . .
W:
W:Swift the Thames runs to the sea,  Flow  . . .
W:Bearing ships and part of me,  Sweet Thames  . . .
