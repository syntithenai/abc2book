w:A-rise, a-rise, you slum-ber-ing sleep-er A-rise, a-rise,_ 'tis al-most_ day Go o-pen your doors, your doors and win-dows And hear_ what your_ true love_ doth say
W:Arise, arise, you slumbering sleeper
W:Arise, arise, 'tis almost day
W:Go open your doors, your doors and windows
W:And hear what your true love doth say
W:
W:Oh who is this that knocks at my window
W:That speaks my name so familiarly?
W:'Tis James, 'tis James, your own true lover
W:That wants to speak one word to thee
W:
W:Go away from my window, you'll waken my father
W:He's lying now a-taking his rest
W:And in his hand he holds a weapon
W:To kill the one that my heart loves best
W:
W:Go away from my window, you'll waken my mother
W:Such tales of love she scorns to hear
W:You?d better go court, go court some other
W:She kindly whispered in my ear
W:
W:I won't go court, go court some other
W:By what I say I mean no harm
W:I want to win you from your mother
W:A rest you in a true love's arms
W:
W:O down in yon valley there grows a green willow
W:I wish it were across my breast
W:It might cut off all grief and sorrow
W:And set my troubled mind at rest
