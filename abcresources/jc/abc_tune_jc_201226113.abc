%% Deanna Stiles was
%% the driving force behind a band called the Bob-o-links, and
%% I guess you could say that Bob Shannahan was a driving force
%% too, because, you see, he was the piano player, and you know
%% how _they_ are - well, anyway here is a tune for you, Bob, with
%% very best wishes always from Bob McQ.
