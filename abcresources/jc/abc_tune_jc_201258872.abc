%   When first received with a batch of fine tunes noted down by our
% unselfish friend Francis E. Walsh from the playing of clever San
% Francisco musicians, the foregoing reel under a slightly different
% name was recognized as a variant of "Rakish Paddy" previously
% printed in The Music of Ireland, and O'Neill's Dance Music of
% Ireland. Another variant named "Sporting Pat" is to be found in
% O'Neill's Irish Music for Piano or Violin. Under the circumstances,
% another variant seemed superfluous, but coming from such a
% famous fiddler as John Kelly of Roscommon, it has been cheerfully
% welcomed to our pages.
%   A favorite with all capable pipers and fiddlers of our acquaintance
% for many years, the tune under any of its recognized names does
% not appear in the Bunting, Petrie or Joyce publications. As
% "Caper Fey" it was printed in Bremner's Second Collection of Scots
% Reels or Country Dances, London 1768; yet omitted from The Glen
% Collection of Scottish Dance Music, Edinburgh 1891.
%   Most Highland Bagpipe note books include a suitable setting of the
% tune under the correct title as above, in Gaelic and English.

% [jc 2016-9-17] Bar 7 had "=3D" before the F, and a number of cases
% of "=20" in the comments. I ran it all through my quoted-printable
% decoder, converting the "=3D" to just '='. I found a copy of the
% 2nd edition at
%   https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044040672529;view=1up;seq=150
% and on page 142, there's a version (with piano bass) that has the
% =F in bar 7, with a Dm chord in the bass. It's tune X:269 in this
% edition, so it might not be the same in the edition that Paul Kinder
% used for his transcription. It also has the segno sign, which I
% added above.
