%% For Renn Tolman, of
%% Homer, Alaska. Born with a silver pennywhistle
%% in his mouth, Renn grew up in Nelson, N.H., where
%% he learned to play jigs and reels at the feet of his
%% dad, Newt Tolman, who was a highly-acclaimed flute
%% player throughout New England. Hope you like this tune, Renn!
