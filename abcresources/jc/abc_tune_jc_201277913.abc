% is not related.

% However .. I think I've found your man:  Augustus F. French, Co. F, 15 Vermont Infantry, musician.
% He's the only one I could see who fits your criteria.

% Assuming this is the right man, I believe he is one Augustus Fordyce French, b. 07 FEB 1828
% Cabot,Washington Co., Vermont, son of Lyndon Smith French and Annie Elizabeth Farnham.  Augustus
% F. French applied for a pension in 1887 when he was living in New York.  This appears to be the
% Augustus French who was enumerated in the 1880 census (Long Island, Queens, New York City-Greater,
% New York, Astoria, NA Film Number T9-0918 Page Number 130B) with wife Hannah, and children Julia
% and Agustus.  He was a cabinet maker at that time.
