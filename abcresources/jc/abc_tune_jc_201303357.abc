(E G) | B2 B G | B2 B (c/d/) | (e2{c}) B  G| (F/HE3/)
w:I* came to the place where the* lone pil-grim lay,
(E G) | B2 B B | g2 f e | Hf2
w:And* pen-sive-ly stood by the tomb,
(g f) | e2 c e | B2 B (c/d/) | (e2{c}) B G| (F/ HE3/)
w:When* in a low whis-per I* heard some-thing say,*
(E G) | B2 B G | (B3/ c/) e e | e4 |
w:"How* sweet-ly I sleep* here a-lone."
W:I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay,
W:And pensively stood by the tomb,
W:When in a low whisper I heard someone say,
W:"How sweetly I sleep here alone."
W:
W:"The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar,
W:And gathering storms may arise,
W:Yet calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul
W:The tears are all wiped from my eyes.
W:
W:"The cause of my master compelled me from home,
W:I bade my companions farewell;
W:I blessed my dear children who now for me mourn,-
W:In far distant regions they dwell.
W:
W:"I wandered an exile and stranger from home,
W:No kindred or relative nigh;
W:I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
W:My soul flew to mansions on high.
W:
W:"O tell my companion and children most dear,
W:To weep not for me now I'm gone;
W:The same hand that led me through scenes most severe,
W:Has kindly assisted me home.
W:
W:"And there is a crown that doth glitter and shine,
W:That I shall for everyone wear;
W:Then turn to the Savior, his love's all divine,
W:All you that would dwell with me there."
