w:"Oh! of all the sorts of a Col--in, why a sail--or for me!"
W:As I walked through Bristol City, I heard a fair maid sing,
W:In behalf of her sailor, her country and her king;
W:And oh, she sang so sweetly, and so sweetly sang she
W:"Oh! of all the sorts of a Colin, why a sailor for me!"
W:
W:"You may know my jolly sailor, wheresomede'er he does rove,
W:He's so neat in his behaviour, and so true to his love;
W:His teeth are white as ivory, his cheeks like the damask rose,
W:So you may know my jolly sailor, wheresomede'er he goes.
W:
W:"For your sailors are men of honour, and men of courage bold,
W:If they go to fight their enemies they are not to be controuled;
W:If they get on board a man of war where the thundering cannons roar,
W:They venture their lives for gold, and spend it freely on shore."

W:"Come, come, my pretty Polly, come sit theee down by me,
W:For now my pretty Molly, you and I will agree;
W:For my Molly is an angel, all dressed in willow green,
W:And she be like any lady, or a beautiful queen.
W:
W:"Pretty Poll has got a colour like the roses in June,
W:And she plays upon the hipsicols a melodious fine tune;
W:Her lips are red as rubies, her eyes as black as sloes,
W:So you may know my pretty Polly wheresomede'er she goes.
W:
W:"I'll build my love a castle on yonder high ground,
W:Where no lord nor yet a monarch can e'er pull it down;
W:For the King he can but love his Queen, and my dear I can do the same;
W:And you shall be my shepherdess, and I'll be your swain."
