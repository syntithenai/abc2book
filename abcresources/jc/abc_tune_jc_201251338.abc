w:I have brought you a branch of_ May
W:I've been rambling all the night,
W:And the best part of the day;
W:And now I am returning back again,
W:I have brought you a branch of May.
W:
W:A branch of May, my dear, I say,
W:Before your door I stand,
W:It's nothing but a sprout, but it's well budded out,
W:By the work of our Lord's hand.
W:
W:Go down in your dairy and fetch me a cup,
W:A cup of your sweet cream,*
W:And, if I should live to tarry in the town,
W:I will call on you next year.
W:
W:The hedges and the fields they are so green,
W:As green as any leaf,
W:Our Heavenly Father waters them
W:With His Heavenly dew so sweet.
W:
W:When I am dead and in my grave,
W:And covered with cold clay,
W:The nightingale will sit and sing,
W:And pass the time away.
W:
W:Take a Bible in your hand,
W:And read a chapter through,
W:And, when the day of Judgment comes,
W:The Lord will think on you.
W:
W:I have a bag on my right arm,
W:Draws up with a silken string,
W:Nothing does it want but a little silver
W:To line it well within.
W:
W:And now my song is almost done,
W:I can no longer stay,
W:God bless you all both great and small,
W:I wish you a joyful May.
