%% Zebadiah K-Roe is from Greenville,
%% HN.H., and I got to know him because his dad, Gene, tunes
%% my piano. Zeb's a dandy young man, full of music, and maybe
%% some day you'll play this tune on your flute, Zeb!
%% Much love to you, from Bob--

%% Note: The 1st Setting fits both flute and fiddle; the 2nd Setting won't fit the flute,
%% but I thought it might sound good on the fiddle in the lower register - Try it and see!
