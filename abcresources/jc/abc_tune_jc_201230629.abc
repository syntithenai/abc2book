%% When Jackson Reed was
%% pretty small, he used to come to local contra-dances
%% and keep me company when I was playing the piano.
%% Nowadays, he's a six-footer, and lives up in Alaska.
%% AK or no, Jackson, I still think you need a tune, so
%% here it is, with all good wishes to you and your
%% mom, Carol, from Bob--
