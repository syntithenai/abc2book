%W:Farewell to Old Bedford, I’m bound for to leave you
%W:Likewise those pretty girls I nevermore shall see;
%W:My portion is small but I truly confess it
%W:What little I have, it is all my own.

W:2.~Well might I have enjoyed it, all in pleasure
W:If my cruel parents had left me alone;
W:I will drown away sorrow in a full-flowing bumper
W:I will drown away sorrow in a bottle of wine.

W:3.~Eight drams a bottle is, and I don’t care for folly

W:4.~Eight drams a bottle is, and I don’t care for folly
W:I play on my fiddle and dance all the time,
W:My fingers are frozen, My bow it needs rosin
W:My sound post is down, and my bridge it won’t stand.
