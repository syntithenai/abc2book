%% Fred and Marilyn Richardson live over in
%% Jaffrey, NH, and they've been dancing as far back as I can remember -
%% They have been loyal supporters over many years, dancing with
%% Ralph and then later with Duke at all those Fitzwilliam dances
%% (Thanks, Jim Kennedy!) - Did you know Duke also called Friday nights
%% in the summer at the Peterborough Golf Club - for about ten years? and
%% pairs of shoes the Richardsons have worn out, just from
%% the dances?! Much love to you both - Keep it up!
