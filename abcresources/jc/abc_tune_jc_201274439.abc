W:
W:She mounted on her milk-white steed,
W:And he on his dapple gray,
W:And forth from her father's house they went,
W:Before the break of day.
W:
W:They rode and rode and rode away
W:Until they came to the sea,
W:And here they pulled their horses up
W:Hard by a willow tree.
W:
W:"Now get thee down, my pretty Pollee,
W:And harken unto me,-
W:Six pretty maidens I've drownded here,
W:And you the seventh shall be.
W:
W:"Take off, take off that silken gown,
W:And give it unto me,-
W:A silken gown is much too fine
W:To rot in the salt sea."
W:
W:"O turn about, O turn about,
W:And face the willow tree,-
W:While I take off the silken gown
W:And give it unto thee."
W:
W:He turned about, he turned about,
W:And faced the willow tree,-
W:She took him in her lily-white arms,
W:And threw him into the sea.
W:
W:"Lie there, lie there, my false lover,
W:Lie there instead of me,-
W:If six pretty maidens you've drownded here,
W:Go bear them company!"
W:
W:She mounted on her milk-white steed,
W:And led the dapple gray,
W:And back she went to her father's house,
W:Before the break of day.
W:
W:The first she saw was the little parrot,-
W:"O where have you been from me?
W:O where have you been in the early morn,-
W:O where have you been from me?"
W:
W:"O say no more, my little parrot,-
W:O say no more to me,
W:And I'll give thee a golden cage,
W:To hang on the chestnut tree!"
W:
W:The next to speak was her mother dear,-
W:"O where have you been from me?"
W:"I've been to church in the early morn,
W:To say a prayer for thee."
