W:'Tis of a fair damsel in London did dwell,
W:A-waiting in her beauty, which none there could excel.
W:Her master and her mistress she servÃ?Â¨d seven year,
W:And what follows after you soon shall quickly hear.
W:
W:She packed up her box with her red cloak and gown,
W:She packed up her box all to leave London town,
W:Her red cloak and gown, and the rest of her clothes,
W:And with her box upon her head from service she goes.
W:
W:She put her box upon her head, and carried it along,
W:The first that she met with was an able man and strong,
W:He said, My pretty fair maid, pray will you come with me,
W:And I'll put you in a nearer way across this country?"
W:
W:He took her by the hand, and he led to a lane,
W:He said, "My pretty fair maid, I'll tell you plump and plain,
W:Deliver up your money without fear or strife,
W:Or else this very moment I'll take away your life."
W:
W:The tears from her eyes like two fountains did flow,
W:Saying, "Where shall I wander, or where shall I go?"
W:And while this young fellow was feeling for his knife,
W:This beautiful damsel she took away his life.
W:
W:She put her box all on her head, and with it trudged along,
W:The next that she met was a noble gentleman,
W:He said, "My pretty fair maid, where are you going so late,
W:Or what was that noise that I heard at yonder gate?"
W:
W:"That box you carry upon your head to yourself does not belong,
W:To your master or your mistress you have done something wrong,
W:To your master or your mistress you have done something ill,
W:For one moment from trembling you cannot keep still."
W:
W:"This box upon my head to myself it does belong,
W:To my master and my mistress I have done nothing wrong,
W:To my master and my mistress I have done nothing ill,
W:But I fear in my heart that a young man I did kill."
W:
W:"He demanded my money, and I soon let him know,
W:For while he was fumbling I proved his overthrow;"
W:She took him by the hand and led him to the place
W:Where this able young fellow lay bleeding on his face.
W:
W:This gentleman got off his horse to see what he had got;
W:He had three loaded pistols, some powder, and some shot,
W:Beside three loaded pistols, some powder, and some ball,
W:A knife, and a whistle some robbers for to call.
W:
W:He put the whistle to his mouth, and he blew it loud and shrill,
W:Then four stout and able fellows came tripping o'er the hill;
W:This gentleman shot one of them, and that most speedily,
W:And this beautiful young damsel she shot the other three.
W:
W:When this noble gentleman saw all the robbers dead,
W:He took the damsel by the hand, and thus to her he said,
W:"I'll take you for my own bride, for the deed that you have done,
W:In taking of your own part, and firing off your gun."
