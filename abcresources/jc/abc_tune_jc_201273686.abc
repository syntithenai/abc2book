H: Words to the song are not included as they were posted
   previously to the MDDL. There are nuances to the dance not
   in this notation but obvious in the video tape which Norman
   Stanfield (who requested the notation for this) has. Thanks
   and/or apologies to Bristol Morris. If I am in error I'm
   sure they will let me know. Notice how I can ramble on
   because abc2mtex will ignore everything in this field.
