%% Eileen Carson is one of the greats
%% in my life, and if you're ever had the pleasure of watching the Fiddle
%% Puppets dance, then she is in yours, too. Eileen heads up that wonderful
%% clogging group, and every year I am lucky enough to be at Augusta to
%% enjoy their marvelous performance. Thanks a million, Eileen, forall
%% the fun you have given us over the years - it's a real treat to watch
%% your feet! (And you, too, my dear - you're fabulous!)
