W:'Twas early I walked on a midsummer morning,
W:The fields and the meadows were decked and gay,
W:The small birds were singing, the woodlands a-ringing,
W:'Twas early in the morning, at breaking of day,
W:I will play on my pipes, I will sing thee my lay!
W:It is early in the morning, at breaking of day.
W:
W:O hark! and O hark! to the nightingales wooing,
W:The lark is aloft piping shrill in the air.
W:In every green bower the turtle-doves cooing,
W:The sun is just gleaming, arise up my fair!
W:Arise, love, arise! none fairer I spie
W:Arise, love, arise! O why should I die?
W:
W:Arise, love, arise! go and get your love posies,
W:The fairest of flowers in garden that grows,
W:Go gather me lilies, carnations and roses,
W:I'll wear them with thoughts of the maiden I chose
W:I stand at the door, pretty love, full of care,
W:O why should I languish so long in despair?
W:
W:O why my love, O why, should I banished be from thee?
W:O why should I see my own chosen no more?
W:O why look your parents so slightingly on me?
W:It is all for the rough ragged garments I wore,
W:But dress me with flowers, I'm as gay as a king,
W:I'm glad as a bird when my carol I sing.
W:
W:Arise, love, arise! in song and in story,
W:To rival thy beauty was never a may,
W:I will play thee a tune on my pipes of ivory,
W:It is early in the morning, at breaking of day,
W:I will play on my pipes, I will sing thee my lay!
W:It is early in the morning, at breaking of day.
