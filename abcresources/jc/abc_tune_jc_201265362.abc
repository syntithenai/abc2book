W:Chorus:
W:Oh the cropper lads for me,
W:The gallant lads for me,
W:Who with lusty stroke the shear frame broke,
W:The cropper lads for me.

W:Who though the special still advance
W:And soldiers nightly round us prance,
W:The cropper lads still lead the dance
W:With hatchet, pike and gun.
W:
W:And night be night when all is still
W:And the moon is hid behind the hill,
W:We forward march to do our will
W:With hatchet, pike and gun.
W:
W:Great Enoch still shall lead the van,
W:Stop him who dare, stop him who can.
W:Press forward every gallant man
W:With hatchet, pike and gun.
