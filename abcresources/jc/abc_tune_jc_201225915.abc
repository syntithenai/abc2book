%% I've known Jerry Weene for years and
%% more years - at least since the blue Canterbury record and probably before - Jerry's
%% into fiddle sales and service (as well as being a real fine fiddler himself), and he has a
%% shop in Waltham, MA, called Artisan's Violin. Sometimes before long a bunch of us
%% are going to have a Canterbury concert down there, and it's going to be real nice
%% to play music with you again, Jerry -- Best wishes always to you --
