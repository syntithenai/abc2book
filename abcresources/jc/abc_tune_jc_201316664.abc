W:4.The Lord has promised good to me, His word my hope secures;
W:  He will my shield and pardon be, As long as life endures.
W:5.Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, And mortal life shall cease,
W:  I shall possess, within the veil, A life of joy and peace.
W:6.The earth shall soon dissolve like snow, The sun forbear to shine;
W:  But God, who call'd me here below, Will be for ever mine.
