W:One mornin' Tim was rather full, his head felt heavy which made him shake.
W:He fell from a ladder and he broke his skull, and they carried him home his corpse to wake.
W:They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet, and laid him out upon the bed,
W:With a gallon of whisky at his feet, and a barrel of porter at his head.
W:    Chorus
W:His friends assembled at the wake, and Mrs Finnegan called for lunch.
W:First they brought in tay and cake, then pipes, tobacco and whisky punch.
W:Biddy O'Brien began to cry, "Such a nice clean corpse did you ever see?
W:Tim Mavourneen, why did you die?" "Arrah, hold your gob," said Paddy McGhee.
W:    Chorus
W:Then Mattie O'Connor took up the job, "Oh, Biddy," says she,"you're wrong I'm sure."
W:Biddy gave her a belt in the gob, and left her sprawling on the floor.
W:Then the war did soon engage, 'twas woman to woman and man to man,
W:Shelelaigh law was all the rage, and a row and a ruction soon began.
W:    Chorus
W:Then Mickey Maloney ducked his head, when a noggin of whisky flew at him.
W:It missed, and falling on the bed, the liquor scattered over Tim.
W:Tim revives - see how he rises. Timothy rising from the bed,
W:Said "Whirl your whisky around like blazes. Devil take my soul, do you thik I'm dead?"
W:    Chorus
