W:As I was a walking one morning last autumn
W:I've overheard some noble fox hunting
W:Between some noble men and the Duke of Wellington
W:So early before the day was dawning

W:chorus
W:There was Dido, Bendigo, Gentry he was there'o
W:Traveller he's never looked behind him
W:There was Countess, Rover, Bonny Lass and Jover
W:These were the hounds that could find him
W:
W:Well the first fox being young and his trials just beginning
W:He's made straight way for his cover
W:He's run up yon highest hill and gone down yon lowest dell
W:Thinking that he'd find his freedom there forever
W:
W:Well the next fox being old and his trial past a dawning
W:He's made straight way for the river
W:Well the fox he has jumped in but the hounds jumped after him
W:It was traveller who strided him forever
W:
W:Well they've run across the plain but they've soon returned again
W:The fox nor the hounds never failing
W:It's been just twelve months today that I heard the squire say
W:Hark forward me bonny hounds forever
