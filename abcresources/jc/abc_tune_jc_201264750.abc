w:  home-brewed, brown bread, And a cot-tage well thatch'd with straw.
W:In the days of yore, there sat at his door,
W:An old farmer and thus sang he,
W:'With my pipe and my glass, I wish every class
W:On the earth were as well as me!'
W:For he envied not any man his lot,
W:The richest, the proudest, he saw,
W:For he had home-brew'd- brown bread,
W:And a cottage well thatch'd with straw,
W:     A cottage well thatch'd with straw,
W:     And a cottage well thatch'd with straw,
W:     For he had home-brew'd, brown bread,
W:     And a cottage well thatch'd with straw.

W:'My dear old dad this snug cottage had,
W:And he got it, I'll tell you how.
W:He won it, I wot, with the best coin got,
W:With the sweat of an honest brow.
W:Then says my old dad, be careful lad
W:To keep out of the lawyer's claw.
W:So you'll have home-brew'd-brown bread,
W:And a cottage well thatch'd with straw.
W:     A cottage well thatch'd with straw & c:
W:
W:The ragged, the torn, from my door I don't turn,
W:But I give them a crust of brown;
W:And a drop of good ale, my lad, without fail,
W:For to wash the brown crust down.
W:Tho' rich I may be, it may chance to me,
W:That misfortune should spoil my store,
W:So-I'd lack home-brew'd-brown bread,
W:And a cottage wel thatch'd with straw,
W:     A cottage well thatch'd with straw, & c:
W:
W:'Then in frost and snow to the Church I go,
W:No matter the weather how.
W:And the service and prayer that I put up there,
W:Is to Him who speeds the plough.
W:Sunday saints, i'feck, who cheat all the week,
W:With a ranting and a canting jaw,
W:Not for them is my home-brew'd,- brown bread,
W:And my cottage well thatch'd with straw.
W:     My cottage well thatch'd with straw
W:     My cottage well thatch'd with straw.
W:     Not for them is my home-brew'd- brown bread,
W:     And my cottage well thatch'd with straw.
