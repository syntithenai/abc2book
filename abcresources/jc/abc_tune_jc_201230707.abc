%% Sam (Samantha!) is
%% a nifty young woman. She's married to Curtis Dude,
%% (who is also nifty!) and they work together at tree
%% removal. Sometimes she comes to the Monday Night
%% Dance in Nelson, and she always comes up and says
%% "Hi"" to me. She's a sweetheart. And a big "Hi" to you,
%% too, Sam! (and "Hi" Curtis, too!)
