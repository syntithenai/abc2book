W:It was late last night when the squire came home
W:And asking for his lady.
W:The only answer that he got,
W:"She's gone with the Gypsy Davey,
W:She's gone with the Gypsy Davey."
W:
W:"Go saddle for me my buckskin horse
W:And a hundred dollar saddle
W:Point out to me their wagon tracks
W:And after them I'll travel."
W:
W:Well he had not rode to the midnight moon
W:When he saw the campfire gleaming
W:He heard the notes of the big guitar
W:And the noise of the gypsies singing.
W:
W:"Have you forsaken your house and home?
W:Have you forsaken your baby?
W:Have you forsaken your husband dear
W:To go with the Gypsy Davey?"
W:
W:"Yes, I've forsaken my husband dear
W:To go with the Gypsy Davey,
W:And I've forsaken my mansion high
W:But not my blue-eyed baby."
W:
W:"Take off, take off your buckskin gloves
W:Made of Spanish leather,
W:Give to me your lilywhite hand
W:And we''ll ride home together."
W:
W:"No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves
W:Made of Spanish leather.
W:I'll go my way from day to day
W:And sing with the Gypsy Davey."
