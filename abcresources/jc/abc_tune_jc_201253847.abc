W:I saw a sweet maiden trip over the lea,
W:Her eyes were as loadstones attracting of me.
W:Her cheeks were the roses, that Cupid lurks in,
W:With a bonny blue kerchief tied under her chin.
W:
W:O where are you going my fair pretty maid?
W:O whither so swift through the dewdrops? I said,
W:I go to my mother, kind sir, for to spin.
W:O the bonny blue kerchief tied under her chin.
W:
W:Why wear you that kerchief tied over your head?
W:'Tis the country girl's fashion, kind sir, then she said.
W:And the fashion young maidens will always be in
W:So I wear the blue kerchief tied under my chin.
W:
W:To kiss her sweet lips then I sought to begin,
W:O nay Sir! she said, 'ere a kiss you would win,
W:Pray show me a ring, of gold most thin,
W:O slyest blue kerchief tied under the chin!
W:
W:Why wear a blue kerchief, sweet maiden, I said,
W:Because the blue colour is one not to fade,
W:As a sailor's blue jacket who fights for the king.
W:So's my bonny blue kerchief tied under the chin.
W:
W:The love that I value is certain to last,
W:Not fading and changing, but ever set fast,
W:That only the colour, my love sir to win,
W:So goodbye from the kerchief tied under the chin.
