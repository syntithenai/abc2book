w:Sev-en years I'm trans-*port-ed you know*
W:Here's adieu to all judges and juries!
W:Here's adieu to you baliffs also!
W:Seven years you've parted me from my true love,
W:Seven years I'm transported you know.
W:
W:"Oh! Polly, I'm going for to leave you,
W:For seven long years, love, or more;
W:But the time it won't seem but one moment,
W:When I think on the girl I adore.
W:
W:Going to a strange country don't grieve me,
W:Nor leaving old England behind;
W:But it's all for the sake of my Polly love,
W:And a-leaving my comrades behind.
W:
W:And if ever I return from the ocean,
W:Stores of riches I will bring you, my dear;
W:It's all for the sake of my Polly love,
W:I'll cross the salt seas without fear."
W:
W:How hard is the place of confinement,
W:Which keeps me from my heart's delight;
W:Cold chains and cold irons all around me,
W:And a plank for my pillow at night.
W:
W:Oftentimes I have wished that some eagle,
W:Would lend me her wings for to to fly,
W:I would fly to the arms of my Polly love,
W:Once more in her bosom to lie.
