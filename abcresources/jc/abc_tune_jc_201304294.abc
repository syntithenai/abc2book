w: til_ he_ came to_ love-_ ly_ Joan.
W:"Good morning to you, my pretty maid".
W:"Twice good morning, kind sir", she said.
W:"Are you going a-milking all alone?"
W:"Oh yes", replied sweet lovely Joan.
W:
W:Then he pulled out a purse of gold,
W:And said "pretty maid all this behold.
W:All this I'll give with me to wed."
W:Her cheeks they blushed like roses red.
W:
W:"Now, noble knight, I pray you forbear,
W:But don't you make remarks on me.
W:Tomorrow night I'm going to be wed,
W:And my love shall enjoy my maidenhead."
W:
W:'Twas then he made a solumn vow,
W:That he would wed, whether or no;
W:This he said to frighten Joan,
W:As she sat milking all alone.
W:
W:"Give me the gold, sir, in my hand,
W:And I will be at your command;
W:For that will be more good to me
W:Than twenty husband, sir", said she.
W:
W:Whilst he was looking for a bed,
W:She mounted on her milk-white steed.
W:He called, he called, 'twas all in vain;
W:She never looked back [at him] again.
W:
W:She did not think herself quite safe
W:Until she reached her true love's gate;
W:She robbed him of his steed and gold
W:And left him the empty purse to hold.
W:
W:Now it pleased her lover to the heart
W:To see how well she played her part.
W:"Tomorrow morning we'll be wed,
W:And I will be the knight instead."
