%% Last October, New England
%% Tradition went to the Big Apple with caller David
%% Millstone. We played for a dance in the Metropolitan
%% Duane Church, corner of 13th St. and 7th Ave. Afterwards, we
%% went to Steve Howe's house and spent a real nice comfortable
%% night. It sure was good of you to put us up, Steve. Thanks loads!
