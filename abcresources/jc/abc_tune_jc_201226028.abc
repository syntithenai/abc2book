%% Here's a real old-fashioned
%% Irish jig for Nicki (Sullivan) Noonan to dance to when she's
%% running around the house being a good mummy to Ashley
%% and a lovely wife to James - Nicki's always been a favorite
%% of mine since her high school days at Conval, and so I'm glad
%% you have your own tune, Nicki - with much love from MAC
