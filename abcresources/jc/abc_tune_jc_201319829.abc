X:1
T:Old Tom of Oxford (T tells us that this is the title - you can leave this line blank, but for good form don't leave it out or the computer - in the case of an ABC decoder - would have problems reading the tune)
K:Dmaj (This is the key signature and - really if we're being pernickety - should come last in the header, right before the tune starts)
M:4/4 (The time signature)
L:1/4 (The default length of any note in the piece - here we are told that the default length, unless otherwise stated, is a crotchet - if it had been a quaver, it would have said 1/8).
