W:She how she gathers, binds it, she folds it in her arms,
W:Then she gives it to some waggoner to fill the farmer's barns.
W:(Chorus:)
W:With the good old leathern bottle, and the beer it shall be brown,
W:We'll reap and skip together, boys, till bright Phoebus does go down.

W:Now harvest's done and ended, the corn secure from harm,
W:All for to go to market, boys, we must thresh in the barn.
W:(Chorus:)
W:With the good old leathern bottle, and the beer it shall be brown,
W:We'll reap and skip together, boys, till bright Phoebus does go down.

W:Here's a health to all you farmers, likewise to all you men,
W:I wish you health and happiness till harvest comes again.

W:With the good old leathern bottle, and the beer it shall be brown,
W:We'll reap and skip together, boys, till bright Phoebus does go down.
