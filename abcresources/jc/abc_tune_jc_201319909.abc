w:There was once a man with a dou-ble chin,

w:Who per-formed with skill on a vi-o-lin:
 F3/2E/ |D2 D2 D2 F3/2G/ |A2 A2 A2
w: And he played in time and he played in tune,

w:And he would-n't play an-y-thing but 'Old Zip Coon'
W:There once was a man with a double chin,
W:Who played with skill on a violin:
W:And he played in time and he played in tune,
W:But he never played anything but 'Old Zip Coon'.
W:'Old Zip Coon' he played all day,
W:Until he drove his friends away;
W:He played all night by the light of the moon
W:And wouldn't play anything but 'Old Zip Coon'.
W:
W:So the neighbours said "Will you kindly play
W:'Nellie Bly' or 'Where are the Flowers in May'?"
W:Any tune will do if its not that tune,"
W:But he wouldn't play anything but 'Old Zip Coon'.
W:'Old Zip Coon' he played all night,
W:Until the owls and bats took flight;
W:His friends all begged for a different tune,
W:But he wouldn't play anything but 'Old Zip Coon'.
W:
W:So they took that man with the double chin,
W:All his worldly goods and the violin.
W:And they shipped him off to a foreign shore
W:Where the natives had never heard the tune before.
W:'Old Zip Coon' he played all day:
W:He played until the natives ran away:
W:He played and played by the light of the moon
W:Till they wished they had never heard of 'Old Zip Coon'.
W:
W:They have left him there by the deep blue sea,
W:Where he lives alone in a hollow tree;
W:And he played that tune and it never ends,
W:So it isn't surprising that he has no friends.
W:'Old Zip Coon' he plays all day,
W:There's no one left to run away;
W:And still he thinks it's a beautiful tune,
W:And that is the history of 'Old Zip Coon'.
