w:      To earn a small mite for my lodg-ing at night, God help me, for now I'm cast out!
W:I'm a man that's in trouble and sorrow,
W:That once was light-hearted and gay;
W:Not a coin in this world can I borrow,
W:Since my own I have squander'd away
W:I once wronged my father and mother,
W:Till they turned me out from their door,
W:To beg, starve or die, in the gutter to lie,
W:And ne'er enter their dwellings no more.

W:(Chorus)
W:I'm a man that's done wrong to my parents,
W:And daily I wander about,
W:To earn a small mite for my lodging at night,
W:God help me, for now I'm cast out!
W:
W:Then my father will say when he meets me
W:"You beggar, you still are at large,
W:And mind, Sir, that you don't come near me,
W:Or by heaven I will give you in charge."
W:My mother, poor thing, 's broken-hearted,
W:To meet me she ofttimes will try,
W:For to give me a crown with her head hanging down
W:And a tear rolling out of her eye.
W:
W:I'd a sister that married a squire,
W:She'll ne'er look, nor speak unto me;
W:Because in this world she's much higher
W:And rides in her carriage so free.
W:Then the girl that I once loved so dearly,
W:Is dying broken-hearted, they say,
W:And there on her bed she is lying, near dead,
W:And now for her outcase doth pray.
W:
W:Kind friends, now from me take a warning,
W:From what I have just said to you;
W:And I hope in my dress you won't scorn me,
W:For you don't know what you may come to;
W:And I try to be honest and upright,
W:And do all the good that I can,
W:And I try all I know to get on in this world
W:And prove to my friends I'm a man.
