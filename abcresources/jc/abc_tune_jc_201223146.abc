%% Aaron is fiddler Vince's
%% son, and he is a whiz-bang bass player, let me
%% tell you. He was really rockin' at this year's
%% NEFFA Festival. We all had such a good time playing
%% together Saturday night with Tod Whittemore calling.
%% Like they say in Milwaukee,
%% "it doesn't get any better than this!"
