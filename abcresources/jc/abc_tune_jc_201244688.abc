W:I took that fair maid for a walk,
W:Mark well what I do say,
W:I took that fair maid for a walk,
W:And we had such a loving talk.

W:I put my arm around her waist,
W:Mark well what I do say,
W:I put my arm around her waist,
W:So slim and trim and tightly laced,
W:I'll go no more a-roving, with you fair maid.
W:A-roving, a-roving, since roving's been my ruin,
W:I'll go no more a-roving with you, fair maid.
