W:Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling
W:The darling of our crew;
W:No more he'll hear the tempest howling
W:For death has broach'd him to.
W:His form was of the manliest beauty,
W:His heart was kind and soft,
W:Faithful, below he did his duty,
W:But now he's gone aloft.
W:But now he's gone aloft.
W:
W:Tom never from his word departed,
W:His virtues were so rare,
W:His friends were many, and true-hearted,
W:His Poll was kind and fair;
W:And then he'd sing so blithe and jolly,
W:Ah!, many's the time and oft!
W:But mirth is turn'd to melancholy,
W:For Tom is gone aloft.
W:For Tom is gone aloft.
W:
W:Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather,
W:When He, who all commands,
W:Shall give, to call life's crew together,
W:The word to pipe all hands.
W:Thus Death, who kings and tars despatches,
W:In vain Tom's life has doff'd,
W:For, though his body's under hatches
W:His soul has gone aloft.
W:His soul has gone aloft.
