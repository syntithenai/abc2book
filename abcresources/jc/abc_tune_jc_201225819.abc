%% I'm sure Bill Paine has an official title
%% at Augusta, probably "program coordinator". In any case, he is one super wheel-greaser,
%% problem-solver, makes things happen-er, clerk-of-the-works, and general all-around
%% factotum. He is also an accommodating impromptu dancer, waltzing
%% with nice people on demand, and last summer he turned his talents towards
%% becoming a fine artillerist. He's been a good friend to me for years, and I am
%% so glad this tune has your name on it, Bill - Thanks a lot for all you do for all of us --
