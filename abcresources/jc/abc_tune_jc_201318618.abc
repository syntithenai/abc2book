W:Down in the meadows the other day,
W:Gathering flowers both fine and gay,
W:Gathering flowers both red and blue,
W:I little thought what love can do.
W:
W:I put my hand into the bush
W:Thinking the sweetest flower to find
W:I pricked my finger right to the bone
W:But left that sweetest flower behind.
W:
W:I leant my back against some oak
W:Thinking it was a trusty tree
W:First he bended then he broke
W:And so did my false love to me.
W:
W:There is a ship sailing on the sea
W:But it's loaded so deep as deep can be
W:But not so deep as the in love I am
W:I care not whether I sink or swim.
W:
W:Since my love's dead and gone to rest
W:I'll think on her who I love the best
W:I've secured her up in flannel strong
W:Have another now she is dead and gone.
