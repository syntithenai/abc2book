%% When Sarah Bauhan and I were on
%% the Isle of Mull in Sept '89, Cap't. Iain Morrison took us out
%% to see Fingal's Cave on his boat, Puffin II. It was a great
%% trip in a truly beautiful part of the world. We later played tunes
%% with Iain and others in great sessions at various. Iain
%% really liked to play "La Bastringue" on his accordion!
