%% Down Philly way there's a nice family named Mr & Mrs Bruce Nagy. Now it turns out that Mrs.
%% Nagy is Chris Brennan Nagy and that, you see, makes her A) John Brennan's
%% cousin and B) a fiddle player. Well, the Nagy's have a real cute daughter
%% named Tegan Nagy, (who is John Brennan's 2nd cousin) and _she's_ the
%% one this tune is for. Now isn't that nice? Say "Yes": "YES!" Thank you.
