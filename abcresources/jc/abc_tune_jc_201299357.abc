N: The dance is in 4 sections, with two columns; ## used to mark the 2nd column.
N: A B-sharp in the last bar supports the idea that this was in D minor, with one flat, though the key signature is empty.
N: Should the last c have a sharp?  And both parts should obviously be repeated (each strain twice for its column).
