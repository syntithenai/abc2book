%% This little tune is for my
%% youngest grandchild, Allison Parsons. Her folks are Becky (my
%% daughter) and Daniel, and she lives in Kissimmee, FL, so
%% I don't get to see her too often. But she's a sweetheart just
%% the same, and this tune comes to you with much love
%%               always, Allison, from Grampy
