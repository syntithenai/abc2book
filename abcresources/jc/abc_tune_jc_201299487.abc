W:I'll tell you of a brisk young sailor,
W:And Jimmy his name shall be,
W:He came across the wide ocean,
W:And then he came courting of me.

W:He followed me up, he followed me down,
W:He followed me to my father's room;
W:I'd not any tongue to say O Nay,
W:Nor no wings to fly away.

W:I want part of your father's money,
W:I want your mother's key,
W:And two of the best horses out of thirty and three.

W:He set me up on the milk-white steed,
W:And himself on the iron grey;

W:And pull the leaves upon the trees.
W:Six fair maids I have drowned here
W:And the seventh you shall be.
W:
W:Turn your back, she said to him,
W:Pull the leaves of the trees.
W:She got him round the middle small
W:And tripped him into the sea.
W:
W:Lie there, lie there, you dirty dog,
W:Lie there in place of me,
W:For six fair maids you've drowned here,
W:But the seventh you shall be.
W:
W:She got up on the milk-white steed,
W:By her side was the iron-grey;
W:She rode till she came to her father's gate
W:Three long hours before it was day.
