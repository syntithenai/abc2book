W:In a shady nook one moonlight night,
W:A leprehaun I spied;
W:With scarlet cap and coat of green,
W:A cruiskeen by his side.
W:'Twas tick tack tick his hammer went,
W:Upon a weeny shoe;
W:And I laughed to think of a purse of gold
W:But the fairy was laughing too!
W:
W:With tip-toe and beating heart,
W:Quite softly I drew nigh;
W:There was mischief in his merry face,
W:A twinkle in his eye.
W:He hammer'd and sang with tiny voice,
W:And drank his mountain dew
W:And I laughed to think he was caught at last;
W:But the fairy was laughing too.
W:
W:As quick as thought I seized the elf;
W:"Your fairy purse," I cried.
W:"The purse", he said, "'tis in her hand
W:That lady at your side."
W:I turned to look: the elf was off!
W:Then what was I to do?
W:O, I laughed to think what a fool I'd been;
W:And the fairy was laughing too!
