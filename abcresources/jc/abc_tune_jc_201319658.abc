%
% a descriptive piece wherein an old man gives voice
% to his woes, punctuated by the wailing of a peevish child
% and its calls for its Ma-ma. Skillful fiddlers and pipers would
% imitate those cries.The fiddle was lowered in pitch and the
% fiddler would lightly touch the bridge with a large door key
% held in his teeth to simulate the tones of human expression.
