W:Early one morning, just as the sun was rising,
W:I heard a maid sing in the valley below.
W:  Oh! don't de-ceive me, oh! never leave me,
W:  How could you use a poor maid-en so?

W:Remember the vows that you made to your Mary,
W:Remember the bow'r where you vowed to be true.

W:  Oh! don't deceive me...

W:Oh, gay is the garland, and fresh are the roses,
W:I've culled from the garden to bind on thy brow.
W:
W:  Oh! don't deceive me...

W:  Oh! don't deceive me...
