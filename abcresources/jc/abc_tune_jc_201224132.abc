%% If you were
%% to look in Book V you would find Harry's Jig, for Harry
%% Nelson of Francestown. Well, this one is for Jared Nelson,
%% Harry's son, and one of my great school-boy friends.
%% Jared's also a great skier, and perhaps some day we'll all
%% see him doing real good stuff on the tube -- World Cup, Olympics,
%% whatever. Who knows? Good Luck, Jared!
