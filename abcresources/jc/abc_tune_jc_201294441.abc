w:sure pret ty bird you with me will stay.
W:I sat on a bank in trifle and play,
W:With my jolly goss-hawk, and her wings were grey;
W:She flew to my breast, And there built her nest,
W:I am sure pretty bird you with me will stay.
W:
W:She builded within, and she builded without,
W:My jolly goss -hawk and her wings were grey:
W:She fluttered her wings, And she jingled her rings,
W:So merry was she, and so fond of play.
W:
W:I got me a bell, to tie to her foot,
W:My jolly goss-hawk, and her wings were grey;
W:She mounted in flight, And she flew out of sight,
W:My bell and my rings she carried away.
W:
W:I ran up the street, with nimblest feet,
W:My jolly goss-hawk, and her wings were grey;
W:I whooped and hallo'd, But never she shewed,
W:And I lost my pretty goss-hawk that day.
W:
W:In a meadow so green, the hedges between,
W:My jolly goss-hawk, and her wings were grey;
W:Upon a man's hand, She perch'd did stand,
W:In sport, and trifle, and full array.
W:
W:
W:Who's got her may keep her as best he can,
W:My jolly goss-hawk, and her wings were grey;
W:To every man she is frolic and free,
W:I'll cast her off if she come my way.
