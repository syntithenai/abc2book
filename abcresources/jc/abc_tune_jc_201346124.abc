w: And those streams are fast fast_ bound_ by the_ frost
W:The trees they're all bare, not one green leaf to be seen,
W:And those meadows their beauty hath lost;
W:As for the leaves, they are fallen from the trees
W:And those streams are fast,
W:And those streams are fast, fast bound by the frost.

W:The poor little small birds to the barn doors fly for food,
W:Silent the restle on the spray;
W:The innocent hares search the woods for all their food,
W:Lest their footsteps should,
W:Lest their footsteps should their innocence betray.
W:
W:The poor little pigeons sit shivering on the barn,
W:Coldly the north winds do blow;
W:The innocent sheep run the downs unto their fold,
W:With their fleeces all
W:With their fleeces all quite cover-ed with snow.
W:
W:The poor little oxen in the yard all fother'd on straw
W:Sends forth their breath like the steam;
W:The sweet-looking milkmaid she finds that she must go
W:Flakes of ice finds she
W:Flakes of ice finds she, she finds all on her cream.
W:
W:Now Christmas is come and our song we have sung,
W:Soon will come the Springtime of the year;
W:Come hand to me the glass and I'll drink your health all round,
W:For I wish you all
W:For I wish you all a bright and happy New Year.
