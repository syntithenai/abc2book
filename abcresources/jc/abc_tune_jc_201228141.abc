%% Sheila Moran is a
%% real nice woman who, living up in Lebanon as
%% she does, has more than a passing acquaintance with
%% David Millstone (like, you know, they're married!)
%% Well, of course, this puts her right in line for a
%% tune of her own (I know - it's about time!) and so
%% anyway, here it is, Sheila, with love from MAC,
%% and I sure hope you like dancing to it!
