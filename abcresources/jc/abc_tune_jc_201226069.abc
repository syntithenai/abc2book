%% As you've gone through this book,
%% you've already read my rants about the Fiddle Puppets dance group. And I
%% expect that my words don't mean much to someone who hasn't seen them perform.
%% But I can tell you that Rodney Sutton has to be one of the best cloggers I ever saw --
%% you've just got to see him all wound up and running to know what I'm
%% talking about. He's not the youngest in the group, but he sure as
%% hell is spectacular, and I just love watching him and the rest of
%% them when I'm down in West Virginia enjoying my yearly visit at
%% Augusta. Thanks loads, Rodney, and thanks again to you all - see you
%% next year!
