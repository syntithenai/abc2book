W:My dearie sits ower late up,
W:My hinney sits ower late up,
W:My laddy sits ower late up,
W:Betwixt the pint pot and the cup.
W:
W:Hey! Johnnie, come hame to your bairn,
W:Hey! Johnnie, come hame to your bairn,
W:Hey! Johnnie, come hame to your bairn,
W:Wiv a rye loaf under your airm.
W:
W:He addles three ha'pence a week,
W:Tha's nobbut a farding a day,
W:He sits wiv his pipe in his cheek,
W:And he fuddles his money away.
W:
W:My laddy is never the near,
W:My hinney is never the near,
W:And when I cry out "lad cam hame,"
W:He calls out again for mair beer.
