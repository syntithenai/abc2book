%% Philip McBride is
%% a real nice boy and he's George and Lee's oldest child.
%% He's also full of music, just like his sisters, and
%% guess what? He's a guitar player! And I bet you
%% dollars to donuts he can back up this tune on his
%% guitar if he can only get _somebody_ to play it for him!
%% Good luck, Phil!
