%% This tune's been waiting in the
%% wings for TEN YEARS! Do you believe that? I first wrote it in
%% March 1983, and it's for Diana Jacobs, who lives over in Chesham;
%% She was living in Dublin when I decided she needed a tune - She's
%% a great dancer, ou know; but the melody needed work, and so,
%% at long last, here it is. Probably no better than it ever was,
%% Diana, but I hope you like it!
