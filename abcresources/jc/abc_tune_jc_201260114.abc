w:There has-n't been such a he-*ro, boys,_ found out this hund-red year.
W:Come all you jolly seamen that loves to hear the drum,
W:I will tell you of a robber that on the seas did roam;
W:Some say his name is Captain Ward and it plainly does appear,
W:There hasn't been such a hero, boys, found out this hundred year.
W:
W:Our king he built a gallant ship, a ship of noble fame,
W:She is called the saucy "Rainbow" if you must know her name,
W:Our ship she is well-rigged and fitted out for sea,
W:With eleven hundred seamen to keep her company.
W:
W:We sailed round and round, my boys, where this great robber lay,
W:"Where is the master of your ship?" the gallant "Rainbow" cried,
W:"Lo, here am I," says Captain Ward, "my name I'll never deny,
W:And if you are one of the King's ships you're welcome to pass by."
W:
W:"If you've any resolution your skill all for to try
W:You and I will have a battle before we do pass by."
W:"With all my heart," says Captain Ward, "I value you not a pin,
W:Although you show your brass without, I am good steel within."
W:
W:So at eight o'clock in the morning the battle did begin,
W:And so it did continue till eight o'clock again.
W:"Fight on, fight on," says Captain Ward, "your sport well pleases me,
W:And if you fight for a month or more, your master I will be.
W:
W:I never robbed an English ship nor ship of noble fame,
W:Nor yet the blackguard Dutchman that sails all on the main;
W:Go home, go home and tell your King, And tell him this from me,
W:That if he reigns King over all the land, it's I'll reign King at sea."
