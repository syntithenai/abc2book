W:And so happy are we when the summer draws near,
W:Then so happy are we when the summer draws near.
W:
W:When Phoebus draws near on the side of the lime,
W:When out upon us the the summer does shine,
W:When the little birds all around us they do warble their breast,
W:And the cuckoo she doth join her notes with the rest,
W:And the cuckoo she sing her notes with the rest.
