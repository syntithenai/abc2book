W:Our captain's name was Sir William Gower
W:And his crew amounted to just four score,
W:All seamen brave to cross the sea
W:Bound for New York in Amerikee.
W:
W:Our captain in his cabin lay
W:When a dreadful voice to him did say:
W:Prepare thyself and thy ship's company
W:For tomorrow night in the deep might lay.
W:
W:Our captain woke in a dreadful fright
W:Being in the third watch of the night
W:And to the bosun aloud did call
W:Between the secret enclosed them all.
W:
W:Saying, Bosun, Bosun, let no one know
W:What we poor sailors do undergo,
W:But keep the secret but in thy breast
W:And pray to God to give you rest.
W:
W:I killed my merchant a neighbour there,
W:'Twas all for the sake of his lady fair,
W:I killed my wife and children three
W:'Twas all for the sake of jealousy.
W:
W:The gay young sailor he beared the blame,
W:He was hung and quatered for the same.
W:It is his ghost, I am afraid,
W:This very night my heart betrayed.
W:
W:The sea run over us both fore and aft
W:Till a very few men a-deck was left,
W:And then our boatsman did declare
W:Our captain was a murderer.
W:
W:The sea enraged all our ship's crew
W:And overboard our captain threw;
W:And the wind did cease and calm the sea
W:And we sailed safe to Amerikee.
