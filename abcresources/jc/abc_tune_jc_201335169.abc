W:As I roved out by the sea side,
W:(Ev'ry rose grows merry in time),
W:I met a little girl,
W:And I gave her my hand,
W:And I says, "Will you be a true lover of mine?
W:
W:If you are to be a true lover of mine
W:(Ev'ery rose grows merry in time),
W:You must make me a shirt without needle or seam,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:You must wash it in a spring well,
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:Where the water never ran or the rain never fell,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:You must dry it in a hawthorn tree,
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:That never was blossomed since Adam was born,
W:And then you will be a true lover of mine."
W:
W:"Now, Sir, you have questioned me three times three,
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:But I might question as many as thee,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:You must get me a farm of the best land
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:Between the salt water and the sea strand,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:You must plough it with a goat's horn,
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:And sow it all over with one grain of corn,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:You must thrash it in a sparrow's nest,
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:And shake it all out with a cobbler's awl,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine.
W:
W:And when you are done, and finished your work
W:(Every rose grows merry in time),
W:You can come back to me, and I'll give you your shirt,
W:And it's then you will be a true lover of mine!"
