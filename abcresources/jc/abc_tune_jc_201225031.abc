%% We all mourn the recent loss of our
%% friend, Dave Fuller. He was a greatly-valued member of Dudley
%% Laufman's Canterbury Country Dance Orchestra, and it was his
%% wonderful accordion playing that contributed so much to that
%% special Canterbury sound. This tune is for Dave and Edith's
%% lovely daughter, Jennifer, with much love, from Bob.
