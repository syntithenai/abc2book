%% I started teaching in
%% what later became the Contoocook Valley Regional School District
%% ("Conval" for short) in 1959; although I retired in 1984, I am still
%% connected with the high school (Conval High School) where I
%% substitute teach on request and coach weight lifting. I've
%% had the title to this tune for several years, but the tune itself
%% came only a short while ago. I'm real glad it did.
