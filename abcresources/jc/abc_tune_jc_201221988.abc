%% In 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation appointing the last Thursday of November as a day of
%% thanks-giving and prayer. Up to this time the custom had been strictly confined to the will of the
%% governors of the respective states, with the exception of Washington's administration. Since 1863,
%% every president of the United States has appointed the last Thursday of November as a National day
%% of Thanksgiving, and nearly all governors of the states have followed with proclamations for their
%% respective states.
