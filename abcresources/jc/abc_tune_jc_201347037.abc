W:Hark where the night is falling.
W:Hark hear the pipes a calling
W:Loudly and proudly calling down thru the glen.
W:There where the hills are sleeping,
W:Now feel the blood a leaping,
W:High as the spirits of the old highland men.

W:Chorus:
W:Towering in gallant fame,
W:Scotland my mountain hame,
W:High may your proud standards gloriously wave.
W:Land of my high endeavor,
W:Land of the shining river,
W:Land of my heart forever, Scotland the Brave.
W:
W:High in the misty mountains,
W:Out by the purple highlands,
W:Brave are the hearts that beat beneath Scottish skies.
W:Wild are the winds to meet you.
W:Staunch are the friends that greet you.
W:Kind as the love that shines from fair maidens eyes.
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:Faroff in sunlit places,
W:Sad are the Scottish faces,
W:Yearnin' to feel the kiss of sweet Scottish rain.
W:Where tropic skies are beaming,
W:Love sets the heart a'dreaming,
W:Longing and dreaming for the homeland again!
W:(Chorus)
