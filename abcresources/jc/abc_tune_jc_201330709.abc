W:1. I've seen lots o' bonnie lassies on my travels wide,
W: but my heart is centred noo on bonnie Kate McBride.
W: Al-tho I'm no' a fellow that would throw a word away,
W: I'm surprised sometimes mysel' at a' I've got to say,
W:
W:Chorus:
W:    Roamin' in the gloamin' on the bonnie banks o' Clyde,
W:    roamin' in the gloamin' wae my lassie by my side.
W:    When the sun has gone to rest, that's the time that we love best,
W:    o, it's lovely roamin' in the gloamin'!
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:2. One nicht in the gloamin' we were trippin' side by side,
W: I kissed her twice, and I asked her once if she would be my bride.
W: She was shy and so was I, we were both the same,
W: but I got brave and braver on the journey comin' hame.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:3. Last nicht efter strollin' we got in at half past nine,
W: and sitting at the kitchen fire I asked her to be mine.
W: When she promised, I got up and I danced the Hie-lan' fling,
W: I've just been to the jew'ller's and I bought her a bonnie wee ring.
