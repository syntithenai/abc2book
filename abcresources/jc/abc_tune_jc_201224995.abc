%% Every so often, over the years,
%% some of my favorite school kids will make it into one of these tune books,
%% and that's what happened this time! This one's for Derek Buffum, now
%% of Hillsboro, NH, but raised in Antrim. He's got a real nice girlfriend
%% named Melissa, and would believe his dog's name is Jordache?
%% Well, it is! Well anyway, here's a tune for you, little Buff, with love from 
%% MAC.
