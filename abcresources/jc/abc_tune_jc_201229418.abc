%%begintext align
%% "The Spanish Cavalier" and "Solomon Levi" may be sung simultaneously by two groups of
%% singers. The groups should be of equal strength and each group rehearsed on its song
%% until it can sing it well. Then, under some capable leader who will mark the rhythm with
%% strongly accented beat, let the two groups sing the numbers together. There should be no
%% attempt at piano accompaniment. Singers of all ages will enjoy the "stunt".
