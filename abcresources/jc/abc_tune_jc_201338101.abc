w:Speed bon-nie boat, like a bird on the wing, "On-ward," the sail-ors cry!
w:Car-ry the lad_ that's born to be king, o-ver the sea to Skye!

w:Loud the winds howl, load the waves roar, Thund-er-claps rend the air;

w:Baf-fled our foes stand on the shore, Fol-low they will not dare.

W:Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
W:"Onward," the sailors cry!
W:Carry the lad that's born to be king,
W:over the sea to Skye!
W:  Loud the winds howl, load the waves roar,
W:  Thunderclaps rend the air;
W:  Baffled our foes stand on the shore,
W:  Follow they will not dare.
W:
W:Bold the waves leap, soft shall ye sleeep,
W:Ocean's a royal bed,
W:Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
W:Watch by your weary head.
W:
W:Many's the lad, fought on that day
W:Well the claymore could wield
W:When the night came, silently lay
W:Dead on Culloden's field.
W:
W:Burned are our homes, exiled and dead
W:Scattered the loyal men,
W:Yet ere the sword cool in the sheat
W:Charlie will come again
