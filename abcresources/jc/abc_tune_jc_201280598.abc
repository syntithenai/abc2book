W:There came an Earl a riding by,
W:A gipsy maid espyed he;
W:O nut-brown maid, from green wood glade,
W:O prithee come along with me."
W:"I am so blythe, as bird so gay.
W:In thy castle tall, in bower and hall,
W:I fear for grief I'd pine away."
W:
W:"Thou shalt no more be set in stocks,
W:And tramp about from town to town,
W:But thou shalt ride in pomp and pride
W:In velvet red and broidered gown."
W:"My brothers three no more I'd see,
W:If that I went with thee, I trow.
W:They sing me to sleep, with songs so sweet,
W:They sing as on our way we go."
W:
W:"Thou shalt not be torn by thistle and thorn,
W:With thy bare feet all in the dew.
W:But shoes shall wear of Spanish leather
W:And silken stockings all of blue."
W:"I will not go to thy castle high,
W:For thou wilt weary soon, I know,
W:Of the gipsy maid, from the green-wood glade,
W:And drive her forth in rain and snow."
W:
W:"Al night you lie neath the starry sky
W:In rain and snow you trudge all day,
W:But thy brown head, in a feather bed,
W:When left the gipsies, thou shalt lay."
W:"I love to lie 'neath the starry sky,
W:I do not heed the snow and rain,
W:But fickle as wind, I fear to find
W:The man who now my heart would gain."
W:
W:"I will thee wed, sweet maid," he said,
W:"I will wed with a golden ring,
W:Thy days shall be spent in merriment;
W:For us the marriage bells shall swing."
W:The dog did howl, and screeched the owl,
W:The raven croaked, the night-wind sighed;
W:The wedding bell from the steeple fell,
W:As home the Earl did bear his bride.
