%% Did you ever hug a bear?
%% Or get hugged _by_ a bear? Well, I came close when I played
%% for the Bear Hug '08 Dance Camp in Rollins, MT. It was their
%% 25th anniversary, and Helen Pilling and Dan'l Moore of Kila,
%% MT, got us "Rhthym Rollers" out there along with "KGB", to
%% play for them. It was a great time. Good Food!! (For the best in
%% instrument cases, look up Coon Hollow Canvas, Kila, MT.!)
