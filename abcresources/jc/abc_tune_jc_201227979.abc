%% There is no way that this
%% tune will provide adequate compensation to David
%% Millstone for all the happiness he has brought into my
%% life, but I guess it could be called a step in the right direction.
%% Anyhow, it's your tune, David, and it comes to you with sincere
%% thanks and best wishes always from your friend, Mac.
