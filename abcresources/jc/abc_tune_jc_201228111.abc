%% Over in the town of Nelson, not
%% quite a half hour from here, there's a Contra Dance every
%% Monday night that's been running in the region for the
%% last two hundred-or-so years. It's a sit-in situation
%% for musicians (leads take turns), and callers are welcome
%% to do the same. Rich is one of the regulars who comes and
%% calls, and he's one of the spark plugs of the dance. We're
%% always glad to see you, Rich!
