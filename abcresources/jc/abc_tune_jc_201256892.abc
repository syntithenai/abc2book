W:In Bristol Town, as I have heard tell,
W: A rich merchant there did dwell.
W:He had a daughter beautiful and bright,
W:On her he fixed his own hearts delight
W:
W:Courted she was by many in the town,
W:Courted she was by many a clever man,
W:Courted she was by many a clever man,
W:But none could this young lady's heart gain.
W:
W: Till a brisk young sailor he came from the seas,
W:He did the lady well please.
W:He was a brisk young man although a sailor poor,
W:And the lady did the sailor adore
W:
W:And when her father came for to be told
W:She was courted by this jolly sailor bold,
W:"No! never, never, oh! while I do live,
W:Not any portion unto you I'll give!"
W:
W:"As for your portion I do not care,
W:I'll wed the man whom I love so dear,
W:I'll wed the man that I do love so,
W:If along with him a-begging I go!"
W:
W:Her father kept a valiant servant man,
W:Who wrote a letter out of hand;
W:This letter was the sailor to invite
W:To meet her in the valley by night.
W:
W:Her father kept a valiant Irishman,
W:And fifty pounds he gave him out of hand,
W:And a brace of pocket pistols likewise,
W:He mounted, and away he did ride.
W:
W:He mounted and away he did ride,
W:Till at length the jolly sailor he espied,
W:At length the jolly sailor he spied there,
W:A-waiting for his joy and his dear.
W:
W: He said "I am come to kill you indeed,
W:Away! back to some tavern with speed;
W:Cheer up your heart with bowls of good wine,
W:And soon I'll make you know my design
W:
W:"I will go back to my master with speed,
W:Saying "Master, I have killed that man, indeed!
W:I have buried him all in his grave so low,
W:Where streams and fountains over him, do flow."
W:
W:In course of time the rich merchant died,
W:Which filled the lady's heart full with pride;
W:Now she's married to that man, you know, so brave,
W:Who her father thought was dead, and in his grave.
