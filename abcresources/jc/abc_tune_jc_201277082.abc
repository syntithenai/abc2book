W:Most of the 16ths & dotted 8ths on the second beats were more like triplets - i.e. 1/3 + 2/3.
W:So the rhythm was softer than what's written here by a little bit.  But most of the
W:rhythms were very angular.
W:
W:She referred to all of the (1/8 + 1/16 + 1/16) beats as "triplets."   But her transcriptions
W:from Mendocino summer '04 show these rhythms as above, which is close to how she plays
W:these.

W:All the uneven triplets in this tune were played somewhere between triplets (1/3 +2/3)
W:    & (1/16 + 1/8(dotted) ) in rhythm.
W: * The triplets in these measures were between a true triplet &( 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/8).
W: It was not as "angular" a rhythm as in the other tunes.
W:
W: m = inverted mordant - i.e. a one-finger-flick downward "drill".
