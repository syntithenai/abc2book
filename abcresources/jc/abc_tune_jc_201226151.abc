%% Jan Caulfield and Tom Paul
%% live in Juneau, AK, and I had the pleasure of meeting them last
%% spring when I was lucky enough to be up there. Tom called a great
%% dance, and Rex Blazer was the fiddler, and you-know-who played
%% piano, and it was a real fun time. They're really enthusiastic about
%% contra dancing in Juneau - lots of people dance and lots of musicians
%% are playing for them - it's a wonderful scene - Thanks for
%% getting me up there and being so nice to me - I had a wonderful time --
