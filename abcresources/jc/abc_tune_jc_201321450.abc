S:Patrick O'Keeffe MS in accordion notation
B:Dan Herlihey, Sliabh Luachra Music Masters,
B:Volume 1, page 48.
N:In the MS as a no name slide. The first part
N:is almost identical to 'The Flight', as found
N:in James Aird, 1782, Volume II.
N:Perhaps 'The Farranfore Slide' might be an
N:appropriate title for it, because that is
N:where Kerry Airport now lives.
N:The turn had one of those 'repeat the bar
N:marked A and then the bar B', which does not
N:always work unless you alter some of the
N:notes to fit, which is what I have done.
Z:ATB
