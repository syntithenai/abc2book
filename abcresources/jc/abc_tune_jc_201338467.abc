%% "I was coming out of Eshaness in late January, 1969, the time was after 11 pm and as I
%% looked back at the top of the hill leading out of the district I saw so few lights compared
%% to what I remembered when I was young. As I watched, the lights started going out one
%% by one. That, coupled with the recent death of my late wife, made me think of the old
%% word 'Slockit', meaning, a light that has gone out, and I think that was what inspired
%% the tune." From a tape recorded interview with Tom by a student in 1970. The second
%% fiddle part was written by an American student in 1979.
