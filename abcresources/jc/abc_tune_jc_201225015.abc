%% Bob and Lydia Reeve come to
%% the dances all the time (Lydia is a fine fiddler, too), and
%% I think they are pretty lucky people because they have a
%% real nice little daughter named Fritha. So this is
%% your tune, Fritha, and I sure hope you like it - if you
%% smile at me at the next dance, perhaps that'll mean
%% that you do!
