w:six by three; Oh_ bu-ry me not on the lone prair-ie
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free.
W:In a narrow grave just six by three;
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:It matters not I've oft been told,
W:Where the body lies when the heart grows cold.
W:Yet grant, oh grant, this wish to me
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:I've always wished to be laid when I died
W:In the little churchyard on the green hillside;
W:By my father's grave there let mine be,
W:And bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:Let my death-slumber be where my mother's prayer
W:And a sister's tear will mingle there;
W:Where my friends can come and weep o'er me;
W:O bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:"O bury me not" and his voice failed there.
W:But we took no heed of his dying prayer.
W:In a narrow grave just six by three
W:We buried him there on the lone prairie.
W:
W:And the cowboys now as they roam the plain
W:For they marked the spot where his bones were lain
W:Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave
W:With a prayer to Him who his soul will save.
W:
W:"O bury me not on the lone prairie,
W:Where the wolves can howl and growl o'er me.
W:Fling a handful of roses o'er my grave
W:With a prayer to Him who my soul will save."
