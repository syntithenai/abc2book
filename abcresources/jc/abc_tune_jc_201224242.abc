%% Every so often Skip
%% Gorman gets pursuaded to leave the wilds of Grafton NH
%% and come down this way long enough to play his fiddle
%% at one of our dances. That's real nice when it happens,
%% and even nicer (for me, anyway) is when I'm playing piano
%% along with him! Hope you'll come again soon, Skip!
