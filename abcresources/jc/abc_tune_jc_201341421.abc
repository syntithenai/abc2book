W: Oh, the streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts,
W: Where the young men and maidens they do meet their sweet hearts.
W: It is drinking of good liquor caused my heart for to sing,
W: And the noise in yonder village made the rocks for to ring.
W:
W: At the top of this mountain, there my love's castle stands.
W: It's all overbuilt with ivory on yonder black sand,
W: Fine arches, fine porches, and diamonds so bright.
W: It's a pilot for a sailor on a dark winter's night.
W:
W: On yonder high mountain, where the wild fowl do fly,
W: There is one amongst them that flies very high.
W: If I had her in my arms, love, near the diamond's black land,
W: How soon I'd secure her by the sleight of my hand.
W:
W: At the bottom of this mountain there runs a river clear.
W: A ship from the Indies did once anchor there,
W: With her red flags a-flying and the beating of her drum,
W: Sweet instruments of music and the firing of her gun.
W:
W: So come all you little streamers that walk the meadows gay,
W: I'll write unto my own true love, wherever she may be.
W: For her rosy lips entice me, with her tongue she tells me `No',
W: And an angel might direct us right, and where shall we go?
