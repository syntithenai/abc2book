%% Tom Daly is the owner of the
%% Fishtraks Recording Studio over in Portsmouth. That's where
%% Sarah Bauhan made her albums, and Rick Watson was the
%% engineer. He and Sarah also remixed New England Tradition's
%% "Farewell to the Hollow," and I am just so pleased with what he
%% did that I thought he had a right to this hornpipe. Perhaps
%% you'll play it on your synthesizer, Rick!
