W:1.~When sorrows encompass me round
W:And many distresses I see
W:When astonished I cry can a mortal be found
W:Surrounded with trouble like me
W:
W:2.~Few seasons of peace I enjoy
W:And they are succeeded by pain
W:If e’er a few moments of praise I employ
W:I’ll have hours and days to complain
W:
W:3.~No sorrows be vented that day
W:When Jesus will call me home
W:With singing and shouting let each brother say
W:He’s gone from the evil to come
W:
W:4.~O when will my sorrows subside
W:O when will my sufferings cease
W:O when to the bosom of Christ be conveyed
W:In mansions of glory and bliss
W:
W:5.~May I be prepared for that day
W:When Jesus shall bid me remove
W:That I may in rapture go shouting away
W:To the arms of my heavenly love
W:
W:6.~My spirit to glory conveyed
W:My body laid low in the ground
W:Though I wish not a tear ‘round my grave to be shed
W:But all join in praising around
W:
W:7.~Immersed in an ocean of love
W:My soul like and angel shall sing
W:Till Christ shall descend with a shout from above
W:And make all creation to ring_
