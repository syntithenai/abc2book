%% April named this
%% tune; I wrote it for her. "I've been waiting for you to
%% write me a minor key waltz," she said at the time.
%% She really liked it (you should have heard her play it!),
%% and she named it after a place owned by one of her
%% aunts, when she had enjoyed happy times as a girl.
