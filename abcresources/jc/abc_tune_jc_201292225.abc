w:wife! Iss, I will!
W:Come hither, son Jan! since thou art a man,
W:I'll gi'e the best counsel in life,
W:Come, sit down by me, and my story shall be,
W:I'll tell how to get thee a wife.
W:Iss, I will! man, I will!
W:Zure I will!
W:I'll tell how to get thee a wife! Iss, I will!
W:
W:Thy self thou must dress in thy Sunday-go-best;
W:They'll first turn away and be shy.
W:But boldly, kiss each purty maid that thou see'st,
W:They'll call thee their Love, by-and-bye.
W:Iss, they will! man, they will!
W:Zure they will!
W:They'll call thee their love by-and-bye! Iss, they will!
W:
W:So a courting Jan goes in his holiday clothes,
W:All trim, nothing ragged and torn,
W:From his hat to his hose; with a sweet yellow rose,
W:He looked like a gentleman born.
W:Iss, he did! man he did!
W:Zure he did!
W:He looked like a gentleman born! Iss he did!
W:
W:The first pretty lass that Jan did see pass,
W:A farmer's fat daughter called Grace,
W:He'd scarce said 'How do?' and a kind word or two,
W:Her fetched him a slap in the face.
W:Iss, her did! man, her did!
W:Zure her did!
W:Her fetched him a slap in the face! Iss, her did!
W:
W:As Jan, never fearing o' nothing at all
W:Was walking adown by the locks.
W:He kiss'd the parson's wife, which stirred up a strife
W:And Jan was put into the stocks.
W:Iss, he was! man, he was!
W:Zure he was!
W:And Jan was put into the stocks! Iss, he was!
W:
W:'If this be the way, how to get me a wife,'
W:Quoth Jan, 'I will never have none
W:I'd rather live single the whole of my life
W:And home to my mammy I'll run.
W:Iss, I will! man, I will!
W:Zure I will!
W:And home to my mammy I'll run! Iss, I will!'
