w:name was love-ly Flo-*ra, the Li ly of the West.
W:'Twas when I came to England, some pleasures for to find,
W:There I espied a damsel most pleasing to my mind;
W:Her rosy cheeks and shining eyes as arrows pierced my breast,
W:Her name was lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.
W:
W:Her golden hair in ringlets hung, her dress was spangled o'er;
W:She'd rings on every finger, brought from a foreign shore;
W:'Twould ruin kings and princes, so richly was she dress'd,
W:She far excelleth Venus, this Lily of the West.
W:
W:I courted her a fortnight, in hopes her love to gain,
W:But soon she turn'd against me, which caused all my pain.
W:She robb'd me of my freedom, she robb'd me of my rest,
W:I roam, forsook of Flora, the Lily of the West.
W:
W:Alas! where'er I wander, however much I will,
W:The thought of that fair maiden abideth with me still;
W:For ever I am downcast, for ever sore oppress'd,
W:An outcast e'er from Flora, the Lily of the West.
