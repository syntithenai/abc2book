N: The last bar of V:2 shifted back to bass clef, but staying in treble is simpler to read.

N: This is an ABC1 transcription of the tune, but the apparent use of multiple voices is essentially meaningles,
N: and the tune is slightly easier to read in this version.  The only fragments that are really different are the
N: D in bar 2, which is an 8th note in the book, and the tied e' notes in the bass in bar 9, which are written as
N: an E4 half note on the V:1 E line but clearly should be played by the bass player. The rest of the apparent
N: multi-voice fragments are merely writing the bass "chords" with two stems (up & down) rather than one.
N: So I didn't bother making a separate ABC2 transcription of this tune.
N: Also, the last half-measure of the bass reverts to bass clef, but it's a bit clearer if left in treble clef
N: (and this has nothing to do with the voices).
