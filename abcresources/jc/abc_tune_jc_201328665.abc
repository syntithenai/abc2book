w:The farm-er says, "Well done, my lads,_ here's li-quor at your com-mand *
W:Come all you lads and lasses, together let us go
W:Into some pleasant cornfield our courage for to show;
W:With the reaphook and the sickle so well we clear the land,
W:The farmer says, "Well done, my lads, here's liquor at your command."

W:By daylight in the morning, when birds so sweetly sing,
W:- They are such charming creatures, they make the valleys ring -
W:We will reap and scrape together till Phoebus do go down
W:With the good old leathern bottle and the beer that is so brown.
W:
W:Then in come lovely Nancy, the corn all for to lay,
W:She is my charming creature, I must begin to pray;
W:See how she gathers it, binds it, she folds it in her arms,
W:Then gives it to some waggoner to fill a farmer's barns.
W:
W:Now harvest's done and ended, the corn secure from harm,
W:All for to go to market, boys, we must threash in the barn;
W:Here's a health to all you farmers, likewise to all you men,
W:I wish you health and happiness till harvest comes again.
