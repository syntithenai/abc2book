W: Avenging and bright fall the swift sword of Erin,
W: On him who the brave sons of Usna betray'd!
W For ev'ry fond eye he hath waken'd a tear in,
W: A drop from his heart-wounds shall weep o'er her blade!
W: By the red cloud that hung over Conner's dark dwelling,
W: When Ulad's three champions lay sleeping in gore
W: By the billows of war, which so often, high swelling,
W: Have wafted these heroes to victory's shore.
W: We swear to revenge them! no joy shall be tasted,
W: The harp shall be silent, the maiden unwed,
W: Our halls shall be mute and our fields shall lie wasted,
W: 'Till vengeance is wreak'd on the murderer's head!
W: Yes, monarch! tho' sweet are our home recollections,
W: 'Tho sweet are the tears that from tenderness fall;
W: Tho' sweet are our friendships, our hopes, our affections,
W: Revenge on a tyrant is sweetest of all!
