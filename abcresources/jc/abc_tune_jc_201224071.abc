%% This second tune 
%% is for my dear cousin Eddy Martinez. He and
%% Cathy really surprised me one time when they
%% came to a contra dance we were playing for at
%% Woods Hole, MA. I couldn't believe my eyes!
%% Ted Sanella was calling that night, with Sarah Bauhan,
%% David Surette, and I making the music. It was a great
%% evening in my life.
