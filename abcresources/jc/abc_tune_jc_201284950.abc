W:Here's a health unto our master, the founder of the feast.
W:We hope to God with all our hearts his soul in heav'n may rest;
W:That all his works may prosper, whatever he takes in hand,
W:For we are all his servants, and all at his command.
W:So drink, boys, drink,  And see that you do not spill
W:For if you do you shall drink two, for 'tis our master's will.

W:And now we've drunk our master's health, why should out missus go free?
W:For why shouldn't she go the heaven, to heaven as well as he?
W:She is a good purvider, abroad as well as at home,
W:So fill your cup and sup it up, for 'tis our havest home.
W:So drink, boys, drink,  And see that you do not spill
W:For if you do you shall drink two, for 'tis our master's will.
