w:May God keep all_ good peo-ple from such bad com-pa-ny!
W:A story I will tell to you, it is of butchers three:
W:Gibson, Wilson and Johnson, mark well what I do say;
W:Now as they had five hundred pounds, all on a market day, 
W:Now as they had five hundred pounds to pay upon their way.

W:Chorus: With my hey ding ding, With my ho, ding ding,       
W:With my high ding ding, hey dey 
W:May God keep all good people from such bad company!
W:
W:Now as they rode along the road as fast as they could hie,
W:"Spur on your horse," says Johnson, "for I hear a woman cry."
W:And, as they rode into the wood, the scene they spied around,
W:And there they found a woman lay a-swooning on the ground.
W:
W:Now Johnson, being a valiant man, he bore a valiant mind,
W:He wrapped her in his great coat, and placed her up behind.
W:And as they rode along the road, as fast as they could ride,
W:She put her fingers to her ear and gave a screekful cry.
W:
W:With that, came out ten swaggering baldes, with their rapiers in their hand,
W:They rode up to bold Johnson, and boldly bid him stand.
W:"Oh, I cannot fight," says Gibson, "I am sure that I shall die!"
W:"No more won't I", cried Wilson, "for I will sooner fly!"
W:
W:"Come on, come on!" cried Johnson, "there are but five for me,
W:And woman, stand you there behind; we'll gain the victory"
W:The very next pistol Johnson fired was loaded with powder and ball.
W:And out of these five swaggering blades there's three of them did fall.
W:
W:"Come on! Come on!" cries Johnson, "there are but two for me,
W:And, woman, stand you their behind; we'll gain the victory!"
W:As Johnson fought these rogues in front, the woman he did not mind,
W:She took the knife all from his side and ripped him down behind.
W:
W:"Now I must fall," says Johnson, "I must fall to the ground!
W:For relieving this wicked woman she gave me my death wound!
W:Oh woman, woman, woman, what have you been and done?
W:You have killed the finest butcher that ever the sun shone on!"
W:
W:Now, just as she had done the deed some men came riding by
W:And, seeing what this woman had done, the raised a dreadful cry.
W:Then she was condemned to die in links, and iron chains so strong,
W:For killing of bold Johnson, that great and valiant man.
