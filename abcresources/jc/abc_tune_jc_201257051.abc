W:One summer evening, a maiden fair
W:Was walking forth in the balmy air,
W:She met a sailor upon the way;
W:'Maiden stay' he whispered,
W:'Maiden stay' he whispered
W:'O pretty maiden stay!'
W:
W:'Why art thou walking abroad alone?
W:The stars are shining, the day is done,'
W:O then her tears they began to flow;
W:For a dark eyed sailor,
W:For a dark eyed sailor
W:Had filled her heart with woe.
W:
W:'Three years had pass'd since he left this land,
W:A ring of gold he took off my hand,
W:He broke the token, a half to keep,
W:Half he bade me treasure,
W:Half he bade me treasure,
W:Then crossed the briny deep.'
W:
W:'O drive him damsel from out your mind,
W:For men are changeful as is the wind,
W:And love inconstant will quickly grow
W:Cold as winter morning,
W:Cold as winter morning,
W:When lands are white with snow.'
W:
W:'Above the snow is holly seen,
W:In bitter blast it abideth green,
W:And blood-red drops it as berries bears
W:So my aching bosom,
W:So my aching bosom,
W:In truth and sorrow wears.'
W:
W:Then half the ring did the sailor show,
W:Away with weeping and sorrow now!
W:'In bands of marriage united we
W:Like the broken Token,
W:Like the broken token,
W:In one shall welded be.'
