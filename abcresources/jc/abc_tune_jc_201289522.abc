W:2. I love a lassie, a bonnie Hielan' lassie,
W:    She can warble like like a mavis in the dell.
W: She's an angel ev'ry Sunday, but a jolly lass on Monday,
W:    She's as modest as her namesake, the blue-bell.
W: She's nice and neat and tidy and I meet her ev'ry Friday,
W:    That's a very special nicht, I wouldn’t miss.
W: I'm enchanted, I'm enraptured, since my heart the darlin'captur'd,
W:    She's just intoxicated me with bliss.
W:--- CHORUS ---
W:3. I love a lassie, a bonnie Hielan' lassie,
W:    I could sit an' let her tease me for a week:
W: and the way she keeps behavin', well, I never pay for shavin',
W:    'Cause she rubs ma whiskers clean off with her cheek.
W: In the gloamin’ with my beauty, with my bonnie tutti frutti beauty,
W:    I like to wander by her side,
W: she’s my diamond, she’s my ruby, she’s my bonnie wee jujuby,
W:    And if she was here I’d revel in the pride.
W:--- CHORUS ---
