W: O you're a bird with golden wings,   A nightingale they say you are,
W: And one so rare, that when she sings Her notes are over par.
W: All other warblers stand aghast      And "spinning Jennies" are no go;
W: Old piping Boreas cries "avast!"     \AEolus sighs "oh, no!"
W:      Oh! Jenny Line &c.

W: The shops are full of Jenny Lind,      Her shawls and gloves are every where;
W: And dry-goods flaunt upon the wind,    Just such as Jenny's are.
W: No songs are sweet but those you sing, No shoes fit well without your name:
W: Your bonnet__ O that's just the thing  For miss or stately dame.
W:      Oh! Jenny Lind &c.

W:4.
W: My daughters__ they're all Jenny Lind, My own cravat has Jenny ties;
W: My wife around her neck has pinn'd     A kerchief with her eyes.
W: The cat and all her kittens too        To Jenny Lind's array belong;
W: And every time they howl or mew,       I feel the "power of song!"
W:      Oh! Jenny Lind &c.
