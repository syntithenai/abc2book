%% Enid Diamante
%% is a real fine fiddler from Philly who plays with the
%% S.P.U.D.S. Band, and she's also a member of a smaller group that
%% includes my friend Eddy Bonsall on the hammer dulcimer. I
%% always look forward to playing with her when I'm down that
%% way, and I hope it happens again real soon, Enid!
