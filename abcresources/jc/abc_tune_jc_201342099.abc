w:Where the swan swims so bon-ny, O.
W:A farmer there lived in the North Country
W:(Hey, ho, Nanny, O)
W:And he had daughters, one, two three
W:(Where the swan swims so bonny, O)
W:
W:These daughters they walked be the river's brim,
W:And the eldest pushed the youngest in.
W:
W:"Oh sister, oh sister, pray lend me your hand,
W:And I will give you house and land."
W:
W:"I'll neither give you hand nor glove,
W:Unless you give me your own true love."
W:
W:Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
W:Until she came to the miller's dam.
W:
W:The miller's daughter, being dressed in red,
W:She went to the water to make her bread.
W:
W:"O father, oh daddy, here swims a swan,
W:And its very like to a gentlewoman."
W:
W:They laid her on the bank to dry;
W:There came a harper passing by.
W:
W:He made a harp of her breast-bone,
W:And the harp began to play alone.
W:
W:He made harp-pins of her fingers so fair,
W:He made his harp-strings of her golden hair.
W:
W:He brought it to her father's hall;
W:There was the court assembled all.
W:
W:He laid the harp upon a stone
W:And straight it began to play alone.
W:
W:"O yonder sits my father the king,
W:And yonder sits my mother the queen.
W:
W:"And yonder sits my brother, Hugh,
W:And by him my William, sweet and true.
W:
W:"And there does sit my false sister, Anne,
W:Who drowned me for the dake of a man."
