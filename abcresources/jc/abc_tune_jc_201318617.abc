W:O 'twas in the broad Atlantic,
W:'Mid the equinoctial gales,
W:That a young fellow fell over board
W:Among the sharks and whales.
W:And down he went like a streak of light,
W:So quickly down went he,
W:Until he came to a mer-ma-id
W:At the bottom of the deep blue sea.

W:Britons never, never, never shall be
W:Marri-ed to a mer-ma-id

W:She raised herself on her beautiful tail,
W:And gave him her soft white hand,
W:I've long been waiting for you, my dear,
W:Now welcome safe to land.
W:Go back to your mess-mates for the last time
W:And tell them all from me,
W:That you're mar-ri-ed to a mer-ma-id
W:At the bottom of the deep blue sea.

W:We sent a boat to look for him
W:Expecting to find a corpse,
W:When he came up with a bang and a shout
W:And a voice sepulchrally hoarse:
W:"My comrades and my mess-mates,
W:O do not look for me,
W:For I'm mar-ri-ed to a mer-ma-id
W:At the bottom of the deep blue sea."
W:
W:The anchor was weighed and the sails unfurled,
W:And the ship was sailing free,
W:Went we went up to our cap-i-tain
W:And our tale we told to he.
W:The captain went to the old ship's side,
W:And out loud bellowed he,
W:"Be as happy as you can with your wife, my man,
W:At the bottom of the deep blue sea."
