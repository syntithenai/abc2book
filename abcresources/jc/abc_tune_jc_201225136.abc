%% Joe and Sam Herrmann have never had
%% a time all their own (at least, not in these little bookies.) They are two-thirds of
%% a wonderful musical group called "Critten Hollow" (The other third is Joe Fallon)
%% and this just seemed like the right time for their tune to show up here. I hope
%% they think so, too. If you see them before I do, tell 'em Bob said, "Let's go jam
%% with Joe and Sam!" (Jam and Go with Sam and Joe!?) Oh well - Best wishes
%% anyway and always to you guys. Can't wait to see you again.
