w:For to win the prize of a sil-ver pound, He must dance the world a-round.
W:On a harbour wall, in a sailor hat,
W:Is an old, old man with an old grey cat;
W:And he dreams all day of the time he twirled
W:In a sailor's hornpipe round the world.
W:It was many a weary year ago
W:When he started off on nimble toe
W:For to win the prize of a silver pound,
W:He must dance the world around.
W:
W:From the harbour wall he began his dance,
W:And he took the road on the way to France,
W:And his old grey cat, for she loved him so,
W:Did a hornpipe to on tail and toe:
W:They danced to the deck of a sailing brig
W:With a hornpipe first and then a jig
W:For to win that prize of a silver pound
W:They must dance the world around.
W:
W:Then the weeks went by, and the months grew long,
W:And he danced the native tribes among,
W:And the ju-ju men ran away in fear
W:As the twirling man and his cat drew near.
W:To the sandy wastes of Timbuctoo
W:They had sped along in a year or two,
W:For to win that prize of a silver pound
W:They must dance the world around.
W:
W:But the years went by on the harbour wall
W:And there came no news of the pair at all.
W:And the people sighed, and they said "That's that!"
W:And forgot Bill Bones and his faithful cat.
W:But when twenty years had passed away
W:Came an old, old man and a cat so grey
W:For to win that prize of a silver pound
W:They must dance the world around.
W:
W:Then the Mayor got up, and the Council too,
W:And they quickly asked, "Now who are you,
W:With your ragged clothes and your old black hat
W:And your tarred pig-tail and your dancing cat?"
W:"I'm Billy Bones and my feet are sore
W:And I never want to dance no more,
W:But I've come to claim that silver pound,
W:For I've danced the world around."
