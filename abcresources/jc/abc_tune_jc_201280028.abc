W: This hale and hearty warrior is worshipped in the ranks,
W: For he does his task inside the cask, as well as in the tanks.
W: He bears the brunt on every front, north, south, east, and west,
W: And he wears about ten million canteen medals on his chest.
W: He's good old General Guinness, he has won the world's applause.
W: 'Twas him who kept our spirits up in the midst of all our wars.
W: Who was the first to flirt with Mademoiselle from Armentieres?
W: Why good old General Guinness of the Dublin Booziliers.

W: And they love to gather 'round him, och, on every moonlit night.
W: He's good old General Guinness, he's as strong as Scottish broth,
W: 'Twas him who turned the Firth of Forth into the Firth of Froth.
W: All Scotsmen dance The Highland Fling and shout when he appears,
W: Hurrah! for General Guinness of the Dublin Booziliers.

W: His Convoy takes his liquid joy to Kerry and to Rome.
W: From Saint James's Gate he's never late, on his appointed round,
W: And no matter what the weather, sure, he never lets us down.
W: He's good old General Guinness, he's as good as Irish stew,
W: We all recall his war cry, "Guinness is Good For You."
W: So Irish men all raise a glass, and give three rousing cheers,
W: Hurrah! for General Guinness of the Dublin Booziliers!
