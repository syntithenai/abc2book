W:"Dumbarton's Drum" you wish to find;
W:The famous song first comes to mind
W:That Jean Redpath was want to croon
W:But could it be another tune?
W:
W:A forgotten air, like many more,
W:There's one solution: look up Gore!
W:If it's not in there I must insist
W:The tune you seek does not exist.
W:
W:Aha! I see it - just before
W:"Dumfries House" - good old Gore!
W:A fine old reel (but that high "c"
W:Does not endear the tune to me).
W:
W:So there you are, it might confuse;
W:The song or reel, you have to choose
W:If it's the former, let us know;
W:If it's the latter, see below.
