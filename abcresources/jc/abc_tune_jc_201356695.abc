W:Come Irishmen both young and stern
W:with adventure in your soul.
W:There are better ways to spend your days
W:than in working down a hole.
W:
W:  I was tall and true, all of 6 foot 2,
W:  but they broke me across the back.
W:  By a name I'm known and it's not my own:
W:  they call me Crooked Jack.
W:
W:The ganger's blue-eyed boy was I,
W:Big Jack could do no wrong.
W:And the reason simply was because
W:I could work hard hours and long.
W:
W:  I was tall and true...
W:
W:I've seen men old before their time,
W:their faces drawn and gray.
W:I never thought so soon would mine
W:be lined the self same way.
W:
W:  I was tall and true...
W:
W:I've cursed the day that I went away
W:to work on the hydro dams,
W:for sweat and tears or hopes and fears
W:bound up in shuttering jams.
W:
W:  I was tall and true...
W:
W:They say that honest toil is good
W:for the spirit and the soul.
W:But believe me boys it's for sweat and blood
W:that they want you down a hole.
W:
W:  I was tall and true...
