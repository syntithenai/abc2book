%% April Limber and I went out to Fiddle Tunes Dance Camp in Port Townsend, WA,
%% the last year that Frank Ferrel was there, back in the early eightys I think it was,
%% and there we met another wonderful fiddler named Peter Ostroushko.
%% Peter and I hit it off real well, and later he even wrote me a tune,
%% which I think was pretty nice of him. He's come east and played at concerts,
%% but so far I've had a gig myself every time he's been in the area.
%% I do so hope our paths will cross again, Peter - I look forward
%% to seeing you and hearing you play some more - 'til then, best wishes always -
