% % There's absolutely no tradition of hornpipe playing in the Highlands at all.
% % There's not one single hornpipe. So this is the original, first one. It's
% % dedicated to the West Highland Fiddle Class at Stirling University. It was
% % originally transcribed by Rosemary Stewart. Hornpipes are very, very nice
% % tunes to play because most of them are uncomplicated, although they can be
% % fancy, like the "Beeswing" and "Newcastle".
