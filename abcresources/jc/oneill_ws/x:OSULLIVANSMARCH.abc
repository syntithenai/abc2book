%
% The above is an involved variant of a much simpler jig tune of
% identical name printed in "Lynch's Melodies of Ireland 1845";
% and in "O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland 1907". The strain is
% ancient. Following is a quatrain of a folk song sung to it in
% the editor's boyhood days:
%         "There was an old woman tossed up in a blanket
%           Seventeen times as high as the moon;
%           What she was doing there I cannot imagine
%           But in her hand she carried a broom."
% All of which is reminiscent of the days of witchcraft.
