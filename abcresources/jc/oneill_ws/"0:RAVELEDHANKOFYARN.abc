% A few years ago as Mr. Leech was fingering a stray reel on his
% flute, Prof. John Cummings (mentioned on page 282-4, Irish
% Minstrels and Musicians) remarked "that's The Raveled Hank
% Of Yarn and I had forgotten it for the last forty years". Although
% then in his 85th year he buckled on his pipes, and played the
% tune in a style which astonished his audience. It is a variant
% of No. 638, O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland.
