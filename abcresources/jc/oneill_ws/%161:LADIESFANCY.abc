% This jig, a variant of the much more diversified "Yellow Wattle"
% No.353 in O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland, was sent to me by
% Prof. P.D. Reilly, a famous dancing master of "London and
% Castle Island", with the notation:
%          "This simple jig was a noted favorite among the two last
%              generations, and quite good enough for the present
%              when well played."
