% Among Carolan's many distinguished friends and patrons, no one
% was more generous and loyal than Mrs. McDermot Roe, of
% Alderford House, County Roscommon. At the outset of his
% professional career in 1693, it was she who equipped him
% with a horse and an attendant harper; and it was to her
% hospitable home he directed his feeble footsteps in his
% declining days. Exceptionally honored in death, Carolan's
% remains were interred near the family vault of his
% benefactress.
