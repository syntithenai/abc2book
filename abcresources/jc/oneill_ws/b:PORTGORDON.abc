%
% In "Hardiman's Irish Minstrelsy Vol.1", "Port Gordon"
% is listed as one of Carolan's compositions, and it is also
% attributed to him in "O'Farrell's Pocket Companion for
% the Irish or Union Pipes", from which the above setting
% was copied. Bunting, however, includes "Port Gordon"
% among the compositions of Rory Dall O'Cahan, a famous
% harper of the Western Highlands. The fact is that Carolan
% exercised his talents in retouching his predecessor's
% composition according to his own personal fancy.
% The setting which follows, taken from O'Neill's Music of
% Ireland was found among Sergt. James O'Neill's
% inherited manuscripts.
