% "Turkey in the Straw", or "Old Zip Coon", as played nowadays may
% suit the rapid movements of buckdancers, but the frenzied rhythm
% is ruinous to the melody. Rendered after the manner of the famous
% Dan Emmett of Bryant's Minstrels, in slow reel time, this popular tune
% acquires a much enhanced appeal. Emmett, it will be remembered,
% was the author of the immortal "Dixie", and it was his version of
% "Turkey in the Straw" which we obtained from John McFadden of
% the Chicago Irish Music Club , that is here presented.
% The origin of this favorite of our fathers is wrapped in even deeper
% mystery than that of "Yankee Doodle". Under the title "Old Zip
% Coon" the tune appeared in Howe's Collections about the middle
% of the 19th Century, and possibly earlier. The first gleam of light on
% the question of how the old title eventually yielded to the popularity
% of the new name, came through a chance conversation while fishing
% in 1920 with a northern tourist at Ocean Springs, Mississippi. The
% latter confidently informed me that Alderman Silas Leachman of
% Chicago, a native of Kentucky, was the author of "Turkey in the
% "Straw" - both words and music !  The melody I knew was older than
% the Alderman's grandfather, yet here was a lead worth investigating,
% for it was his melodious voice that first brought him to prominence.
% An interview with the talented official at Chicago a month later
% confirmed the statement that he was indeed the author of one song
% of that name, the best of several others on the same theme. One
% question was  settled. The popularity of the modern song relegated
% to obscurity the the named of the ancient tune. The pioneers or early
% settlers of West Virigina, Kentucky and Tennessee were largely of
% Irish ancestry, and obviously their music or tunes more or less varied
% by fancy, and defective memorizing from one generation to another,
% were of Irish origin. Fiddling and dancing being inseparable from all
% festivities and important events, the tunes became much more
% diversified, but the swing and spirit of the Gael however was always
% discernable in their reels and quadrilles, and so continues to the
% present day.
% For the convenience of musical antiquaries who may be interested
% in the subject, an old Irish March, or Jig, "The Kinnegad Slashers"
% to which is sung "The Land of Sweet Erin", is herewith submitted
% as a tune from which "Old Zip Coon" or "Turkey in the Straw"
% could have been derived or evolved. A third part added later by
% musicians is not essential in this illustration. [SEE TUNE #237B]
