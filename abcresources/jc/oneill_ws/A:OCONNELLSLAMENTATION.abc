%
% Comparing very favorably with compositions of this class, "O'Connell's
% Lamentation" is presented as the production of two members of the once
% famous Irish Music Club of Chicago which flourished in the early years
% of the twentieth century. The first and second parts were outline by
% John McFadden, an untutored fiddler of fertile fancy and dextrous
% execution. The third part as  well as the whole arrangement is the
% work of Sergt. James O'Neill, the club's worthy scribe.
