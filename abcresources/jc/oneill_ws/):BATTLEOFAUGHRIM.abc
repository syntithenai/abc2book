% To the musical antiquary war cries and battle pieces may not be
% without interest. To the modern ear they possess but little
% attraction; yet when Martin O'Reilly, the blind piper from Galway,
% at the Dublin feis in 1901 played a descriptive selection entitled
% "The Battle of Aughrim 1691" in which the blare of trumpets, battle
% onslaught, and wailing of the women were imitated, his performance
% was rapturously applauded.
