%
% In boyhood days I memorized the first part of this reel from the fiddl
%e
% playing of Mr. Downing a gentleman farmer who taught me the
% rudiments of music on the flute. Thirty-five years later the second
% part was supplied by A.S. Beamish, another West Cork musician.
% Being without a name the tune was called "Timothy Downing" or
% "Downing's Reel", in the O'Neill Collections. With a third part
% obtained from the famous fiddler John McFadden of Mayo, this
% tripartite reel is presented under its presumably true name.
