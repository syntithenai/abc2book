%
% Identical with the above setting of "Whistle o'er the Leave o't" is
% that printed in "Bremner's Collections of Scots Reels, or Country
% Dances 1757-61". Its claim to consideration in this work is based on
% the statement of Joseph Cant of Chicago, a first prize winner at
% several piping competitions; that it was the favorite tune for the
% Sean Truis or "Old Man's Dance" in his native Perthshire. The
% rhythm of it was deemed more suitable to the requirements of
% dancers burdened with years than the preceding tune .
% On such excellent authority it has been included in this
% classification.
