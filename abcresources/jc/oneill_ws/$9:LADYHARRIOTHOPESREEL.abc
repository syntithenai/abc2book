% I saw this tune in manuscript written in West Cork early in the
% 19th Century. The fact remains that it had been preserved in
% printer's ink in Bremner's Collection of Scots Reels, or Country
% Dances,  Edinburgh 1757. Its oldtime popularity is attested by
% its inclusion in several other worthy Collections long out of print,
% such as The Caledonian Muse 1785; and Neil Gow's and Sons'
% Complete Repository etc., 1805.
