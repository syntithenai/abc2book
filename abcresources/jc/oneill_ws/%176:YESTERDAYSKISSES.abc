%
% It may be permissable to abbreviate such an involved title as:
% "Sae Braely as I was kiss'd yestreen" into "Yesterday's Kisses"
% both for convenience and euphony, especially as the sentiment
% has not been clouded by the change. This jig preserved also in
% Aird's Selections, has been given circulation recently on the
% player-pianos.
