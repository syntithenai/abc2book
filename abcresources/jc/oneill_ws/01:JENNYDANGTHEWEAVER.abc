% This old time Scotch reel found in many publications, ancient and
% modern, first appeared in Bremner's Collections of Scots Reels or
% Country Dances 1757. The version of it as played by the famous
% Patsy Touhey on the Irish or Union pipes, much less cranky than
% the original and later versions, may be found interesting.
