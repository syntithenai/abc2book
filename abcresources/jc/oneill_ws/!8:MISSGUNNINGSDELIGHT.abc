% Well-born and of surprising loveliness only equalled by their poverty,
% the famous Gunning sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, born in Roscommon
% and educated in Dublin, became Lady Coventry, and Dutchess
% of Hamilton respectively, in 1752, one year after their arrival in
% London. The marriages of "two Irish girls of no fortune who are
% declared the handsomest women alive" were great public events.
% "May the Luck of the Gunnings attend you" was a proverbial Irish
% blessing.
% The above setting of a tune composed in their honor, and printed in
% Aird's Selection of Scotch, English, Irish and Foreign Airs, vol.-1,
% 1782 is doubtless the original. A highly elaborate and difficult
% variant in four parts found in Sergt. James O'Neill's manuscripts,
% entitled "The Contradiction" was printed in former O'Neill
% Collections.
% As an example of what may be developed from a simple composition
% by a skillful hand, both original and variant are herewith submitted
% for comparison.
