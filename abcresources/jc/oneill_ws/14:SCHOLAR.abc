% Long before I had any idea of publishing a work of this character,
% the fame of John Kelly, and Joseph P. Tamony, as phenomenal
% fiddlers, had reached Chicago. The measured score of their tunes,
% for which I am indebted to our mutual friend Francis E. Walsh of
% San Francisco, is incapable of doing justice to the spirit and
% excellence of their execution, for all gifted Irish musicians
% instinctively embellish their performance with peculiar trills, turns
% and graces, more easily recognized than described.
%    "The Scholar" was first printed in Levey's Dance Music of
% Ireland, Vol.1, London 1858; and not since then until the publication
% of the O'Neill Collections in recent years. The tune seems to have
% been a favorite with fiddlers and pipers of Longford, Leitrim and
% Roscommon, as early as the second quarter of the 19th Century;
% and, by the way, our talented contributor Mr Kelly hails from the
% latter county.
