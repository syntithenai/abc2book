% Not the least charming of the many airs and dance tunes, for which
% we are indebted to our liberal San Francisco contributor, Francis E.
% Walsh, is the fines Slumber Song above printed. It is an old strain
% of which variants under divers names gained wide circulation.
% Who hasn't heard the one time popular ballad about "my Love Nell
% from the Cove of Cork" and her inconstancy.  "Mary of Blackwater Side"
% one of the numbers in Joyce's Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, Dublin
%1909, betrays a similar origin.
