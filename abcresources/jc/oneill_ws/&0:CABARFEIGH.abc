% When first received with a batch of fine tunes noted down by our
% unselfish friend Francis E. Walsh from the playing of clever San
% Francisco musicians, the foregoing reel under a slightly different
% name was recognized as a variant of "Rakish Paddy" previously
% printed in The Music of Ireland, and O'Neill's Dance Music of
% Ireland. Another variant named "Sporting Pat" is to be found in
% O'Neill's Irish Music for Piano or Violin. Under the circumstances,
% another variant seemed superfluous, but coming from such a
% famous fiddler as John Kelly of Roscommon, it has been cheerfully
% welcomed to our pages.
% A favorite with all capable pipers and fiddlers of our acquaintance
% for many years, the tune under any of its recognized names does
% not appear in the Bunting, Petrie or Joyce publications. As
% "Caper Fey" it was printed in Bremner's Second Collection of Scots
% Reels or Country Dances, London 1768; yet omitted from The Glen
% Collection of Scottish Dance Music, Edinburgh 1891.
% Most Highland Bagpipe note books include a suitable setting of the
% tune under the correct title as above, in Gaelic and English.
