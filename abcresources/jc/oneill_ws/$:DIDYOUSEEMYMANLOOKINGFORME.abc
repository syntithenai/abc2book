% Of this old folk song, I remember the following verse:
%    Did you see my man,   He was a fine man ?
%    Did you see my man looking for me ?
%    He wore a green jacket, a pair of white stockings,
%    A hump on his back and he's blind in one eye;
%    a corduroy breeches; his brogues full of stitches
%    Did you see my man looking for me ?
