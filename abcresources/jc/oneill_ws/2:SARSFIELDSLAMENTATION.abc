% This lamentation derives its importance from the historical prominence
% of General Sarsfield as the Irish Commander at the Siege of Limeriick.
% That circumstance obviously accounts for its being confounded in later
% times with "Limerick's Lamentation". This composition bears no
% resemblance except in name to the "Lament for Sarsfield" No. 433 in
% O'Neill's Music of  Ireland, Chicago, 1903.
