%% Each January, dancers from all over the country attend the Ralph  Page  Dance
%% Legacy Weekend at the University of New Hampshire.  And every year we are all
%% made welcome by the smiling faces of Angie Taylor and Eleanor Strong, who  do
%% all  in  their  power  to  make certain that we are well-fed for the weekend.
%% Thanks loads, dear friends; you sure keep me and my tummy happy! :-)!
