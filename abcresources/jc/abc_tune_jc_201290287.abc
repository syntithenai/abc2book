w:It was down in yon-*der_ mea-dows I care-less-ly_ did stray;

w:There I be-held a la-dy fair with some young_ sail-*or gay.

w:To cross the bri-ny oc-ean in a Brit-ish man_ of war."
W:It was down in yonder meadows I carelessly did stray;
W:There I beheld a lady fair with some young sailor gay.
W:He said, "My lovely Susan, I soon must leave the shore,
W:To cross the briny ocean in a British man of war."
W:
W:Pretty Susan fell to weeping. "Young sailor," she did say,
W:"How can you be so venturesome to throw yourself away!
W:For it's when that I am twenty-one I shall receive my store;
W:Jolly sailor, do not venture on a British man of war."
W:
W:"Oh, Susan, lovely Susan, the truth to you I'll tell,
W:The British flag insulted is, old England knows it well.
W:I may be crowned with laurels, so like a jolly tar,
W:I'll face the walls of China in a British man of war."
W:
W:"Oh sailor, do not venture to face the proud Chinese,
W:For they will prove as treacherous as any Portuguese,
W:And by some deadly dagger you may receive a scar,
W:So it's turn your inclination from a British man of war."
W:
W:"Oh, Susan, lovely Susan, the time will quickly pass,
W:You come down to the ferryhouse to take a parting glass;
W:For my shipmates they are waiting to row me from the shore,
W:And its for old England's glory in a British man of war."
W:
W:The sailor took his handkerchief and cut it fair in two,
W:Saying "Susan, take one half from me, I'll do the same by you.
W:The bullets may surround me and cannons loudly roar,
W:I'll fight for fame and Susan in a British man of war."
W:
W:Then a few more words together when her love let go her hand.
W:A jovial crew, they launched the boat and merrily went from land.
W:The sailor waved his handkerchief when far away from shore;
W:Pretty Susan blessed her sailor in a British man of war.
