W: 1. Now how I came to get this hat, 'tis very strange and funny
W:    Grandfather died and left to me his property and money
W:    And when the will it was read out, they told me straight and flat
W:    If I would have his money, I must always wear his hat
W: CHORUS:
W:    "Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that tile?
W:    Isn't it a nobby one, and just the proper style?
W:    I should like to have one Just the same as that!"
W:    Where'er I go, they shout "Hello! Where did you get that hat?"
W:
W: 2. If I go to the op'ra house, in the op'ra season
W:    There's someone sure to shout at me without the slightest reason
W:    If I go to a concert hall to have a jolly spree
W:    There's someone in the party who is sure to shout at me
W:       CHORUS
W: 3. At twenty-one I thought I would to my sweetheart get married
W:    The people in the neighbourhood had said too long we'd tarried
W:    So off to church we went right quick, determined to get wed
W:    I had not long been in there, when the parson to me said
W:       CHORUS
W: 4. I once tried hard to be M.P. but failed to get elected
W:    Upon a tub I stood, round which a thousand folks collected
W:    And I had dodged the eggs and bricks (which was no easy task)
W:    When one man cried, "A question I the candidate would ask!"
W:       CHORUS
W: 5. When Colonel South, the millionaire, gave his last garden party
W:    I was amongst the guests who had a welcome true and hearty
W:    The Prince of Wales was also there, and my heart jumped with glee
W:    When I was told the Prince would like to have a word with me
W:       CHORUS
