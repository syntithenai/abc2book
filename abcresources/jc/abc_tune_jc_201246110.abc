W:
W:  All around my hat I will wear the green willow
W:  And all around my hat, for a twelvemonth and a day
W:  And if anyone should ask me the reason why I'm wearing it
W:  It's all for my true love who's far far away
W:
W:Fare thee well cold winter and fare thee well cold frost
W:Nothing have I gained but my own true love I've lost
W:I'll sing and I'll be merry when occasion I do see
W:He's a false deluding young man, let him go, farewell he
W:
W:  All around my hat...
W:
W:The other night he brought me a fine diamond ring
W:But he thought to have deprived me of a far better thing
W:But I being careful like lovers ought to be
W:He's a false deluding young man, let him go, farewell he
W:
W:  All around my hat...
W:
W:There's a quarter pound of reasons and a half pound of sense
W:A small sprig of time and small one of prudence
W:You mix them all together and you will plainly see
W:He's a false deluding young man, let him go, farewell he
W:
W:  All around my hat...

W:(Alternative lyrics:)
W:
W:My love she was fair, and my love she was kind
W:And cruel the judge and jury that sentenced her away
W:For thieving was a thing that she never was inclined to
W:They sent my love across the sea ten thousand miles away.
W:
W:  All around my hat, I will wear the green willow,
W:  All around my hat for a year and a day
W:  And if anyone should question me the reason for my wearing it
W:  I'll tell them that my own true love is ten thousand miles away.
W:
W:I bought my love a golden ring to wear upon her finger
W:A token of our own true love and to remember me
W:And when she returns again, we never will be parted
W:We'll marry and be happy for ever and a day.
W:
W:  All around my hat...
W:
W:Seven, seven long years my love and I are parted
W:Seven, seven long years my love is bound to stay
W:Seven long years I'll love my love and never be false-hearted
W:And never sigh or sorrow while she's far, far away.
W:
W:  All around my hat...
W:
W:Some young men there are who are preciously deceitful,
W:A-coaxin' of the fair young maids they mean to lead astray
W:As soon as they deceive them, so cruelly they leave them
W:I'll love my love forever though she's far, far away,
W:
W:  All around my hat...
