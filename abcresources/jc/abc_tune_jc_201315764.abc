W:First I loved Thomas, but now I love John,
W:Then I loved Edwin, he's a clever young man.

W:For fiddling and dancing is all my delight,
W:And keeping flash company has ruined me quite.
W:Runined me quite, and a great many more;
W:If I'd not kept bad company I'd never been so poor.
W:
W:Take this yellow handkerchief in rememberance of me,
W:And I hope you will wear it in your high company;
W:For in the middle of the ocean there shall grow a myrtle tree
W:Before ever I prove false to the girl that loves me.
W:
W:Here's adieu to you judges and juries, you are too severe;
W:You have banished my true love from me I declare.
W:May the rocks run water and the rivers run dry
W:If ever I prove false to the girl that loves I.
W:
W:If the wars should come again, love, what would old England say?
W:They would wish for the transports they have sent far away.
W:They would wish for the transports to return back again
W:To fight for old England their rights to maintain.
