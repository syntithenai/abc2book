%% An avid
%% dancer, Henriett\"e  lives in West Wilton,
%% a pretty little community the other side of
%% Temple Mountain from me. She never
%% misses a 1st Saturday Peterborough dance, and
%% sometimes her son, Einar, comes with her
%% when he's around. It's always a pleasure to see
%% you on the floor Henriett\"e!
