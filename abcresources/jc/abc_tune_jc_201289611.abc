W:When Mary birthed Jesus, 'twas in a cow's stall,
W:With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all.
W:But high from the heavens a star's light did fall,
W:And the promise of ages it then did recall.

W:If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing,
W:A star in the sky or a bird on the wing,
W:Or all of God's angels in heaven for to sing,
W:He surely could have had it,'cause he was the King.

W:How Jesus the Savior did come for to die
W:For poor on'ry people like you and like I...
W:I wonder as I wander, out under the sky.
