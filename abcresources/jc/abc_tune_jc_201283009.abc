w:There I be-held a *fair dam-sel And I wished in my heart she *was mine.
W:When first in this country
W:A strange curiosity caused me to roam
W:Over Europe resolved for to ramble
W:When I left Philadelphia my home
W:Until I came to old England
W:Where forms of great beauty do shine
W:There I beheld a fair damsel
W:And I wished in my heart she was mine.
W:
W:One morning I careless did ramble
W:Where the pure wind soft breezes did blow,
W:It was down by a pure crystal river
W:Where the sweet pearly waters did flow.
W:It was there I espied this fair creature,
W:Some goddess appearing to be
W:As she rose from the reeds by the water
W:On the green mossy banks of the Lea.
W:
W:I stepped up to this fair creature
W:Her fair cheeks did blush like a rose,
W:Says I "The green meadows are charming
W:Your guardian I'll be if you choose."
W:She said "Sir, I do not want no guardian,
W:Young man, you're a stranger to me.
W:And yonder my father is coming
W:O'er the green mossy banks of the Lea.
W:
W:I waited till up came her father,
W:I plucked up my spirits once more.
W:Saying "Kind sir, if this be your daughter,
W:She is the beautiful girl I adore.
W:Five thousand a year is my portion
W:And your daughter a lady shall be,
W:She shall ride in her chariot and horses
W:On the green mossy banks of the Lea."
W:
W:Then they welcomed me home to their cottage,
W:Soon after in wedlock we joined.
W:And there I entered a castle,
W:With grandeur and splendour did shine.
W:So now the American stranger
W:All pleasure and pastime doth see,
W:With adorable gentle Matilda,
W:On the green mossy banks of the Lea.
