w: I nev-er heard so sweet as the birds in the Spring.
W:One morning in May by chance I did rove,
W:I sat myself down by the side of a grove,
W:And there did I hear the sweet nightingale sing,
W:I never heard so sweet as the birds in the Spring.
W:
W:All on the green grass I sat myself down
W:Where the voice of the nightingale echoed around;
W:Don't you hear how she quivers the notes? I declare
W:No music, no songster with her can compare.
W:
W:Come all you young men, I'll have you draw near,
W:I pray you now heed me these words for to hear,
W:That when you're grown old you may have it to sing,
W:That you never heard so sweet as the birds in the Spring.
