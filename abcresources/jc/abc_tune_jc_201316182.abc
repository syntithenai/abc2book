W:And from that time, through wildest woe,   That hope has shone a far light,
W:Nor could love's brightest summer glow   Outshine that solemn starlight;
W:It seemed to watch above my head   In forum, field and fane,
W:Its angel voice sang round my bed,   A Nation once again!
W:   Chorus.
W:It whisper'd too, that freedom's ark   And service high and holy,
W:Would be profaned by feelings dark   And passions vain or lowly;
W:For, Freedom comes from God's right hand,   And needs a Godly train;
W:And righteous men must make our land   A Nation once again!
W:   Chorus.
W:So, as I grew from boy to man,   I bent me to that bidding
W:My spirit of each selfish plan   And cruel passion ridding;
W:For, thus I hoped some day to aid,   Oh, can such hope be vain ?
W:When my dear country shall be made   A Nation once again!
W:   Chorus.
