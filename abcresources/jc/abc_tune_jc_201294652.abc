W:As I was a-walking in the sweet month of May
W:A jovial young sailor by chance passed that way,
W:He was stalwart and handsome; as he pass-ed by,
W:I beckoned unto him and bade him draw nigh.
W:
W:"What is your name, sir, and what is your trade,
W:And in what part of America have you lately surveyed,
W:And where is your last place you made your abode,
W:And what is the reason for travelling this road?"
W:
W:"Willie is my name, I'm a sailor by trade,
W:And in all parts of America I have lately surveyed,
W:In the city of New York I have made my abode,
W:And I hope it's no harm I am travelling this road?"
W:
W:"Willie, I'll have you to stay here and tarry,
W:And perhaps by your countenance some girl you might marry,
W:And perhaps some great fortune may increase your store,
W:For Willie, I want you to wander no more."
W:
W:"I would not leave rambling for thousands or more,
W:You can see by my rambling I have money in store,
W:I have gold in my pocket and silver likewise",
W:Like an innocent girl the tears came from his eyes.
W:
W:"O Willie, I'll have you for to marry me,
W:I've men and rich servants for to wait upon thee,
W:And a coach and six horses at your leisure may ride,
W:And Willie, I'll have you to make me your bride."
W:
W:To the church they did go on the very same day,
W:And there they got married without further delay,
W:A handsomer couple you never have seen
W:Than Willie the sailor and his beautiful queen.
