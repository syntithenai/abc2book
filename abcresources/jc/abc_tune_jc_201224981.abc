%% Dana Wells has been dancing for years.
%% He was a good friend of New England Tradition, and he's been on my "tune
%% list" for a long while. He recently sent me a tape of the Canterbury
%% playing back in '74 and '75, and it was fun to listen to, bringing
%% back so many happy memories. Thanks a lot, Dana - That was
%% awfully nice of you!
