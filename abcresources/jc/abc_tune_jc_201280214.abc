W:As I went over London's Bridge,
W:'Twas early in the morning,
W:There I spied a pretty fair maid
W:Pleading for the life of Georgie.
W:
W:"Go saddle me up my milk-white steeds
W:And bridle them so gaily,
W:That I may ride to the king castle town
W:And plead for the life of Georgie."
W:
W:She rode all day and she rode all night
W:Till she was weak and weary;
W:While throwing back her fie yellow hair
W:She plead for the life of her Georgie."
W:
W:She pulled from her pocket a purse of gold,
W:Saying, "Here is money a-plenty;
W:Lawyers, lawyers, fee yourselves
W:And spare me the life of Georgie."
W:
W:Up stepped George then unto the lawyer,
W:Saying, "I have not murdered any,
W:But I stole sixteen of the king's white steeds
W:And sold them in Boheny."
W:
W:Up stepped the lawyer then to George,
W:Saying, "George, I'm sorry for you,
W:But your own confesssion has condemned you to die,
W:May the Lord have mercy upon you."
W:
W:George shall be hung with a golden cord,
W:Of such there is not many,
W:Because he came from a royal race
W:And courted a handsome lady.
W:
W:I wish I was over on yon hillside
W:Where kisses are a-plenty,
W:With a sword and pistol by my side
W:I would fight for the life of Georgie.
