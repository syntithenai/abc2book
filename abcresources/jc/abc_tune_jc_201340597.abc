W:2. As she onward sped, I shook my head,
W:And I gazed with a feeling rare.
W:And I said, says I, to a passer-by,
W:"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"
W:He smiled at me, and with pride says he,
W:"That's the gem of all Ireland's crown,
W:Young Rosie McCann, from the banks of the Bann.
W:She's the Star of the County Down."

W:3. At the harvest fair, she'll be surely there.
W:So, I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
W:With my shoes shined bright, and my hat just right,
W:I'll win the heart of the nut-brown Rose.
W:No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke,
W:And my plow will rust and brown,
W:'Til a smiling bride by my own fireside
W:Sits the Star of the County Down.
W:(Chorus, 2x)
