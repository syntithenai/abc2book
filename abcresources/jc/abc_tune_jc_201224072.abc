%% This is the
%% third tune, and the last one in this group. It is for my
%% dear cousin Jimmy Martinez. Neither he nor Eddy will
%% ever hear their tunes, since they are both gone now, but
%% the bond between us all still survives; such is the
%% power of love. I will play these for you some day, Cathy!
