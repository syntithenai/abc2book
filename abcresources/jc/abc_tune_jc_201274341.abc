w:On the top of yon-der moun-tain Where the fin-est flow-ers grow.
W:The lambs they skip with pleasure,
W:And the meadows are so green
W:One of the finest mountains
W:That ever eyes have seen.
W:There's fine hunting, fine fishing,
W:And fine fowling also
W:On the top of yonder mountain
W:Where the finest flowers grow.

W:On the top of yonder mountain
W:There my true love's castle stands
W:It is deck-ed up with ivy
W:From the top down to the strands.
W:There's fine arches, fine porches,
W:And there diamond stones so bright,
W:It's a pilot for the sailors
W:On a dark and stormy night.
W:
W:At the bottom of the mountain
W:There's a river runs so clear,
W:And a ship from the West Indies
W:Once lay at anchor there;
W:With a red flag a-flying
W:And the beating of a drum
W:Sweet instruments of music,
W:And the firing of a gun

W:If little Mary had proved faithful
W:She might have been my bride,
W:But her mind it was more fickle
W:Than the rain upon the tide,
W:Like a ship upon the ocean
W:That is tossed to and fro,
W:May the angels now direct her
W:Wherever she may go!
