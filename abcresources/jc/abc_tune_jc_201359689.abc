W:What then is love but mourning,
W:What desire, but a self-burning,
W:Till she that hates doth love return,
W:  Thus will I mourne,
W:  Thus will I sing,
W:Come away, come away my darling.
W:
W:Beauty is but a blooming,
W:Youth in his glory entombing,
W:Time hath a while which none can stay,
W:  Then come away
W:  While thus I sing,
W:Come away, come away my darling.
W:
W:Summer in winter fadeth,
W:Gloomy night heav'nly light shadeth,
W:Like to the morn are Venus' flow'rs,
W:  Such are her hours
W:  Then I will sing,
W:Come away, come away my darling.
