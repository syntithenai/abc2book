w:But soon you'll hear this maid-en fair did prove his o-ver-throw.
W:This is of a farmer's daughter,
W:Most beautiful, I'm told;
W:Her parents died and left to her
W:A large amount of gold.
W:She lived with her uncle,
W:Th' cause of all her woe;
W:But soon you'll hear this maiden fair
W:Did prove his overthrow.
W:
W:Her uncle had a plow-boy,
W:Young Mary loved him well,
W:An' in her uncle's garden
W:Their tales of love would tell.
W:There was a wealthy squire
W:That oft her came to see,
W:But still she loved her plow-boy
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee.
W:
W:Her uncle an' the squire
W:Rode out one summer's day,
W:He knocked at this fair maid's door
W:An' unto her did say,
W:"Arise, arise, my pretty maid,
W:A lady you may be;
W:The squire is waitin' for you
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee."
W:
W:"I care not for no squires,
W:Nor dukes nor lords likewise;
W:My Willie's eyes appear to me
W:Like diamonds in the skies."
W:"Begone, unruly female,
W:You ne'er shall happy be;
W:I intend to banish Willie
W:From the banks of sweet Dundee."
W:
W:Her uncle an' the squire
W:Rode out one summer's day,
W:Young Willie was in favor,
W:Her uncle he did say.
W:"Indeed, it's my intention
W:To tie him to a tree,
W:An' then to bribe the press-gang
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee."
W:
W:A press-gang came to William
W:When he was all alone;
W:He boldly fought for liberty
W:But they was six to one.
W:The blood did flow in torrents,
W:"Pray kill me now," says he,
W:"An' I will die for Mary
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee."
W:
W:This maid was out a-walkin',
W:Lamentin' for her love.
W:When she met the wealthy squire
W:Down in her uncle's grove.
W:He put his arms around her,
W:"Stand off, base man," says she,
W:"For you have sent the lad I love
W:From the banks of sweet Dundee."
W:
W:He put his arms around her
W:An' tried to throw her down;
W:Two pistols an' a sword she saw
W:Beneath his morning gown.
W:She took the weapons from him,
W:The sword he used so free,
W:An' she did fire an' killed the squire
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee.
W:
W:Her uncle overheard the noise
W:An' hastened to the ground,
W:Sayin', "Since you've went an' killed the squire
W:I'll give you your death wound."
W:"Stand off again," cried Mary,
W:"Undaunted I will be."
W:She the trigger drew an' her uncle slew
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee.
W:
W:A doctor soon was sent for,
W:A man of noble skill,
W:An' there then come a lawyer
W:For him to sign his will.
W:He willed his gold to Mary,
W:Who fought so manfully;
W:Then he closed his eyes, no more to rise
W:On the banks of sweet Dundee.
