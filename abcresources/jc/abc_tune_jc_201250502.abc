W:As John was hurrying down the glade,
W:He met his sweetheart Kit;
W:"O whither so fast?" the maiden asked,
W:Lets bide and talk a bit?"
W:"I'm going to the barn, and if you'll come,
W:And help me thresh the stro',
W:That task complete, why then my sweet,
W:A ramble we will go."
W:
W:She gave consent, and to work they went,
W:As if 'twere only play;
W:The flail he plied, whilst Kit untied,
W:The sheaves, and cleared away.
W:O willing hands made labour light,
W:And 'ere the sun was low,
W:With arms entwined, these lovers kind,
W:Did down the vallies go.
W:
W:Said Jan, "thou art a helpful lass,
W:Wilt thou be mine for life?"
W:"For sure!" she said. To church they sped,
W:And soon were man and wife.
W:A lesson then, for all young men
W:Who would a courting go,
W:Your sweetheart ask to share your task,
W:And thresh the Barley Stro'
W:
W:Now many a year, this couple dear,
W:They lived in harmony;
W:And children had, both lass and lad,
W:I think 'twas thirty three.
W:The sons so hale did wield the flail,
W:And like their father grow;
W:The maidens sweet, like mother were neat:
W:And clean as the Barley Stro'.
