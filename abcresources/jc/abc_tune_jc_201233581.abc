T:My Sorrow and Trouble
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:From the singing of Joe Martin of Kilfinane Co. Limerick, 1852.
H:He sang an Irish song to it, of which this is the first verse:
W:Mo chreach a's mo dh\'iachairt gan ce\'o draoichte air na b\'oithribh,
W:A's go siubhalfhainn san o\'idhche le'm chroidhe geal na gl\'oire.
W:Mo ph\'ocaidhe bheith a l\'ionadh le geal ph\'isidhe cr\'oineach,
W:N\'a s\'asacht s\'ud dom'inntinn agus l\'uidhe s\'os le c\'obach.
W:
W:Alas and alas, that there is not a fairy-fog on the roads,
W:And that I might walk in the night with thy fair sweetheart of glory.
W:If my pockets were to be filled with white crown pieces--
W:That would  not content my mind, and to be married to a clown.

T:R\'aisiona Bhl'-a-hubhla
T:The Races of Ballyhooly
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  From memory, as I learned in my young days.  The Irish song that gave
H:name to this fine air--of which I heard fragments in my youth--commemorated
H:the fate of a number of peasants who were shot down in the neighbourhood of
H:Ballyhooly near Fermoy Co. Cork, while resisting the collection of tithes,
H:early in the last century (about 1825).  The poet utters a prophecy, which
H:has come to pass, that the particular church for which these tithes were
H:assessed would be levelled, till not one stone remained on another.
H:  I have a copy of the whole song written in English letters phonetically;
H:but it is such gibberish that I can make nothing of it.  The first line
H:however is plain enough: T\'a sgeul agum an innsinnt s'n\'a smuainim gur
H:breug \'e: "I have a tale to tell, and I don't think it is a false one."

B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:  In the year 1852 when I was busy drawing up from my memory, for Dr.
H:Petrie, all the airs I could thing of--and for that purpose commonly
H:carried a bit of music paper in my waistcoat pocket--I woke up from sleep
H:one night whistling this fine air in a dream: an air which I had forgotten
H:for years.  Greatly delighted, I started up: a light, a pencil, and bit of
H:paper, and there was the first bar securely captured: the bird was, as it
H:were, caught and held by the tail.  I have never seen this air written
H:elsewhere, except in one Co. Limerick Ms., where this setting however is
H:inferior to miune.  I give it here from acient memory.
W:Oh, didn't you hear of the glorious news
W:  That happened at Ballyhooly:
W:Dan Tutty the gauger was caught and thrashed
W:  By Paddy and Timothy Dooly.

H:a ballad-sheet copy of the whole song, but the first and last verses will be
H:sufficient here.  I write the air from memory.
H:  I often heard the Limerick people sing to this air Byron's two-verse poem
H:beginning "I saw thee weep".
W:As I roved out one morning down by a river side,
W:To catch some trout and salmon where the stream did gently glide;
W:Down by the brook my way I took and there by chance did spy
W:A lovely maid all in the shade, who smiled and passed me by.
W:
W:With hand in hand we walked along down by her father's place;
W:Her parents they were satisfied when first they saw my face.
W:The banns were quickly published and joined we were for life:
W:So instead of trout or salmon--O, I caught a virtuous wife.

H:married, but were not, were marked with a heavy streak of chalk on the back
H:of the Sunday coat, by boys who carried bits of chalk in their pockets for
H:that purpose, and lay in wait for the bachelors.  The marking was done while
H:the congregation were assembling for Mass: and the young fellow ran for his
H:life, always laughing, and often singing the concluding words of some
H:suitable doggerel such as: "And you are not married though Lent has come!"
H:This custom prevailed in some parts of Limerick, where I saw it in full
H:play: but I think it has died out.

T:Ye Natives of the Nation
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:  To this air there was a violent political and Jacobite song, composed by a
H:man named Barnaby O'Hanlon, a turner, a native of Donegal, who settled down
H:and worked in our neighbourhood for some time.  I learned both air and words
H:in my childhood by merely hearing the people about me singing the song.  I
H:give two half verses here; but I have a full copy.
W:  Our ancestors formerly great valour they have shown,
W:  Great exploits for Ireland's rights since James's war was known;
W:  Likewise the valiant Sarsfield his losses did bemoan,
W:  When he reproved St. Ruth for the losing of Athlone.
W:
H:  Referring to the destruction of King William's artillery train by
H:Sarsfield (Lord Lucan), during the siege of Limerick, this peasant song
H:has the following striking passage:
W:  We rode with brave Lord Lucan before the break of day,
W:  Until we came to Kinmagown where the arttillery lay;
W:  Then God He cleared the firmament, the moon and stars gave light,
W:  And for the battle of the Boyne we had revenge that night.
H:See the ballad in "Ballads of Irish Chivalry," by Robert. D. Joyce, M.D.,
H:p. 11.  Any History of Ireland will tell about the loss of Athlone and
H:the destruction of King William's siege train.

T:Lament for Donoch an Bhaile-aodha
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  The Irish ode, or lament, of which the following is the air, was sung for
H:me by Phil Gleeson: but there is no need to give it here, as it will be
H:found in Hardiman's "Irish Minstrelsy," vol. ii, p. 272.  It was composed by
H:a well-known Munster Gaelic poet of the 18th century, Timothy O'Sullivan,
H:commonly called Tadhg Gaodhlach, "Timothy of the Irish Compositions," to
H:commemorate the death of Donogh Mac Carthy of Ballea Castle near
H:Carrigaline, 8 miles S.E. of Cork.
H:  As to Phil Gleeson's traditional manner of singing the ode--which he
H:learned of course from older people:--To the note D at the end of the air he
H:chanted, in monotone, a sort of cronaun consisting simply of the continued
H:repetition of the two vowel sounds, ee-oo ee-oo ee-oo, &c., which was
H:prolonged ad libitum: the change from ee to oo being made at intervals of
H:about a crotchet.  Occasionally he ended the cronaun by suddenly sliding his
H:voice up to a third, fifth, or octave--a common practice in laments, nurse
H:tunes, plough whistles, &c.

H:
H:  There is a song to this air written by Patrick O'Kelly, a wandering
H:peasant poet of the beginning of the last century, who discloses his name in
H:the last verse: a custom found in other songs.  (For a notice of him see my
H:"Social History of Ancient Ireland," I. 451.)
Though many there be that daily I see
W:  Of virtuous beautiful creatures,
W:With red rosy cheeks and ruby lips,
W:  And likewise comely features:
W:Yet there is none abroad or at home
W:  In country or town or plantation,
W:That can be compared to this maiden fair--
W:  The Pearl of th'Irish Nation.
W:
W:P was a part and A was an art,
W:  And T was a teacher of strangers,
W:R, I, and C make number three,
W:  And K will be keeper of my chambers.
W:K will be king when E cannot reign,
W:  Double L will lie in its station:
W:Y will be young and in perfect bloom--
W:  The Pearl of th'Irish Nation.

W:"It was a cold and stormy night"--those sad words she did say--
W:"When my love went on the raging main, bound for Amerikay.
W:
W:"My love he was a fisherman, his age was scarce eighteen,
W:"He was a handsome young man as ever yet was seen:
W:"My father he has riches great, and O'Reilly was but poor,
W:"And because he was a fisherman he could not him endure.
W:
W:"Says my mother then to me: `My dear, this case is bad indeed,
W:"`Therefore my loving daughter I hope you will take heed;
W:"`If you be fond of Reilly, let him leave this counterie,

T:Mairghread na R\'oiste
T:Margaret Roche
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  Bunting gives two settings of this air, which he calls R\'ois\'in dubh
H:(The Little Black Rose).  But it is universally known all over Munster as
H:Mairghread na R\'oiste: and I believe that Bunting has given it a wrong
H:name.  The air called R\'oisin dubh, which is known, not only in Munster,
H:but all over Ireland, is entirely different.  It will be found in Petrie's
H:Ancient Music of Ireland, in a major setting; and in my "Irish Music and
H:Song," in its proper minor setting.  The setting I give here of Mairghread
H:na R\'oiste differs a good deal from both Bunting's settings of the air he
H:(wrongly) calls R\'oisin Dubh.  It is more purely vocal.  It has remained in
H:my memory since boyhood, with the first verse of the Irish song, which tells
H:a sad story.  Margaret Roche was condemned to be burned alive for murder.
H:On her condemnation her brother set out post haste for Dublin and was
H:successful in obtaining a reprieve, but arrived home just an hour too late.
H:He then composed a lament of which I give the first verse.
W:A Mh\'airghr\'ead, a Mh\'airghr\'ead, a Mh\'airghr\'ead, na R\'oiste
W:Na g-croibhne geala, na bh-f\'innighe \'ordha:

B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  Taken down in 1876 from the singing of James Keane of Kilkee, who was then
H:83 years of age; whose memory was richly stored with Irish music, and with
H:songs both in Irish and English.  He told me at the time, with the greatest
H:confidence and cheerfulness, that he had two years more to live, as his
H:father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all died at 85.  Slieve Elva a
H:mountain in Clare.

T:I Bridled My Nag
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:Air and words I learned in early life from hearing the people sing the song.
H:The hero was evidently what sporting people now call a "welsher."
W:I bridled my nag and away I did ride
W:Till I came to an alehouse hard by a town side,
W:There I saw three gentlemen throwing at dice,
W:And they took me to be some noble knight:
W:    With a right fol-ol de diddle, right fol-lee,
W:    And in my pocket but one pen-nee.
W:
W:I ordered a quart of the beer that was strong,
W:And in that quart I ordered a dram*;
W:I fell drinking and they looking on,
W:And they took me to be some nobleman:
W:                              Chorus.
W:
W:I took the dice and I threw one,
W:And as it happened I chanced to win:
W:If they should win and I to lose,
W:What had they to take but an empty purse:
W:    With my right fol-ol de diddle right fol-lee
W:    And in my pocket I've gold plen-tee.
H:* That is, a glass of whiskey.  This mixture, commonly seasoned with a
H:shake of paper, is what the country people used to call "powder and ball."

H:she was then 90 years of age: and she told me that she learned it by hearing
H:it played on the violin by her grandmother.  There is a setting in
H:Stanford-Petrie: but the version I give here is considerably different, and
H:is, I think, much finer.  This was a "Piece", i.e., an instrumental tune
H:somewhat longer and more elaborate than the ordinary 2- or 3-Part airs.

H:given here.
W:Sl\'an do chuirim o'm chroidhe leat, a bhaile tar taoide anonn,--
W:Go gleannt\'an Araglin aoibhinn mar a scaiptheare an fionn 'sa leann;

W:Translation:
W:I send a farewell from my heart to thee, thou little spot over there beyond the sea,
W:To the pretty little vale of Araglin, where the wine and the ale are plentifully poured out.
W:Sweeter to me was the cry of the hounds there, on a m ild misty morning,

T:Loch Na Garr
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:Byron's "Loch na Garr" was often sung by the Limerick people to the
H:following slow Irish air, which may be compared with "The Bunch of Green
H:Rushes that Grew At the Brim" (Moore's "This life is all chequered").
R:song air
N:  [Here are the words to Byron's poem, typed in by your editor Earendil]
W:    Ah! There my young footsteps in infancy wander'd;
W:    My cap was the bonnet, my cloak was the plaid;
W:    On chieftans long perish'd, my memeory ponder'd
W:    As daily I strode through the pine cover'd glade,
W:    I sought not my home till the day's dying glory
W:    Gave place to the rays of the bright polar star;
W:    For fancy was cheered by tradional story,
W:    Disclosed by the natives of dark Loch na Garr
W:
W:    Years have rolled on, Loch na Garr, since I left you,
W:    Years must elapse ere I tread you again;
W:    Nature of verdure and flow'rs has bereft you
W:    Yet still you are dearer than Albions plain.
W:    England, thy beauties are tame and domestic
W:    To one who roved o'er the mountains afar;
W:    Oh for the crags that are wild and majestic!
W:    The steep frowning glories of dark Loch na Garr.

R:song
L:1/4
N:  I give this fine air as I learned it in early days from singers; but an
N:instrumental setting, much ornamented, will be found in Bunting, 1840, page
N:66.  It is there given in the major; but I always heard it sung and played
N:in the minor.  There was an Irish song to it of which I remember the first
N:verse.
N:
W:A bhean-a'-tighe sh\'eimh cuir ad\'eirc amach cun a doill;
W:Beidh mo phaidir chun D\'e a-cur s\'eun agus rath air do chloinn:
W:D\'a m-beidh mo bhean agum fh\'ein ni bheith mo l\'eint\'in dithte
W:                                            air mo dhru\'im;
W:A's go bh-fuil s\'i a g-Cill-teun, mo leun, agus leac air a dru\'im.
W:
W:O gentle woman of the house, give alms to the blind man;
W:My prayer to God will be to give prosperity and good luck to your children:
W:If I had my own wife my shirt would not be soiled [as it is] on my back;
W:But alas, she lies in Kiltane with a stone at her head.
W:
N:  Of this whole song there was a free translation, which was very
N:generally known and sung, of which I can recall the following three verses.
N:They give an admirable picture of the sturdy professional beggarman, as he
N:flourished, and as I well remember him, before 1847.
W:
W:Of all trades a-going, begging it is my delight:
W:My rent it is paid and I lay down my bags ev'ry night:
W:I'll throw away care and take a long staff in my hand,
W:And I'll flourish each day courageously looking for chance.
W:
W:With my belt round my shoulder and down my bags they do hang;
W:With a push and a jolt it's quickly I'll have them yoked on;
W:With my horn by my side, likewise my skiver and can;
W:With my staff and long pike to fight the dogs as I gang.
W:
W:To patterns and fairs I'll go round for collection along,
W:I'll seem to be lame and quite useless of one of my hands.
W:Like a pilgrim I'll pray each day with my hat in my hand,
W:And at night in the alehouse I'll stand and pay like a man.

T:The Enchanted White Duck
R:song
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:  A little boy is changed by draoidheacht or enchantment into a white duck,
H:and in this disguise he is killed and eaten by his own family.  Our servant
H:Biddy Hickey used to tell the whole story, sometimes reciting, sometimes
H:singing, sometimes chanting in a monotone: but it has all faded from my
H:memory except the following weird little fragment with its tune, which took
H:strong hold of my childhood fancy.
H:  The English folk-tale called "The Story of Orange" (for which see "Journ.
H:of the Folk-Song Soc.", Vol. II, p. 295) corresponds with this, and some
H:versions of the words come very close to the verse I give here.  But there
H:is nothing in the English air that in the least resembles our Irish tune.
W:My mamma cut me and put me in the pot;
W:My dada said I was purty and fat;
W:My three little sisters they picked my small bones
W:And buried them under the marble stones.

T:The Eagle's Whistle
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:I copied the following 11 airs (to "Drimin Donn Dilis") from a MS. book lent
H:me by Surgeon-Major-General King of Dublin (about 1885), who copied them 40
H:years previously from an old MS. book in Cork.
H:
H:I gave a setting of this in my "Ancient Irish Music": and there are two
H:others in the Stanford-Petrie Collection.  These three are in 3/4 time:
H:whereas the setting I now give is in 2/4, which is no doubt the proper
H:original form, inasmuch as this was the marching tune of O'Donovans (See my
H:"Ancient Irish Music", p. 53).  The Cork MS. has this remark:
H:  "The legend tells that with this tune the eagle whistles his young
H:   to rest."
