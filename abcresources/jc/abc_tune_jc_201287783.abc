W:"Now take me up behind you fair maid for to ride",
W:"Oh no and then, Oh no, for my mammy she would chide,
W:And then my dear old daddy would beat me full sore,
W:And never let me ride on his grey mare no more."
W:
W:"If you would see Horn Fair you must walk on your way,
W:I will not let you ride on my grey mare today,
W:You'd rumple all my muslin and uncurl my hair,
W:And leave me all distrest to be seen at Horn Fair."
W:
W:"O fairest of damsels, how can you say No?
W:With you I do intend to Horn Fair for to go,
W:We'll join the best of company when we do get there,
W:With horns on their heads, boys, the finest at the Fair."
