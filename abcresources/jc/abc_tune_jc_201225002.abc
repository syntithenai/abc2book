%% You've been reading quite a lot about Augusta in these
%% little books; that's because the Augusta Experience is such a wonderful happening in a
%% person's life. Irish week is spectacular (perhaps no more so than the other weeks) with
%% great people and great music. The Coen Brothers have a lot to do with that; Jack is a
%% great Galway-style flute player, and his brother, Father Charlie Coen, is one of the very best
%% concertina players ever. We are all so lucky to have musicians of this caliber to
%% listen to and learn from. We're so glad you're at Augusta, Father Charlie!
