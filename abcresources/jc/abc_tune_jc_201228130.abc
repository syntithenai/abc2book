%% Sally Freund is truly a
%% dear friend of many years. She directs the Elderhostel
%% Program during Dance Week at Augusta. She schedules a
%% yearly mini-concert for me to come and tell a few stories
%% and play a few tunes on the accordion. It's such a joy to do
%% this and I look forward to it so much, Sally; it's always a
%% pleasure to be there with you.
