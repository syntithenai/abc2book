W:On Monday morn I married a wife,
W:I thought to live a sober life.
W:As it fell out I were better dead,
W:Than mark the time when I was wed.
W:Laddy-heigh-ho! Laddy-heigh-ho!
W:Fal-de-ral-li-do! Laddy-heigh-ho!
W:
W:On Tuesday morning to my surprise,
W:A little before the sun did rise,
W:She rattled her clapper, and scolded more,
W:Than ever I heard in my life before.
W:Laddy-heigh-ho! &c.

W:On Wednesday morning I went to the wood,
W:I thought to do my wife some good.
W:I cut me a twig of holly green,
W:I trust the toughest I'd ever seen.
W:Laddy-heigh-ho! &c.
W:
W:I hung the stick up well to dry,
W:I thought on Thursday it to try,
W:I laid it about her head and back,
W:Before my twig began to crack.
W:Laddy-heigh-ho! &c.
W:
W:On Friday morning to my surprise,
W:A little before the sun did rise,
W:She rattled her clapper in scolding tone,
W:I turn'd my back and left her alone.
W:Lady-heigh-ho! &c.
W:
W:On Saturday morn, as I may say,
W:As she on her pillow consulting lay,
W:A bogie arrived in fume and flame,
W:And carried her off both blind and lame.
W:Laddy-heigh-ho! &c.
W:
W:On Sunday, neighbours, I dine without
W:A scolding wife and a brawling rout;
W:Enjoy my bottle, and my best friend,
W:And surely this is a brave week?s end.
W:Lady-heigh-ho! &c.
