W:
W:In a neat little town they call Belfast
W:apprentice to trade I was bound.
W:Many an hours sweet happiness
W:have I spent in that neat little town.
W:
W:A sad misfortune came over me
W:which caused me to stray from the land,
W:far away from my friends and relations,
W:betrayed by the black velvet band.
W:
W:  Her eyes they shone like diamonds,
W:  I thought her the queen of the land,
W:  and her hair it hung over her shoulder
W:  tied up with a black velvet band.
W:
W:I took a stroll down Broadway
W:meaning not long for to stay,
W:when who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
W:comes a tripping along the highway.
W:
W:She was both fair and handsome,
W:her neck it was just like a swans;
W:And her hair it hung over her shoulder,
W:tied up with a black velvet band.
W:
W:  Her eyes they shone like...
W:
W:I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid,
W:and a gentleman passing us by.
W:Well I knew she meant the doing of him
W:by the look in her roguish black eye.
W:
W:A goldwatch she took from his pocket
W:and placed it right in to my hand,
W:and the very first thing that I said was:
W:"Bad luck to the black velvet band."
W:
W:  Her eyes they shone like...
W:
W:Before the judge and the jury
W:next morning I had to appear.
W:The judge he says to me: "Young man,
W:your case it is proven clear.
W:
W:We'll give you seven years penal servitude
W:to be spent faraway from the land;
W:Far away from your friends and companions,
W:betrayed by the black velvet band."
W:
W:  Her eyes they shone like...
W:
W:So come all you jolly young fellows,
W:a warning take by me:
W:When you are out on the town me lads,
W:beware of them pretty colleens.
W:
W:For they feed you with strong drink, "Oh yeah",
W:'til you are unable to stand,
W:and the very next thing that you'll know is
W:aou've landed in Van Diemens Land.
W:
W:  Her eyes they shone like...
