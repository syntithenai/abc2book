%% "Shetland's Young Heritage"
%% is a wonderful group of young fiddlers who derive their
%% skills from great teacher and fiddler, Dr. Tom Anderson.
%% Famous during his lifetime for gathering and playing
%% Shetland's traditional music, he was also well-known
%% for his own compositions in that same distinctive style.
%% This tune is with thanks to "Tommy" for "passing it on", and with
%% much love to the Heritage who are carrying it on.

%% P.S.:
%% And Valerie, thank you so much for maintaining my connection with the Heritage; I'll never forget seeing
%% you all in New Hampshire, and that wonderful jam session we all had at the Philly Festival.
%% They're still talking about that down there!
