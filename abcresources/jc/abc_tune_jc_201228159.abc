%% Just before you get to Keene,
%% there's a little tiny frog pond with a rock that sticks up out of
%% the water. Whenever Deanna and I go to the Old Songs Festival
%% over in Altamont, NY, we always see a turtle sunning itself,
%% on the rock. This has gone on for several years now, but it's
%% always the same turtle! We know this because it has a
%% funny little white mark just over one eye.
