W:As a sailor was riding along
W:In height of his glory,
W:As a sailor was riding along
W:Telling a story,
W:He met with a pretty maid by the way
W:And those very very words to her did say:
W:Pretty maid will you go along with me?
W:For I'm going down to Portsmouth.
W:
W:Kind sir, if I go along with thee,
W:I must be carried.
W:Kind sir, if I go along with thee
W:I must be married.
W:So she went along with him straightway
W:And she laid all in his arms till the day
W:And she leaved him all the reckoning to pay.
W:
W:Now in the morning when he awoke
W:He found his love a-missing,
W:Now in the morning when he awoke
W:He paid dear for his kissing.
W:O she robbed him of his gold watch and purse
W:And she took to him was ten times worse.
W:Don't you think she lay under a curse
W:In riding down to Portsmouth?
W:
W:Now landlord, what have I got to pay
W:That I may reward you?
W:Now landlord, what have I got to pay
W:That I may reward you?
W:For my horse I will leave it in pawn
W:Until from the seas I do return.
W:Such gallus, gallus girls I will shun
W:In riding down to Portsmouth
