W:She dearly lov'd a sailor
W:It was true she lov'd him well
W:And how to get to sea with him
W:She did not like why know

W:Call'd Canadee-i-o
W:
W:She bargain'd with a young sailor
W:All for a piece of gold
W:And straightway he led her
W:All down into the hold
W:Saying, 'I will dress you up in sailor's clothes
W:Your collar shall be blue
W:And you shall see that seaport town
W:Call'd Canadee-i-o

W:Now when the sailors heard of it
W:They fell into a row
W:And all the whole ship's company
W:Were willing to engage

W:Her collar will be blue
W:And she will see that seaport town
W:Call'd Canadee-i-o
W:
W:She had not been in Canada
W:Scarcely above half a year
W:She married this bold captian
W:Who call'd her his dear
W:She's dress'd in silks and satins now
W:She cuts a galliant show
W:She's the finest captain's lady
W:In Canadee-i-o
W:
W:Now come all you fair and pretty maids
W:Wherever you may be
W:I will have you follow your true love
W:When he goes out to sea
W:If the sailors they prove false to you
W:The captain he'll prove true
W:You can see the honour that I have gain'd
W:By wearing of the blue
