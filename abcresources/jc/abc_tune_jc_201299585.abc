W:
W:O she call-ed to her little page boy,
W:Who was her mo-ther's son
W:She told him as quick as he could go
W:To bring the lord safe home.
W:
W:Now the first mile he would walk,
W:And the second he would run,
W:And when he came to a broken, broken bridge
W:He would bend his breast and swim.
W:
W:When he came to the new castell,
W:The lord was sat to meat.
W:If you knew as much as me
W:How little you would eat.
W:
W:Is my bower falling, falling down,
W:Or is my tower down,
W:Or is my gay lady put to bed
W:With a daughter or a son?
W:
W:O no, your bower is not a-falling down,
W:Neither your tower down,
W:Neither is your lady put to bed
W:With a daughter or a son.
W:
W:O no, your bower is not falling down,
W:Neither is your tower down,
W:But we are afraid before you return
W:Your lady will be dead and gone.
W:
W:Come saddle, saddle my my milk-white steed,
W:Come saddle my pony too,
W:That I may neither eat nor drink
W:Till I come to the new castell.
W:
W:Now when he came to the new castell
W:He heard a big bell toll
W:And there he saw eight noble, noble men
W:A-bearing of a pall.
W:
W:Lay down, lay down that gentle, gentle corpse
W:As it lay fast asleep,
W:Lay down, lay down that gentle, gentle corpse
W:That I wish to kiss so sweet.
W:
W:Six times he kissed her red ruby lips,
W:Nine times he kissed her chin,
W:Ten times he kissed her snowy white breast
W:Which love did enter in.
W:
W:The lady was buried on that Sunday
W:Before the prayer was end,
W:And the lord he died on Sunday next
W:Before the prayer begun.

W:(Version C)
W:
W:Go fetch to me my little nephew
W:That is my sister's son,
W:That he may go and tell my Lord George
W:I shall be dead before he come.
W:
W:The messenger walked full seven long miles
W:And the other six he run
W:He ran till he came to the clear water's side
W:Then he bent on his breast and he swum.
W:
W:He swum till he came to the high castle hall
W:Where my Lord George sat at meat.
W:He said: If you knew what I'm come to tell you
W:Not a morsel more would you eat.
W:
W:Your high castle walls are all fallen down,
W:And you high castle gates are overthrown,
W:And your lady she lies on a soft bed of down,
W:She'll be dead and before you can come.
