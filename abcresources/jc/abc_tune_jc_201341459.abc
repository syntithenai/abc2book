w:Look at the glass, you will see how it's fell. I wish that you would hur-ry up and strike, strike the bell!
W:Aft on the poop there is walking about
W:Our bully second mate so able and stout,
W:What he is thinking of he doesn't know himself,
W:It seems to us he's quite forgot to strike, strike the bell!
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:Strike the bell, second mate, let us go below.
W:If you look to wind'ard you will see its goin' to blow.
W:Look at the glass, you will see how it's fell.
W:I wish that you would hurry up and strike, strike the bell!
W:
W:Aft on the maindeck working at the pumps.
W:There is the larboard watch a-longing for their bunks,
W:Lookin' to the wind'ard they see a great swell
W:They're wishing that the second mate would strike, strike the bell!
W:
W:Aft at the whell there poor Anderson stands
W:Grasping at the spokes with his cold, mittoned hands,
W:Looking at the compass, the course clear to tell,
W:He's wishing that the second mate would strike, strke the bell.
W:
W:For'ard on the fo'c'slehead keeping sharp lookout
W:There is Johnny standind, he's ready to shout.
W:"Lights burnin' bright sir! and everything is well!"
W:He's wishing that the second mate would strike, strike the bell.
W:
W:Aft on the quaterdeck our cap'n there he stands
W:Lookin' to the wind'ard with his glasses in his hands,
W:What he is thinkin' of we know very well,
W:He's thinking more of shortening sail than strike, strike the bell.
