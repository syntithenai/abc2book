W:He followed her up, he followed her down,
W:He followed her to the room where she lay.
W:She had not the power to flee from his arms,
W:Nor the tongue to answer Nay.
W:
W:She got on her little pony brown,
W:And he got on his grey.
W:They rode till they came to the broad water side,
W:The length of a long summer day.
W:
W:Get down, get down, my pretty little Miss,
W:Get down, get down, these words I say,
W:For there's nine kings' daughters I've drownded here,
W:And you the tenth shall be.
W:
W:Pull off, pull off that fine silken gown,
W:And lay it on yonders stone,
W:For it's cost your father too much money
W:To rot in the salt sea foam.
W:
W:Pull off, pull off your silken veil
W:And lay it on yonders stone,
W:For it's cost your father too much money
W:To rot in the salt sea foam.
W:
W:Turn yourself around and about,
W:Your face to the leaves of the trees,
W:For I don't think that any such a wretch,
W:A nice a-lady might see.
W:
W:He turned himself around and about,
W:His face to the leaves of the trees.
W:She gave him a plunge, she plunged him in
W:To lie in the salt water sea.
W:
W:O hand me down your soft silken hands,
W:O hand them down to me,
W:O hand me down your soft silken hands,
W:And married we will be.
W:
W:O no, O no, you false-hearted man,
W:It's lie there instead of poor me.
W:It's nine kings' daughters are drownded here,
W:And you the last shall be.
W:
W:She got on her little pony brown,
W:She led the dapple grey;
W:She rode till she came to her father's gate,
W:It were not two hours before day.
W:
W:Where have you been, my pretty little Miss?
W:Where have you been? I say.
W:Where have you been, my pretty little Miss,
W:So long before day?
W:
W:O hush, O hush, my pretty little parrot,
W:Don't tell no tales on me.
W:Your cage shall be made of yellow beaten gold
W:And hung in yonders willow tree.
