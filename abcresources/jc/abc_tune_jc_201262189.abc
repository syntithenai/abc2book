w:And the streams they are all fast bound down with frost.
W:The trees are all bare, not a leaf to be seen
W:And the meadows their beauty have lost.    
W:Now winter has come and 'tis cold for man and beast
W:And the streams they are all fast bound down with frost.
W:
W:'Twas down in the farmyard where oxen feed on straw
W:They send forth their breath like the steam.
W:Sweet Betsy the milkmaid now quickly she must go
W:For flakes of ice she finds a-floating on her cream.
W:
W:'Tis now all the small birds to the barn-door fly for food
W:And gently they rest on the spray
W:A-down the plantation the hares do search for food
W:And lift their footsteps sure for fear the do betray.
W:
W:Now Christmas is come and our song is almost done
W:For we soon shall have the turning of the year.
W:So fill up your glasses and let your health go round
W:For I wish you all a joyful New Year.
