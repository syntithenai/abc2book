%% Lots of great music and musicians come from
%% Edinburgh, Scotland, and one of these is Martyn
%% Bennett. Sarah and I stopped at the Hammond-Lee
%% (Bennett and Lorraine) House in Brookline one time
%% and that's when I had the pleasure of hearing him play. At age
%% 19 he is accomplished on piano, whistle, & pipes. Hope he likes this
%% tune!
