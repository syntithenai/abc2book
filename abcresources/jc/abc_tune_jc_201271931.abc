N: George Ramsay (1770-1838), 9th Earl of Dalhousie, served under Wellington  in
N: the  Napoleonic  Wars.   He was later appointed Lt.  Governor of Nova Scotia,
N: where he created Dalhousie University in Halifax, and later Governor  General
N: of  Canada.  In 1816, he observed in writing that the populace of Canada were
N: very poor, very  indolent,  fond  of  rum  and  that  they  generally  appear
N: half-drunk! But he was a staunch supporter of Scottish music and of Nathaniel
N: Gow in particular.  When Gow's band  played  at  the  Earl's  Ball  in  1811,
N: Dalhousie  presented  him  with  a silver goblet and a note that read "An old
N: friend of Gow's requests his acceptance of a  cup,  in  which  to  drink  the
N: health of the thousands who would wish, but cannot attend him to-night."
