%% This Dance is began by a single Person, (eithe Man or Woman) who taking a Cushion in their
%% Hand, dances about the Room, and at the End of the Tune they stop and sing, "This Dance it will
%% no farther go." The Musicians answer, "I pray, good Sir, why say you so?" Man, "Because Joan Sanderson
%% will not come too." Music. "She must come too, and she shall come too, and she must come whether
%% she will or no." Then he lays down the Cushion before a Woman, on which she kneels, and he
%% kisses her, singing,** "Prinkum prankum is a fine Dance, and shall we go dance it once again once
%% again, and once again, and shall we go dance it once again?" Then making a Stop, the Woman sings
%% as before, "This Dance &c." Music. "I pray you, Madam, &c." Woman "Because John Sanderson &c."
%% Music. "He must &c." And so she lays down the Cushion before a Man, who kneeling upon it
%% salutes her, she singing, "Welcome John Sanderson &c." Then he taking up the Cushion,
%% they take Hands and dance round, singing as before; and thus they do 'till the whole Company
%% are taken into the Ring. Then the Cushion is laid before the first Man, the Woman
%% singing, "This Dance &c." (as before) only instead of "come too", they sing "go fro"; and 
%% instead of "Welcome, John Sanderson &c." they sing "Farewell John Sanderson, farewell,
%% farewell"; and so they go out one by one as they came in. Note, the Woman is kiss'd by
%% all the Men in the Ring at her coming in and going out, and likewise the Man by all
%% the Women.
%% -- Added note: (These words comes in at this mark * Welcome Joan Sanderson, welcome welcome: then she
%% rises, takes up the Cushion and both dance, singing [illegible])
