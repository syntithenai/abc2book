W:Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu Mormond Hill,
W:And the dear land of Crimond, I bid you farewell;
W:I'm bound out for Greenland and ready to sail,
W:In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale.
W:
W:Adieu to my comrades, for a while we must part,
W:And likewise the dear lass who fair won my heart;
W:The cold ice of Greenland my love will not chill,
W:And the longer my absence, more loving she'll feel.
W:
W:Our ship is well rigged and she's ready to sail.
W:Our crew they are anxious to follow the whale;
W:Where the icebergs do float and the stormy winds blow,
W:Where the land and the ocean is covered with snow.
W:
W:The cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare,
W:No seed time nor harvest is ever known there;
W:And the birds here sing sweetly on mountain and dale,
W:But there are no sweet birds to sing to the whale.
W:
W:There's no habitation for a man to live there,
W:And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear;
W:And there'll be no temptation to tarry long there,
W:With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair.
