%
% The above is an old strain which appeared in print at least as early
% as 1798 in a much simpler setting under the name "Go to the Devil
% and Shake Yourself". It was included in six Collections of Country
% Dances published in London in that year. It has been confused with
% "Get Up Old Woman and Shake Yourself", an entirely different
% tune. None of the names appear in Bunting, Petrie or Joyce
% collections. Another name for this tune is "When You Are Sick 'Tis
% Tea You Want", but a tune so named in the Petrie Collections is a
% different 8 bar melody.
