W:As I walked out in yonder dell,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:I met a fair damsel, her name it was Nell;
W:I said, "Will you be a true lover of mine?
W:
W:"I want you to make me a cambric shirt,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:Without any seam or needlework,
W:And thcn you shall be a true lover of mine.

W:"I want you to wash it on yonder hill,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:Where dew never was nor rain never fell,
W:And then you shall be a true lover of mine.

W:"I want you to dry it on yonder thorn,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry m time;
W:Where tree never blossomed since Adam was born,
W:And then you shall be a true lover of mine."

W:"And since you have asked three questions of me,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:And now I will ask as many of thee,
W:And then I will be a true lover of thine.
W:
W:"I want you to buy me an acre of land,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:Between the salt sea and the sea sand
W:And then I will be a true lover of thine.
W:
W:"I want you to plough it with an ox's horn,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:And plant it all over with one kernel of corn,
W:And then I will be a true lover of thine.
W:
W:"I want you to hoe it with a peacock's feather,
W:Let ev'ry rose grow merry in time;
W:And thrash it all out with the sting of an adder,
W:And then I will be a true lover of thine."
