W:Oh the winter it has passed
W:and the summer's come at last,
W:the small birds are singing in the trees.
W:And their little hearts are glad,
W:ah, but mine is very sad
W:since my true love is far away from me.
W:
W:  And straight I will repair
W:  to the Curragh of Kildare
W:  for it's there I'll finds tidings of my dear
W:
W:The rose upon the briar
W:and the clouds that float so high
W:bring joy to the linnet and the bee.
W:And their little hearts are blessed,
W:but mine can know no rest
W:since my true love is far away from me.
W:
W:All you who are in love
W:aye and cannot it remove,
W:I pity the pain that you endure,
W:For experience lets me know
W:that your hearts are filled with woe,
W:it's a woe that no mortal can cure.
