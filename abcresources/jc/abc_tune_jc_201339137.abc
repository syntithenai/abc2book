W:Some rival has stolen my true love away,
W:So I in Old England no longer can stay;
W:I will swim the wide ocean all round by fair Brest, (or: all round my fair breast,)
W:To find out my true love whom I love the best.
W:
W:When I have found out my true love and delight,
W:I'll welcome her kindly by day or by night;
W:For the bells shall be a-ringing, and the drums make a noise,
W:To welcome my true love with ten thousand joys.
W:
W:Here's a health to all overs that are loyal and just;
W:Here's confusion to the rival that lives in distrust!
W:But it's I'll be as constant as a true turtle dove,
W:For I never will, at no time, prove false to my love.
