%% For many years, Pat and
%% Vicki Marron have teamed up with Pen Fix and Debra
%% Shultz in running The Lady of the Lake Dance Camp. They
%% have been great mainstays in putting on the camp, and it
%% was such a joy for me when this tune came along. All
%% the best, and many thanks to you both for all your
%% hard work and great kindness.
