%% Off the Massachusetts coast is
%% Martha's Vineyard (pro. vin...) which is where West Tisbury
%% is and also where Sandi Atwood lives. She takes the ferry
%% to the mainland twice a year, once in January to go to the
%% Ralph Page Legacy Weekend in NH and once to go to the New
%% England Folk Festival in April in MA. She blesses us with her
%% presence while she dances up a storm, and then heads back
%% to the island. It sure is nice to see you, Sandi - You're a lovely
%% West Tisbury Woman.
