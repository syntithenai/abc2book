W:It was early one morning as I was a-walking,
W:That I heard of a noble foxhunting,
W:'Twas betwixt two gentlemen and the Duke of Wellington,
W:It was early as the day was a-dawning.

W:Chorus:
W:There was Dido, Spendigo, Gently he was there-O,
W:And Traveller that never looked behind him,
W:There was Countance, Rollinance, Bonny Lass and Jovale,
W:Now these were the dogs that could find him.
W:
W:Now this fox he was young and his days were just begun,
W:Straightway he did run for his cover,
W:He ran up the highest hill and down the lowest dale,
W:Thinking to gain his life forever.
W:
W:Now poor Jack tripped o'er the plain and he tripp-ed back again,
W:And his horse and his hounds never failed him,
W:Now forever and a day old Jackie he would say,
W:Jog along my brave boys all together.
W:
W:Now this fox was getting old and his days were nearly over,
W:Straightway he did run for the river,
W:But little Dido he jumped in, and after he did swim,
W:And Traveller destroyed his life forever.
