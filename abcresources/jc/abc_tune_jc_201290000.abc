w:I'll tell you of a fel-low, of a fel-low I have seen,

w:He's nei-ther white nor yel-low, but al-to-geth-er green;

w:His name it is not charm-ing but on-ly com-mon Bill,

w:Yet he urg-es me to wed him, but I hard-ly think I will.
W:I'll tell you of a fellow, of a fellow I have seen,
W:He's neither white nor yellow, but altogether green;
W:His name it is not charming but only common Bill,
W:Yet he urges me to wed him, but I hardly think I will.
W:
W:Last night he came to see me, he made so long a stay,
W:That I really thought the blockhead would never go away;
W:He said it would be jolly as we journey up the hill
W:To go hand in hand together, but I hardly think I will.
W:
W:He talk-ed of devotion, devotion pure and deep,
W:To me it seemed so silly, I nearly fell asleep,
W:The tears the creature wasted was enough to turn a mill,
W:Yet he urges me to have him, but I hardly think I will.
W:
W:He told me of a cottage, of a cottage in the trees,
W:And don't you think this fellow fell down upon his knees?
W:He said we should be happy as we journey up the hill
W:To be always with each other, but I hardly think I will.
W:
W:You know I would not choose him, but that I'm fairly in it,
W:For he says if I refuse him he could not live a minute;
W:And there are the commandments which say you must not kill,
W:So I've thought the matter over, and I really think I will.
