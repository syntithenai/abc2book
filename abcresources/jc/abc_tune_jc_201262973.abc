W:There were two lofty ships from old England came,
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we:
W:One was the Prince of Luther and the other Prince of Wales,
W:Cruising down along the coast of the High Barbaree.
W:
W:'Aloft there, aloft!' our jolly boatswain cries.
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:'Look ahead, look astern, look the weather and a-lee,
W:Look down the coast of the High Barbaree.'
W:
W:'There's nought upon the stern, there's nought upon the lee.'
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:'But there's a lofty ship to windward and she's sailing fast and free,
W:Sailing down along the coast of High Barbaree.'
W:
W:'O hail her! O hail her!' our gallant captain cried,
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:'Are you a man-o'-war or a privateer,' said he,
W:'Cruising down along the coast of High Barbaree?'
W:
W:'O, I am not a man-o'-war nor privateer,' said he,
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:'But I'm a salt-sea pirate a-looking for my fee,
W:Cruising down along the coast of High Barbaree.
W:
W:O, 'twas broadside to broadside a long time we lay,
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:Until the Prince of Luther shot the pirate's mast away.
W:Cruising down along the coast of High Barbaree.
W:
W:'O quarter! O quarter! those pirates then did cry,
W:Blow high, blow low, and so sailed we;
W:But the quarter that we gave them we sunk them in the sea,
W:Cruising down along the coast of High Barbaree.
