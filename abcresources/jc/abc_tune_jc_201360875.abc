W:1.I'm an ordinary man, nothin' special, nothin' grand,
W:I've had to work for everything I own.
W:Well I never asked for a lot, I was happy with what I got,
W:enough to keep my family and my home.
W:Now they say that times are hard and they've handed me my cards,
W:they say there's not the work to go around.
W:When the whistle blows the gates will finally close,
W:tonight they're going to shut this factory down.
W:Then they'll tear it down.
W:
W:2.I never missed a day nor went on strike for better pay
W:for twenty years I served them best I could,
W:with a handshake and a cheque it seems so easy to forget
W:loyalty through the bad times and the good.
W:The owner says he's sad to see that things have got so bad,
W:but the Captains of Industry won't let him loose,
W:he still drives a car and smokes a cigar
W:and still he takes his family on a cruise.
W:He'll never loose.
W:
W:3.Now it seems to me to be such a cruel irony,
W:he's richer now than he ever was before,
W:Now my cheque is all spent and I can't afford the rent,
W:there's one law for the rich, one for the poor.
W:Every day I've tried to salvage some of my pride,
W:to find some work so's I might pay my way,
W:but everywhere I go the answer is always no,
W:there's no work for anyone here today.
W:No work today.
W:
W:4.And so condemned I stand just an ordinary man,
W:like thousands beside me in the queue,
W:I watch my darlin' wife tryin' to make the best of life,
W:God knows what the kids are goin' to do.
W:Now that we are faced with this human waste,
W:a generation cast aside,
W:for as long as I live I never will forgive,
W:you've stripped me of my dignity and pride.
W:You've stripped me bare.
