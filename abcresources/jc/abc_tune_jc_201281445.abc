W:Oh list, oh list to my sorrowful lay
W:And attention give to my song I pray
W:When you have heard it, you will say
W:There goes an unfortunate tailor
W:
W:Oh once I was as happy as a bird in a tree
W:My Sarah was all the world to me
W:Now I'm cut out by a son of the sea,
W:And she's left me here to bewail her
W:
W:Oh why did Sarah serve me so?
W:No more will I stitch, no more will I sew
W:My thimble and my needle to the winds I'll throw
W:And I'll go and list for a sailor
W:
W:Now my days were honey and my nights were the same
W:Till a man called Cobb from the ocean came
W:With his long black beard and his muscular frame
W:Captain on board of a whaler
W:
W:He spent his money both fast and free,
W:With his tales of the land and his songs from the sea
W:And he stole my Sarah's heart from me,
W:And he left me here to bewail her
W:
W:Oh, once I was with her when in came Cobb
W:"Avast" he cried, "You land-lubber swab!
W:If you don't knock it off, I'll scuttle your knob!"
W:And Sarah smiled at the sailor
W:
W:So now I'll cross the raging sea
W:For Sarah's proved untrue to me
W:My heart's locked up and she's the key,
W:Such a very unfeeling gaoler
W:
W:So now, kind friends, I'll bid you adieu
W:No more my woes'll trouble you
W:I'll travel the country through and through
W:And I'll go and list for a sailor
