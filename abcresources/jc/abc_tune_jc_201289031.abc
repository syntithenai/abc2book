w:Je-sus, your King is born! Je-sus is born! In ex-cel-sis glo-ri-a! *
W:'Twas in the moon of wintertime when all the birds had fled,
W:That mighty Gitchi Manitou sent angel choirs instead.
W:Before their light the stars grew dim, and wond'ring hunters heard the hymn:
W:Jesus, your King is born! Jesus is born!
W:In excelsis gloria!

W:Within a lodge of broken bark the tender Babe was found
W:A ragged robe of rabbit skin enwrapped His beauty round
W:And as the hunter braves drew nigh the angel song rang loud and high:
W:Jesus, your King is born! Jesus is born!
W:In excelsis gloria!

W:(The earliest moon of wintertime is not so round and fair
W:As was the ring of glory on the helpless infant there.
W:The chiefs from far before him
W:knelt with gifts of fox and beaver pelt.
W:Jesus your King is born, Jesus is born, in excelsis gloria.)
W:
W:Ye children of the forest free, ye sons of Manitou,
W:The Holy child of earth and heav'n is born today for you.
W:Come kneel before the radiant Boy who brings you beauty, peace and joy:
W:Jesus, your King is born! Jesus is born!
W:In excelsis gloria!
