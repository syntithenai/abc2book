W:The sun it goes down and the sky it looks read,
W:Down on yonder pillow I lay down my head,
W:I lift up my eyes to see the stars shine,
W:But still this young damsel she runs in my mind.
W:
W:When the sap it goes up the tree it will flaw,
W:We'll first branch him round, boys, and put in the saw;
W:But when we have sawed him, and tumbled him down,
W:Then we do flaw him, all on the cold ground.
W:
W:When flawing is over, haying draws near,
W:With our scythes and our pitchforks some grass for to clear;
W:But when we have mowed it and carried it away
W:We first called it green grass, we now call it hay.
W:
W:When haying is over, then harvest draws near,
W:We'll send for the brewer, to brew us strong beer;
W:To brew us strong beer for the hard working men
W:For they work late and early till harvest does end.
W:
W:When the sap it goes down the the leaves they do fall,
W:The farmer to his hedging and ditching to call,
W:But when it's hard weather there's no working there
W:Then into the barn, boys, some corn for to clear.
W:
W:When Spring it comes on, the maid to her cow,
W:The boy to his whip, and the man to his plough,
W:And so we bring all things so cheerfully round,
W:Success to the ploughman that ploughs up the ground.
