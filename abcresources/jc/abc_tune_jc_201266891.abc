Jonas.19-11-2007, 05:12 PMI can't believe that no one came up with the resquest for 7 nation army from the white stripes, I tried to do it myself, but it's pretty hard, so I gave up
even though if it ever pops up, I'd be very happy!

Laurelinde04-12-2007, 10:44 PMPossibly a slightly obscure request, but I would love to be able to play 'I'm A-doun for Lack O'Johnnie' - it's a Scottish folk song and it's very beautiful, and I think it would fit well in the game. Whenever I hear the version that Vanessa Mae does it makes me think of bards and minstrels!
Anyway if anyone could help me with doing some kind of notation for this (I'm a complete novice) I'd be very grateful. :)
I'm sure I'll have more requests later... ;)

achazia11-12-2007, 05:57 AMThis is my first post here, and also one of my first attempt to make a song in midi->abc
I saw Beowulf yesterday, and I liked the songs: Gently how she goes and A Hero Comes Home. I think it fits in the Lotro game. it's a simple/short melodies. It sounds best, if both instruments are synced together
Gently how she goes:
