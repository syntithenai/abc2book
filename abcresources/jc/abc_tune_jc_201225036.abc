%% I get to see Moe Turotte once a
%% year when I go to Augusta for Irish Week and take Billy
%% McComiskey's Button Box class. Moe is a regular down
%% there and it's alays a pleasure when we have our
%% annual meeting. He has a T-shirt that gave me the
%% title of this tune; I sure hope it plays OK on your box, Moe.
