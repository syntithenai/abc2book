W:The Anti-Gallican's safe arriv'd,
W:On board of her with speed we'll hie;
W:She'll soon be fit to sail away -
W:To the Anti-gallican haste away.
W:(Chorus) Haste away, haste away,
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
W:
W:For gold, we'll sail the ocean o'er,
W:From Briton's isle to the French shore;
W:No ships from us shall run away -
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
W:
W:Those Spaniards, too, - those cunning knaves,
W:We'll take their ships and make them slaves;
W:Till war's declared we'll never stay -
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
W:
W:Our country calls us all to arms,
W:To keep us safe from French alarms;
W:Then let us all her voice obey -
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
W:
W:When we are rich, then home we'll steer,
W:And enter Shields with many a cheer,
W:To meet our friends so blythe and gay -
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
W:
W:To Charlotte's Head, then let's repair,
W:We'll be received with welcome there;
W:We'll enter, then, without delay -
W:To the Anti-Gallican haste away.
