w:And they will do their best, And the best can do no more.
W:You noble spectators, wherever you be,
W:Your attention I beg and I crave;
W:For all my desire is to make us large room,
W:And abundance of pastimes we'll have.
W:
W:I am the second Samson, in Judges you'll find,
W:Who delights in his darling so dear;
W:What a blockhead I was for to tell her my mind,
W:And so gallant and quick you shall hear.
W:
W:The first that comes on like a ranting young lad -
W:He conquers wherever he goes;
W:He's scorned by his enemies to be controlled,
W:And his name it is King William Raw.
W:
W:The next is his brother, you might think they were twins,
W:I thought by the world they would fight;
W:When these two Philistians siez-ed on me,
W:You'd ha' thought they had ruined me quite.
W:
W:The third is a man of some more milder blood,
W:Some pity there's lodged in his breast;
W:He oftentimes threatened to do me some good,
W:But he doesn't for fear of the rest.
W:
W:The fourt' he comes on like a ranting young lad,
W:He's like some great gestical stand;
W:It was he that gave orders that I should be polled,
W:So they fettered my feet and my hands.
W:
W:The fift' is a cruel as cruel can be,
W:The others and him did revise
W:It was he that gave orders I should no more see,
W:So they instantly bored out my eyes.
W:
W:The sixt' is no better than all of the rest,
W:He was the first breeder of strife,
W:If any of  you then had been in my place,
W:You'd ha' been glad to com'd off with your life.
W:
W:These are the six lords that first ruined me,
W:Without the consent of my dear;
W:But I will come even with them by-and-bye
W:So gallant and quick you shall hear.
W:
W:When they were all merry carousing with wine,
W:When first down for Samson did call;
W:He pulled down the house, slew them all at that time,
W:So there was an end of 'em all.

W:(Prologue to dance:)
W:These are six actors bold,
W:Never came on stage before;
W:And they will do their best,
W:And the best can do no more.
W:
W:You'd seen them all go round.
W:Think on 'em what you will;
W:Music strike up and play
W:"T' aud lass fra Dallowgill."
