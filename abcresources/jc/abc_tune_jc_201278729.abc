W:His wings as drifted snow, his eyes as flame,
W:All hail", said He, "Thou lowly maiden Mary,

W:"For known a blessed Mother thou shalt be,
W:All generations laud and honour thee,
W:Thy Son shall be Emmanuel, by seers foretold.
W:Most highly favour'd lady," Gloria!

W:Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head,
W:"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,
W:"My soul shall laud and magnify His Holy Name."
W:Most highly favour'd lady, Gloria!
W:
W:Of her, Emmanuel, the Christ, was born
W:In Bethlehem, all on a Christmas morn,
W:And Christian folk throughout the world will ever say -
W:Most highly favour'd lady, Gloria!
