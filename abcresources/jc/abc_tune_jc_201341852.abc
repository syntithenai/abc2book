after you've pasted it go on 'file -> save as' type in a file name you remember and change the 'save as type' to 'all files'. then save it in the music folder of lord of the rings online.
go onto your character type /music then type /play (file name) e.g /play Mario

Ganoderma04-01-2008, 07:49 PMwhat most people dont know:
when you are playing a song, and walk it gives this annoying error, 'you must be in music mode to play a song' after every line in your chatbox. (not always, its random somehow)
press ` (next to the 1) to stop playing a song while in music mode. this way you wont get this error.
