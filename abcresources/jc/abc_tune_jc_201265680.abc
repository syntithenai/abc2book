% Soon shall I see thy bright shores in the sunlight
% The heather of hills and the rising of morn
% The rolling grey sea mist rolls east in the morning
% To run the wild hills of the cuillins of Rhum
% 
% Far away seaward thy green hills are lovelit
% Where runs the hill water afoam to the sea
% Like tangle at noontime, like snow wreath in moonlight
% As thou who art yearning will yearn it to be
% 
% Far away seaward my queenland, my youthland
% Far away seaward the cuillins of home
% And here in my dream time I'm hearing hill water
% The laughter of streams by the cuillins of Rhum
% 
% Soon shall I see thy bright shores in the sunlight
% The heather of hills and the rising of morn
% The rolling grey sea mist rolls east in the morning
% To run the wild hills o' the cuillins of Rhum
