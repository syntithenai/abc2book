w:By chance it was I met my love, It did me much sur-prise, Down by a sha-dy myr-tle grove, Just as the sun did rise. The_ birds they sang right glo-rious-ly, And plea-sant was the air;_ And there was none, save she and I, A-mong the flow-ers fair.
W:By chance it was I met my love,
W:It did me much surprise,
W:Down by a shady myrtle grove,
W:Just as the sun did rise.
W:The birds they sang right gloriously,
W:And pleasant was the air;
W:And there was none, save she and I,
W:Among the flowers fair.
W:
W:In dewy grass and green we walk'd,
W:She was timid and was coy;
W:"How can'st thou choose but pity me,
W:My pretty pearl, my joy?
W:How comes it that thou stroll'st this way?
W:Sweet Maiden, tell me true,
W:Before bright Pheobus' glittering ray
W:Has supped the morning dew?"
W:
W:"I go to tend the flocks I love
W:The ewes and tender lambs,
W:That pasture by the myrtle grove,
W:That gambol by thier dams;
W:There I enjoy a pure content
W:At dawning of the day,"
W:Then, hand in hand, we lovers went
W:To see the flock at play.
W:
W:And as whe wended down the road.
W:I said to her, "Sweet maid,
W:Three years I in my place abode
W:And three more must be stayed.
W:Three times that I am bound so fast,
W:O fairest wait for me.
W:And when these weary years are passed
W:Then married we will be"
W:
W:Three years are long, three times to long,
W:Too lengthy the delay".
W:O then I answered in my song,
W:"Hope wastes them quick away.
W:Where love is fervent, fain and fast,
W:And knoweth not decay.
W:There nimbly fleet the seasons past
W:Accounted as one day."
