W:From this valley they say you are going;

W:Chorus:
W:Come and sit by my side if you love me,
W:Do not hasten to bid me adieu,
W:But remember the Red River Valley
W:And the girl who has loved you so true.
W:
W:For this long, long time I have waited
W:For the words that you never would say,
W:But now my last hope has vanished
W:When they tell me that you're going away.
W:
W:Oh, there never could be such a longing
W:In the heart of a white maiden's breast
W:As there is in the heart that is breaking
W:With love for the boy who came west.
W:
W:When you go to your home by the ocean
W:May you never forget the sweet hours
W:That we spent in the Red River Valley,
W:Or the vows we exchanged 'mid the bowers.
W:
W:Will you think of the valley you're leaving?
W:Oh, how lonely and dreary 'twill be!
W:Will you think of the fond heart you're breaking
W:And be true to your promise to me?
W:
W:The dark maiden's prayer for her lover
W:To the spirit that rules o'er the world;
W:His pathway with sunshine may cover,
W:Leave his grief to the Red River girl.
