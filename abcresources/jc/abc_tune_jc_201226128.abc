%% Jack Sloanaker
%% lives down in Lincoln, MA, and besides being the producer
%% of the Canterbury Orchestra "blue record" and several others,
%% he also played on it, too. I guess you could say he was "_instrumental_
%% in its production"! - I hope this tune will fit OK into your
%% fife and drum activities, Jack - Best wishes always to you!
