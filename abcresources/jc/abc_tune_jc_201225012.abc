%% The day before we were scheduled to play
%% a dance at the '92 Folklife Festival in Seattle, Frank Blade threw
%% his back out, and he was in real serious pain. You know what?
%% The next day he showed up a half hour before starting time, and
%% played the whole set perfectly; you'ld never have known there
%% was anything bothering him! I mean not even a litle bit. You
%% sure earned the gold medal for courage that time, Frank. We
%% couldn't have done it without you!
