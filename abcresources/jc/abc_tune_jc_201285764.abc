%: There were three brothers in Merry Scotland, In Merry Scotland there were three,
%: And they did cast lots which of them should go, should go, should go,
%: And turn robber all on the salt sea.
%:
W: The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin: The youngest of all the three,
W: That he should turn robber all on the salt sea, the salt sea, the salt sea,
W: For to maintain his two brothers and he.
W:
W: They had not been sailing for but a long winter's night, And part of the short winter's day,
W: When he espied a stout lofty ship, lofty ship, lofty ship,
W: Come and bearing down on him straight way.
W:
W: "Hello, hello," cried Henry Martin, "What makes you sail so nigh?"
W: "I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London town, London town, London town,
W: Would you please for to let me pass by?"
W:
W: "Oh no, oh no," cried Henry Martin, "This thing could never be,
W: for I have turned robber all on the salt sea, the salt sea, the salt sea,
W: For to maintain my two borthers and me."
W:
W: "Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizzen, Bring your ship under my lee
W: Or I will give you a full cannon ball, cannon ball, cannon ball,
W: And all you dead bodies drown in the salt sea."
W:
W: "Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail, Nor bring our ship under your lee
W: And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods, merchant goods, merchant goods,
W: Nor point our bold guns to the sea."
W:
W: And broadside and broadside and at it they went For fully two hours or three,
W: Till Henry Martin gave to them the death shot, death shot, death shot,
W: And straight to the bottom went she."
W:
W: Bad news, bad news to old England came, Bad news to fair London town,
W: There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away, cast away, cast away,
W: And all of her merry men drowned.
