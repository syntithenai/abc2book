W:Tobacco is an Indian weed,
W:Grows green at morn, is cut down at eve;
W:It shows our decay;
W:We fade as hay.
W:Think on this,-when you smoke tobacco.
W:
W:The pipe that is so lily-white,
W:Wherein so many take delight,
W:Gone with a touch;
W:Man's life is such,
W:Think on this,- when you smoke tobacco.
W:
W:The pipe that is so foul within,
W:Shews how the soul is stained with sin;
W:It doth require
W:The purging fire.
W:Think on this,-when you smoke tobacco.
W:
W:The ashes that are left behind,
W:Do serve to put us all in mind,
W:That unto dust,
W:Return we must.
W:Think on this,-when you smoke tobacco.
W:
W:The smoke that doth so high ascend,
W:Shows that our life must have an end;
W:The vapours' gone,
W:Man's life is done.
W:Think on this,-when you smoke tobacco.
