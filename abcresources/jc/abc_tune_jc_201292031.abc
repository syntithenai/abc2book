W:A great crowd had gathered, outside of Kilmainham,
W:Their heads all uncovered, they knelt to the ground.
W:For inside that grim prison, lay a brave Irish soldier,
W:His life for his country about to lay down.
W:
W:He went to his death like a true son of Ireland,
W:The firing party he bravely did face.
W:Then the order rang out, present arms and fire,
W:James Connolly fell into a ready made grave.
W:
W:The black flag was hoisted, the cruel deed was over.
W:Gone was a man who loved Ireland so well,
W:There was many a sad heart, in Dublin that morning,
W:When they murdered James Connelly, the Irish rebel
W:
W:Many years have gone by since that Irish rebellion,
W:When the guns of Brittania, they loudly did speak,
W:And the bold I.R.A. they stood shoulder to shoulder,
W:As the blood from thier bodies flowed down Sackville street
W:
W:The four courts of Dublin, the English bombarded,
W:The spirit they tried hard to quell,
W:But above all the dim came the cry no surender,
W:Was the voice of James Connelly, the Irish rebel.
