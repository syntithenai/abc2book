w:Thought my love the song en-thrall-ing. La, la, la, la, la,_ la, la, la, la, la.
W:Heard my love a wild bird calling,
W:(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.)
W:Tree-top high the notes were falling,
W:(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.)
W:Bright and sweet that woodland serenade,
W:(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.)
W:Thought my love the song enthralling.
W:(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.)
W:
W:Took my flute into the meadow,
W:By the path my love would follow,
W:Climbed a branch my song to play upon,
W:Birdsong wild I'd overshadow.
W:
W:Moonrise saw my loved one coming,
W:Proudly now my heart was drumming,
W:Bard of Eve I played my masquerade
W:Golden notes my flute was humming.
W:
W:Cried my love with all her power
W:"Vixen-voiced are ghosts of Gower!"
W:Turned and ran and left me woebegone,
W:Crushed as trodden woodland flower.
