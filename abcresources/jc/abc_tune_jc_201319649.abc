W:An old man he courted me, fal the dol doodle,
W:An old man he courted me, hi derry down;
W:An old man he courted me all for to marry me;
W:Maids when you're young never wed an old man.

W:So maids while you're young never wed an old man.

W:It's when that we went to church, fal the dol doodle,
W:It's then that we went to church, hi derry down,
W:It's when that we went to church he left me in the lurch;
W:Maids while you're young never wed an old man.

W:It's when we were coming home, fal the dol doodle,
W:Oh, when we were coming home, hi derry down,
W:It's when we were coming home he let me walk alone;
W:Maids while you're young never wed an old man.

W:When at supper set, hey derry down,
W:It's when at supper set devil a bite he could eat;
W:Maids when you're young never wed an old man.
W:
W:Oh, it's when that we went to bed, fal the dol doodle,
W:It's when that we went to bed, hi derry down,
W:It's when that we went to bed, he lay as if he was dead;
W:Maids when you're young never wed an old man.
W:
W:I threw me leg over him, fal the dol doodle,
W:I threw me leg over him, hi derry down,
W:I threw me leg over him, I swore I would smother him;
W:Maids when you're young never wed an old man.
W:
W:Oh, it's when he fell fast aslep, fal the dol doodle,
W:Oh, when he fell fast asleep, hi derry down,
W:It's when he fell fast asleep, out of bed I did creep,
W:And into the arms of a sporting young man.
W:
W:Oh, there we did sport and play, fal the dol doodle,
W:Oh, there we did sport and play, hi derry down,
W:It's there we did sport and play until the break of day;
W:Then I crept back to my lazy old man.
