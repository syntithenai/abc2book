%% With love and best
%% wishes always to Mr. & Mrs. Peter Orzechowski of
%% Claremont, N.H. Mrs. is Janie O., who is the fiddler
%% for the group "Greengate", with Sarah Bauhan and Dave
%% Surette. They make great music, and sometimes I get
%% to play with them when they ask me. I think that's
%% pretty nice of them, don't
%% you? Peter's not doing so 
%% bad this year, either - he's
%% made a lot of pocket money
%% baby sitting the kids!
%% (__Thanks__, __Pete__!)
