Composed in honour for an enthusiastic young group of Scottish Country dancers who were led by  Rita
Grzmyl. I used to play for them at many of the demonstrations they performed for in Gleneagles Hotel
and I and the band had the great pleasure of playing for them when they danced for the  Commonwealth
Prime Ministerâ€™s Conference held in Gleneagles Hotel in 1978.
