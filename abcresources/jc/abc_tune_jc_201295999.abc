W:A fair young May went up the street,
W:Some white fish for to buy,
W:And a bonny clerk's fa'n in luve wi' her,
W:An' he's followed her by and by.
W:
W:"O! where live ye, my bonny lass,
W:I pray thee tell to me,
W:For gin the night were ever sae mirk,
W:I wad come and visit thee."
W:
W:"O ! my faither he aye locks the door,
W:My mither keeps the key,
W:And gin ye were ever sic a wily wicht,
W:Ye canna win in to me."
W:
W:But the clerk he had ae true brother,
W:And a wily wicht was lie,
W:And lie has made a lang ladder,
W:Was thirty steps and three.
W:
W:He has made a cleek but and a creel?
W:A creel but and a pin ;
W:And he's away to the chimley-top,
W:And he's letten the bonny clerk in.
W:
W:The auld wife being not asleep,
W:Tho' late, late was the hour?
W:"I?ll lay my life," quo' the silly auld wife,
W:"There's a man in our dochter's bower."
W:
W:The auld man lie gat owre the bed,
W:To see if the thing was true,
W:But she's ta'en the bonny clerk in her arms,
W:And covered him owre wi' blue.
W:
W:"O ! where are ye gaun now, father?" she says,
W:"And where are ye gaun se late?
W:Ye've disturb?d me at my evening prayers,
W:And, O, but they were sweet."
W:
W:"O ! ill betide ye, silly auld wife,
W:And an ill death may ye dee ;
W:She has the muckle bulk in her airms
W:And she's prain' for yon and me."
W:
W:The auld wife still lay wide awake,
W:Then something mair was said,
W:"I'll lay my life," quo' the silly auld wife,
W:"There's a man by our dochter's bed."
W:
W:The auld wife now gat owre the bed,
W:To see if the thing was true,
W:But what the wrack took the auld wife's fit!
W:For into the creel she flew.
W:
W:The man that was at the chimley-top,
W:Finding the creel was fu',
W:He wrappit the rape round his left shouther,
W:And fast to him lie drew.
W:
W:"O help! O help! O hinny now, help!
W:O help! O hinny, do!
W:For him that ye aye wished me at,
W:He's carryin' me off just noo'."
W:
W:"O! if the foul thief's gotten' ye,
W:I wish he may keep his haud ;
W:For a' the lee lang winter nicht
W:Ye'll never lie in your bed."
W:
W:He's towed her up, lie's towed her down,
W:He's gien her a richt down fa',
W:Till every rib o' the auld wife's side,
W:Played nick nack on the wa'.
W:
W:O! the blue, the bonny, bonny blue,
W:And I wish the blue may do weel ;
W:And every auld wife that's sae jealous o' her dochter
W:May she got a good keach i' the creel.
