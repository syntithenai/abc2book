W: When liberty is put to sale   For wine, for money, or for ale;
W: The seller's must be abject slaves,   The buyers vile designing knaves,
W: And it has a proverb been of old,   The devil's bought but to be sold.
W: 
W: This maxim in the statesman's school   Is always taught, divide and rule,
W: All parties are to him a joke,   While zealots foam he fits the yoke;
W: When men their reason once resume,   'Tis then the statesman's turn to fume.
W: 
W: Learn, learn, ye Briton's to unite,   Leave off the old exploded bite;
W: Henceforth let Whig and Tory cease,   And turn all party-rage to peace;
W: Then shall we see a glorious thing,   And so, God bless great George our King.
