%% Banjo player Ray MacIntire has been
%% a part of the New England music scene as far back as I can recall.
%% I can't think of a New England Folk Festival he hasn't been at, and
%% that goes back a long way. He and his lovely wife, Lois, have
%% been awfully nice to me over the years, even to the extent of
%% providing B and B on occasions when I was at Neffa and had no housing.
%% I sure do thank you, folks!
