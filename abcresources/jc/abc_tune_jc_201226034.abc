%% It was so nice to get to know James
%% Noonan from Francestown (and New Jersey!) when he became a student
%% at Conval High School and joined the weight-lifting group I coach
%% there. He's a great boy, and now he's married to Nicki, has a cute little
%% daughter named Ashley, goes to the University of West Virginia in
%% Morgantown, plays on the hockey team, and hist a 4.0 grade point
%% average. Pretty good, huh? I think so!
%% Love ya, kid --
