N: I've tried to be as faithful to the book's notation as ABC and modern music software allows.
N: In some cases, repeat signs don't match modern practice, and have been "modernized".
N: In a few cases, it's not clear what was intended, and no modernizing was done;
N: this may confuse some software (and musicians).
N: Sometimes dots are missing (or added); they have been fixed to agree with other bars in the song.
N: Numbers have been added to verses below the staff, since some ABC software formats such lyrics
N: in ways that may not make the order of the verses obvious.

W:5.But, whisht, nae mair o' this we'll speak,
W:  For yonder Jamie does us meet;
W:  Instead o' Meg he kiss'd sae sweet,
W:    I trow he likes the gawkie.
W:  "O dear Bess, I hardly knew,
W:  "When I came by your gown sae new;
W:  "I think you've got it wet wi' dew."
W:    Quoth she, 'That's like a gawkie;

W:  'And I'll get gowns when it is gane;
W:  'Sae ye may gang the gate ye came,
W:    'And tell it to your dawtie.'
W:  The guilt appeared in Jamie's cheek;
W:  He cry'd, "O cruel maid, but sweet,
W:  "If I should gang anither gate,
W:    "I ne'er could meet my dawtie."
W:
W:7.The lasses fast frae him they flew,
W:  And left poor Jamie sair to rue,
W:  That ever Maggie's face he knew,
W:    Or yet ca'd Bess a gawkie.
W:  As they gade owre the muir they sang,
W:  The hills and dales with echo rang,
W:  The hills and dales with echo rang,

W:    The Castle o' Montgomery,

W:
W:3.Wi' mony a vow, and lock'd embrace,
W:    Our parting was fu' tender;
W:  And pledging aft to meet again,
W:    We tore ourselves asunder.
W:  But oh! fell death's untimely frost,
W:    That nipt my flow'r so early;
W:  Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay.
W:    That wraps my Highland Mary!
W:

W:    I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly!
W:  And clos'd for ay, the sparkling glance
W:    That dwelt on me sae kindly!
W:  And mould'ring now, in silent dust,
W:    That heart that lo'ed me dearly;
W:  But still within my bosom's core,
W:    Shall live my Highland Mary.

N: This song has a lot of rhythm errors, some perhaps due to poor printing.
N: Added bar line after first note to correct the rhythm;
N: Fixed bar 2's missing 8th note to match other bars.
N: Bar 7 has an odd dot after/below the b; not transcribed.
N: Both strains have incorrect rhythm in their last measures; fixed by lengthening the last notes.
N: Also changed initial G pickup to 1/8 note, since no other bars have 1/16-note pickups.
N: Bar 11 has an extra 1/8 length; corrected by shortening the a note.
N: Bar 12 has an extra 1/8 length; shortened the "-rits" syllable to fix it.
