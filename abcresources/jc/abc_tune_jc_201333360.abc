w:To see my ba-by there.
w:She's ver-y low!" he said,
w:On~the cor-ner by the square
w:His eyes_ blood-shot red.
w:Wher-e-ver she may be.
w:In~my high-top Stet-son hat.
w:Six chorus~girls to sing my song.
w:Let's have another round of booze.

w:She was ly-in' on a long white ta-ble,
w:Went_ back_ to_ see my ba-by,
w:They were ser-vin' the_ drinks as us-ual,
w:He_ turned_ to the crowd a-round him,
w:She may search_ this_ wide world o-ver.
w:Put a gold_ piece_ on my watch chain,
w:Put a jazz_ band_ on my tail gate,
w:And_ if_ a-ny-one should ask you, just tell them,

w:So_ sweet, so_ cool,_ so fair.
w:Great_ God! She was ly-in' there dead.
w:And the us-ual_ crowd_ was there.
w:These_ are the_ words_ he said:
w:She'-ll never find a man_ like me.
w:So they'll know I_ died_ standin' pat.
w:To raise Hell as we go_ a-long.
w:I've~got the Saint James In-fir-ma-ry Blues.
