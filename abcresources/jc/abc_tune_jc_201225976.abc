%% You've already met Lydia Reeve.
%% She has a jig, back in Book 8, but I just coldn't leave it at that, not
%% with Lydia! She just had to have her own waltz, too, and when this one showed
%% up recently, I said, "_WOW_"!! That's _Lydia_'s Waltz! So here it is, dear lady,
%% with much love to you from Bob--
