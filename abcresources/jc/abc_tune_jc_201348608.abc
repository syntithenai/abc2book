W:It's of a brisk young lively lad
W:Came out of Gloucestershire,
W:And all his full intention was
W:To court a lady fair.
W:Her eyes they shone like morning dew,
W:Her hair was fair to see;
W:She was grace
W:In form and face,
W:And was fixed in modesty.
W:
W:This couple was a-walking,
W:They loved each other well;
W:And someone heard them talking
W:And did her father tell.
W:And when her father came to know
W:And understand this thing,
W:Then said he
W:"From one like thee
W:I'll free my daughter in the spring!"
W:
W:'Twas in the spring-time of the year
W:There was a press begun;
W:And all their full intention was
W:To press a farmer's son.
W:They press-ed him, and sent him out
W:Far o'er the raging sea.
W:"Where I'm sure
W:He will no more
W:Keep my daughter company!"
W:
W:In man's apparel then she did
W:Resolve to try her fate;
W:And in the good ship where he rid
W:She went as surgeon's mate.
W:Says she "My soldier shall not be
W:Destroyed for want of care;
W:I will dress,
W:And I will bless,
W:Whatsoever I endure!"
W:
W:The twenty-first of August
W:There was a fight begun,
W:And foremost in the battle
W:They placed the farmer's son.
W:He there received a dreadful wound
W:That struck him in the thigh,
W:Every vein
W:Was filled with pain
W:He got wounded dreadfully.
W:
W:Into the sergeon's cabin
W:They did convey him straight,
W:Where, first of all the wounded men,
W:The pretty surgeon's mate
W:Most tenderly did dress his wound
W:Which bitterly did smart;
W:Then said he
W:"Oh! one like thee
W:Once was mistress of my heart!"
W:
W:She went to the commander
W:And offered very fair:
W:"Forty of fifty guineas
W:Shall buy my love quite clear!
W:No money shall be wanted,
W:No londer tarry here!"
W:"Since 'tis so
W:Come, let's go!
W:To old England we will steer!"
W:
W:She went unto he father's gate
W:And stood there for a while;
W:Said he "The heavens bless you!
W:My own and lovely child!"
W:Cried she "Since I have found him,
W:And brought him safe to shore,
W:Our days we'll spend
W:In old England,
W:Never roam abroad no more!"
