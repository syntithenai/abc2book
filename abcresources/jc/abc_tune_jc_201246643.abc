w:mong the new-mown hay.
W:As I walked out one morn betime,
W:To view the fields in May, Sir,
W:There I espied a fair sweet maid,
W:Among the new-mown hay, Sir.
W:Among the new-mown hay.
W:
W:I said: 'Good morning, pretty maid,
W:How come you here so soon, say?'
W:'To keep my father's sheep,' she said
W:'A thing that must be done, aye!
W:Among the new-mown hay.
W:
W:'While they be feeding mid the dew,
W:To pass the time away, Sir!
W:I sit me down to knit and sew,
W:Among the new-mown hay, Sir!
W:Among the new-mown hay.'
W:
W:I asked if she would wed with me,
W:All on that sunny day, Sir!
W:The answer that she gave to me
W:Was surely not a nay, Sir!
W:Among the new-mown hay.
W:
W:Then to the church we sped with speed
W:And Hymen join'd our hands, Sir!
W:No more the ewes and lambs she'll feed
W:Since she did make her answer,
W:Among the new-mown hay.
W:
W:A lord I be, a lady she,
W:To town we sped straightway, Sir!
W:To bless the day, we both agree,
W:We met among the hay, Sir!
W:Among the new-mown hay.
