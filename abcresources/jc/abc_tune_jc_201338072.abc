w: 1.~Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep, O-cean's a roy-al bed.
w:~~~~Rocked in the deep, Flo-ra will keep        Watch by your wear-y head.
w: 2.~Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,   Thun-der-claps rend the air;
w:   ~Baf-fled, our foes stand by the shore,      Fol-low they will not dare.
w: 3.~Ma-ny's the lad fought on that day,         Well the clay-more could wield,
w:   ~When the night came, si-lent-ly lay         Dead on Cul-lo-den's field.
w: 4.~Burned are their homes, ex-ile and death    Scat-ter the loy-al men;
w:   ~Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath        Char-lie will come a-gain.
