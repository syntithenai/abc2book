W:(Chorus)
W:Here's adieu to Old England adieu, and adieu to some hundreds of pounds -
W:if the world had been ended before I was born my troubles I never should know.
W:
W:Once I could eat of the best, the bestest of the brown bread,
W:but now I am glad for the hard mouldy crust and glad  I could get it to eat.
W:
W:Once I could drink of the best, the bestest of ale so brown,
W:but now I am glad of a cup of spring water that runneth from town to town.
W:
W:Oh once I could lie on my bed; my bed was the softest of down,
W:but now I am glad of a lock of chair straw to keep me up from the cold ground.
