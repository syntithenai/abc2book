%% It's not clear how much is to be repeated (with 2 endings).
%% Maybe those are just two endings for the 16-bar tune.
%% O'Neill's DMoI collection has :| instead of || in the middle of the 2nd staff,
%% for two 8-bar phrases with the first repeated, which is still ambiguous.
%% The tune works as a 16- or 32-bar tune, so play it however you like.
