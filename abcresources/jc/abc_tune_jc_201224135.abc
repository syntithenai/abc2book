%% Donna Long plays piano
%% for the Irish contingent at Augusta. Her young son, who has taken up the
%% fiddle, asked me one day how I named my tunes. I said I named them
%% after peole, places, or things that for one reason or another became
%% dear to me. After a short pause, he suddenly stuck out his hand
%% and said brightly, "_My_ name is Jesse Smith!" Behold the result.
