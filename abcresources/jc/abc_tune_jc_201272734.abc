O:Barry, JAF, XVIII (1905), p.213; text, pp. 50-51.  Sung by
O:Mrs S.A. Flint, Providence, R.I., 1904.
H:According to Barry (p. 213), Mrs Flint learned this song from
a man born about 1800.  The tune seems to shift from an anchorage
on G to one on F, after the mid cadence; that is, from Dorian to
F major.  Something has probably gone amiss.  Cf Joyce's tune
immediately following.

W:I pray you would grant me the same liberty.
W:
W:I want you to buy me an acre of land
W:Between the salt water and the sea sand.
W:
W:Go plough it all up with one cuckold's horn
W:Go sow it all down with one pepper corn.

W:Go reap it all up with a sickle of leather
W:And bind it all up with one cock's feather.
