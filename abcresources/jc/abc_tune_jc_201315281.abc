W: 'Twas upon the green valley and down the green grove
W:Like one that was troubled in mind,
W:She whooped and she halloed and she played upon her pipe,
W:But no bonnie boy could she find,
W:But no bonnie boy could she find.

W:She look-ed up high and she look-ed down low,
W:The sun did shine wonderful warm;
W:Whom should she spy there but her bonnie, bonnie boy,
W:So close in another girl's arms,
W:So close in another girl's arm.

W:"I pass-ed him by, on him ne'er cast an eye,
W:Though he strectched forth his lily-white hand,
W:For I thought he'd be bound to love but one,
W:So I would not obey his command,
W:So I would not obey his command.

W:"The girl that was loved of my little bonnie boy,
W:I am sure she is greatly to blame,
W:For many's the night he has robbed me of my rest,
W:But he never shall do it again,
W:But he never shall do it again.

W:"My bonnie, bonnie boy is gone over the sea,
W:I fear I shan't she him again;
W:But were I to have him. or were I to not,
W:I will think of him once now and then,
W:I will think of him once now and then."
