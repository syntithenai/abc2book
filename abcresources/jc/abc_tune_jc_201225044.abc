%% East Alstead, NH, is an interesting
%% place. hey have a cat over there who thinks he's a piano player.
%% There's a real good fiddler in the town; and then there's a guy
%% who is just a celebrated block-print wood carver (but now I've got
%% to tell you, they're the same guy, Randy Miller!) And then, too, there's
%% Randy's wife, Kathy, who calls dances and works a lot with kids
%% and she's so nice to me whenever I see her that, well, You're looking
%% at it right now!  Love you lots, Kathy!
