W:Last New Year's Day I heard them say,
W:Young Dicky mounted Dobbin grey.
W:Away he rode to Taunton Dean
W:To court the parson's daughter Jane.
W:(Sing fal the dal did-dle O i-gee O,    
W:Sing fal the dal did-dle O i-gee O.)
W:
W:His buckskin breeches he put on,
W:His Sunday clothes so neatly shone,
W:The hat he wore upon his head
W:Was neatly trimmed with ribbons red.
W:
W:Away he rode all in great sweat
W:Until he came to the parson's gate,
W:And there he cried: Hullo, hullo,
W:What! are the good people at home or no?
W:
W:O the trusty servant let him in
W:And then the courtship did begin.
W:Straightway he went into the hall
W:And aloud for Parson's Jane did call.
W:
W:Miss Jane walked down all in great sway
W:To hear what Dicky had got to say.
W:I am a good fellow although I am poor,
W:I never did fall in love before.
W:
W:If I consent to be your bride,
W:What will you for me provide?
W:For I can neither card nor spin
W:Nor neither help your harvest in.
W:
W:Sometime I reap, I plough, I sow,
W:And sometimes I to the market go.
W:The old mare's keep be corn and hay
W:And she earn me sixpence every day.
W:
W:Sixpence a day that will not do
W:To gird me in silks and satins too,
W:Besides the coach when I take the air.
W:The devil, says Dicky, you make me stare.
W:
W:Sixpence a day that won't find meat,
W:Nor faith, say Dick, nor sacks of wheat,
W:But if you'll consent to marry me now
W:I'll make you as fat as father's old cow.
W:
W:His complements were so polite
W:Which made the good people laugh outright.
W:And when young Dick hd no more to say
W:He mounted Dobbin and rode away.
