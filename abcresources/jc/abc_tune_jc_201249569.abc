W:Now it's of a youth and a well-bred youth
W:And he being a squire's only son,
W:He fell in love with a bailiff's daughter
W:When she lived near Waterford town.
W:
W:But when his parents the truth came to know
W:How foolishly inclined,
W:They bound him apprentice for Clemensford town
W:And they told him his business to mind.
W:
W:For to stick to his books and to study the law
W:And to leave his true love behind.
W:Alas and adieu shall I never see her more,
W:For she still runs in my mind.
W:
W:Now it happened to be in the summer time
W:In the merry month of May,
W:When she set herself down on a bank that was green
W:And her true love came riding that way.
W:
W:Now he stepp-ed up to this pretty fair maid,
W:"One word, one word", he did say,
W:"one word, one word, kind miss", he did say
W:"For to ease a poor troubled mind."
W:
W:"O it's where was you bred and where was you born?"
W:"Near Waterford town", she did say,
W:"Near Waterford town, kind sir", she did say,
W:"Where I've suffered for many's the day".
W:
W:"Then if you've been born near Waterford town,
W:Then it's surely the truth you must know,
W:Of the bailiff's daughter from Waterford town
W:Whether she be alive or no?"
W:
W:"No she's not alive for she is dead
W:And it's many the day ago,
W:No, she's not alive for she is dead,
W:And in her grave laid low."
W:
W:"O give to me my bridle rein,
W:My milk-white steed let it go,
W:That I may go to some fine counteree
W:Where no one does me know."
W:
W:"O do not go, kind sir", she did say,
W:"Come sit yourself down by my side,
W:It's the bailiff's daughter now that you see
W:And she's ready for to be your bride."
W:
W:"O it's farewell woe and welcome love
W:It's a thousand times brighter for to see,
W:It's the bailiff's daughter now that I've gained
W:That I never more expected to see."
