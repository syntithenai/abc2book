w:Come_ all you bold_ young thought-less men A warn-ing take by me And think of my_ un_hap-py fate To be hanged up-on the tree
W:Come all you bold young thoughtless men,
W:A warning take by me;
W:And think of my unhappy fate
W:To be hanged upon the tree.
W:
W:My name is William Corder,
W:The truth I do declare;
W:I courted Maria Marten,
W:Most beautiful and fair.
W:
W:I promised her I'd marry her,
W:All on one certain day;
W:Instead of that I was resolved
W:To take her life away.
W:
W:I went unto her father's house
W:Upon the eighteenth day of May.
W:'0 come my dearest Ria,
W:And we'll fix the wedding day.
W:
W:?If you will meet me at the Red Barn,
W:As sure as I have life,
W:I will take you down to Ipswich Town
W:And there make you my wife.?
W:
W:He straight went home and fetched his gun,
W:His pick-axe and his spade;
W:He went unto the Red Barn,
W:And there he dug her grave.
W:
W:With heart so light she thought no harm,
W:To meet him she did go;
W:He murdered her all in the barn,
W:And he laid her body low.
W:
W:And all things being silent,
W:They could not take no rest,
W:Which appeared in her mother?s house
W:When suckled at her breast.
W:
W:Her mother had a dreadful dream,
W:She dreamed it three nights o'er,
W:She dreamed that her dear daughter
W:Lay beneath the Red Barn floor.
W:
W:They sent her father to the barn,
W:And in the ground he thrust;
W:And there he found his daughter dear
W:Lay mingling with the dust.
W:
W:Come all you young thoughtless men,
W:Some pity look on me;
W:On Monday next will be my last,
W:To be hanged upon the tree.
