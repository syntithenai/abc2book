N:Very similar to "Nonesuch"
H:The title was derived from a ballad probably written in 1642-3 while

Q:100
R:Jig
H:There are two distinct tunes named "Heartsease" and considerable
H:differences of opinion as to whether any of the known lyrics fit either
H:of them. The earliest lyric is "a songe to the tune of hartes ease"
H:from Thomas Richardes' play on an Italian model, called "Misogonus" (c.
H:1560).  Although it scans well, the text is arranged in short verses
H:which would only use half the dance tune, implying that an earlier tune
H:by this name may have had only one strain.
H:
H:Richard Dering's
H:catch "Cries of London" is set to the A strain.
H:
H:Hearts-ease in
H:16th century herbal culture was the little wild pansy, known today as
H:Johnny-jump-up.  It was also called "Love in Idleness".
W:Misogonus:
W:Singe care away with sport & playe
W:Pasttime is all our
W:pleasure
W:Yf well we fare, for nought we care
W:In mearth our
W:constant treasure ...
W:

H:With two titles of Welsh derivation, both of which escape convincing
H:explanation, this unique progressive dance is paired with a 16th
H:century double-tonic circular tune of haunting familiarity.  The title
H:of the song also connects the tune to Wales, Shropshire lying in the
H:foothills on the English side of the border.
W:Chappell quotes the first of 16 verses set to this tune in the 17th
W:century:
W:The Shrop-shire Wakes, or hey for Christmas, being the
W:delightful sports of most countries, to the tune of
W:Dargason.

W:Come Robin, Ralph, and little Harry

H:flowers, once grew plentifully of its hillsides but was stripped away

H:Simpson feels that the surviving tune is not the one which had some

H:curious fragment of text found in the 18th century Percy folio MS, a
H:source of dubious authenticity itself.
H:Came you not from
