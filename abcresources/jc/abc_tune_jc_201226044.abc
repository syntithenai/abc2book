%% From Seattle, WA, Pat Spaeth is one great
%% piano player. She can really _play_ the piano - melody, back-up, whatever.
%% One of the treats of my life is to listen to her playing for the S-Curves at the Folklife
%% Festival. WOW! Between what they're doing with their marvelous singing,
%% and what she's doing with her wonderful accompaniment, it makes for one
%% of my all-time favorite musical experiences. Thanks so much, Pat, for your
%% part in giving us all so much pleasure -- It's worth going to Folklife, just
%% for that!
