T:ddau farch pseudo G lydian [Two Horses/Steeds]
H:The pseudo G lydian, with a Bb, is one of the old Welsh pipe tunings -
H:drone on G, . I'm not sure if it is technically G lydian which would have
H:a natural B of course, but it's definately the tuning of the pibgorn (a
reed
H:instrument - a bagpipe if you like) that I played at the museum of folk
life.
H:In Welsh, it's one of the ancient tunings and is called "Y Gogywair". ie a
H:flat 3rd.
