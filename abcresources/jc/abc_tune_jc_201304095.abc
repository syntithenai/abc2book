w:Three gyp-sies be-trayed her and stole her_ a--way
W:
W:‘Twas down in a valley a fair maid did dwell,
W:She lived with her uncle, as all knew full well;
W:‘Twas down in the valley, where violets were gay,
W:Three gypsies betrayed her and stole her away.
W:
W:Long time she’d been missing and could not be found,
W:Her uncle, he searched the country around,
W:Till he came to her trustee, between hope and fear,
W:The trustee made answer “She has not been here’
W:
W:The trustee spake up with a courage so bold,
W:“I fear she’s been lost for the sake of her gold;
W:So we’ll have life for life, sir,” the trustee did say,
W:“We shall send you to prison, and there you shall stay!’
W:
W:There was a young squire that loved her so,
W:Oft times to the schoolhouse together they did go;
W:“I'm afraid she is murdered; so great is my fear,
W:If I’d wings like a dove I would fly to my dear!”
W:
W:He travelled through England, through France and through Spain,
W:Till he yentured his life on the watery main;
W:And he came to a house where he lodged for a night,
W:And in that same house was his own heart’s delight.
W:
W:When she saw him, she knew him, and flew to his arms,
W:She told him her grief while he gazed on her charms.
W:“How came you to Dublin, my dearest, I pray?”
W:“Three gypsies betrayed me, and stole me away?’
W:
W:“Your uncle’s in England; in prison doth lie,
W:And for your sweet sake is condemned for to die’
W:“Carry me to old England, my dearest,” she cried;
W:
W:“One thousand I’ll give you, and will be your bride!’
W:When she came to old England, her uncle to see,
W:The cart it was under the high gallows tree.
W:“Oh, pardon! oh, pardon! oh, pardon! I crave!
W:Don’t you see I’m alive, your dear life to save?”
W:
W:
W:Then straight from the gallows they led him away,
W:The bells they did ring, and the music did play;
W:Every house in the valley with mirth did resound,
W:As soon as they heard the lost lady was found.
