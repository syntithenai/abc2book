W:First I loved William and then I loved John,

W:It's fiddling and dancing was all his delight,
W:And keeping flash company has ruined him quite,
W:Has ruined him quite and a great many more,
W:If he hadn't kept flash company he had never been so poor.
W:
W:Oh, take this yellow handkerchief in remembrance of me,
W:And wear it all round your neck when in flash company.
W:Dry up your briny tears and don't look so sad,
W:There's plenty more flash girls all wish to be had.
