W:A dashing young lad from Buckingham
W:Once a great wager did lay
W:That he'd pass all the watchmen in London
W:But devil a word would he say.
W:
W:(Chorus)
W:But still he'd sing, Fol de rol id-dle ol;
W:Still he'd sing, Fol de rol lay;
W:Still he'd sing, Fol de rol id-dle ol;
W:Fol de rol ar-il-ol-day.

W:(A verse is missing here)
W:
W:The gentlemen riding beside him
W:They stopped him at the Trooper's Gate;
W:And all that e'er they could do with him
W:The devil a word would he speak.
W:
W:"The man has got drunk with good liquor
W:Or else he is turned in his brain
W:We'll send him to Newgate till morning,
W:By then he'll be sober again."
W:
W:(A verse is here missing, in which the lad is brought before the Lord Mayor)
W:
W:"this man he did nothing but sing
W:All night that in Newgate he lay;
W:So we brought him before you this morning
W:To hear what your Worship would say."
W:
W:The lord's daughter sitting beside him,
W:And very hard for him she prayed;
W:"O father, come grant him his pardon,
W:It is for some wager he's laid."
W:
W:"O daughter, O daughter, dear daughter
W:And since that it is your desire,
W:A pardon to him I will grant
W:If he'll pay all these officers' hire."
W:
W:
W:Then he put his hand in his pocket,
W:And paid them down every one,
W:He gave a low bow to the lady
W:And then he went singing along.
