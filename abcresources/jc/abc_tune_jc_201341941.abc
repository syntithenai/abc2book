W:When Christ our Lord was born;
W:He was crucified betwixt two thieves,
W:And crown-ed with the thorn
W:
W:O mortal man, remeber well
W:When Christ died on the rood,
W:'Twas for our sins and wicked ways
W:Christ shed his precious blood.
W:
W:O mortal man, remember well
W:When Christ was wrapped in clay,
W:He was taken to a sepulchre
W:Where no man ever lay.

W:God bless the mistress of this house
W:With gold all round her breast;
W:Where e'er her body sleeps or wake,
W:Lord, send her soul to rest.

W:God bless the master of this house
W:With happiness beside;
W:Where e'er his body rides or walks
W:Lord Jesus be his guide.

W:God bless your house, your children too,
W:Your cattle and your store;
W:The Lord increase you day by day,
W:And send you more and more.
