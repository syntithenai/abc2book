W:As I was going to Banbury,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:As I was going to Banbury,
W:I saw a fine codlin apple tree,
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
W:
W:And when the codlins began to fall,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:And when the codlins began to fall,
W:I found five hundred men in all.
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
W:
W:And one of the men I saw was dead,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:And one of the men I saw was dead,
W:So I sent for a hatchet to open his head.
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
W:
W:And in his head I found a spring,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:And in his head I found a spring,
W:And seven young salmon a-learning to sing.
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
W:
W:And one of the salmon as big as I,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:And one of the salmon as big as I,
W:Now do you not think I am telling a lie?
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
W:
W:And one of the salmon as big as an elf,
W:Ri fol lat-i-tee O,
W:And one of the salmon as big as an elf -
W:If you want any more you can sing it yourself!
W:With a ri fol lat-i-tee O.
