W:Chorus:
W:And a beggin' I will go
W:And a beggin' I will go
W:
W:I've a bag for me oatmeal
W:And another for me salt
W:A little pair of crutches
W:Tha should see how I can halt
W:
W:Me breeches thay are nobbut holes
W:But me heart is free of care
W:As long as I've a belly full
W:Me arse it can go bare
W:
W:There's a bed for me where e'er I lie
W:And I don't pay no rent
W:I've got no noisy looms to mind
W:And I am reet content
W:
W:I rest when I am tired
W:I heed no master's bell
W:A man would be mad to be a king
W:When beggars live so well
W:
W:I've a black patch on my fusti coat
W:And another on my ee
W:But when it comes to tuppeny ale
W:I'll see as well as thee
W:
W:I've bin deef at Dunkinfield
W:And I've bin blint at Shaw
W:And many a reet and willin' lass
W:I've bedded in the straw
