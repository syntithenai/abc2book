w: But I'll not know the spring-*time till he comes back to_ me.
W:Beyond the distant mountains on Mayday of this year
W:My soldier boy went marching and left me lonely here.
W:The flowers in the meadow are beautiful to see,
W:But I'll not know the springtime till he comes back to me.
W:
W:He begged me to go with him and journey far away,
W:But I was young and fearful and chose instead to stay.
W:The birds sing in the blue sky and nest in every tree,
W:But I'll not know the springtime till he comes back to me.
W:
W:The market in Llangollen was merry as a fair,
W:And every day he'd meet me and we'd be happy there.
W:The stalls and bright with treasures from far across the sea,
W:But I'll not go to market till he comes back to me.
