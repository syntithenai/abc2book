w:  Ma-ria-ni-na, Ma-ria-ni-na,  Come, O come and turn us in-to foam!"
W:O'er the ocean flies a merry fay,
W:Soft her wings are as a cloud of day,
W:As she passes all the blue waves say:
W:"Marianina, do not roam,
W:Whither, whither is your home,
W:Come and turn us into foam,
W:Marianina, Marianina,
W:Come, O come and turn us into foam!"
W:
W:O'er the fields she passes to and fro,
W:By the cornstalks standing row by row,
W:Poppies whisper as they see her go,
W:"Marianina, little friend,
W:Whither would your footsteps wend,
W:Come and teach us how to bend,
W:Marianina, Marianina,
W:Come, O come and teach us how to bend."
W:
W:O'er the mountains when the day is done,
W:When the clouds are gath'ring o'er the sun,
W:While they, weeping, whisper one by one-
W:"Marianina, come again,
W:We have tried to dance in vain,
W:Come and turn us into rain,
W:Marianina, Marianina,
W:Come, O come and turn us into rain."
