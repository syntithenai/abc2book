%% Kendell Kardt used to live here
%% in Peeterborough. He's a real fine guitar player and has a
%% fine singing voice to go along with it. A year or so ago
%% he moved down to Tennessee, where he is playing
%% piano with a group down there. It sounds like fun.
%% He got to picking fiddle tunes out on his guitar, and so I thought
%% he might like to try this one and see how it goes. Best wishes
%% always to you, Kendell.
