w:Oh roll, A-la-ba-ma roll!
W:Oh, in eighteen hundred and sixty one,
W:(Chorus: Roll, Alabama, roll!)
W:This ship her building was begun,
W:(Chorus: Oh roll, Alabama, roll!)
W:
W:When the Alabama's keel was laid,
W:This ship her building was begun.
W:
W:Oh, she was built in Birkenhead,
W:Built in the yard of Johnathan Laird.
W:
W:And down the Mersey she rolled one day,
W:An' across western she ploughed her way [Bound to Faya she]
W:
W:With British guns, oh, she was stocked,
W:She sailed from Fayal - in Cherbourg she docked.
W:
W:To fight the North, Semmes did employ,
W:Any method to kill an' destroy.
W:
W:But off Cherbourg the Kearsarge lay tight,
W:Awaiting was Winslow to start a good fight [spoling to fight]
W:
W:Outside the three-mile limit they fought,
W:An' Semmes escaped on a fine British yacht.
W:
W:The Kearsarge won - Alabama so brave,
W:Sank to the bottom to a watery grave.
