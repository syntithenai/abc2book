W:There was a man out in the land,
W:He courted a maiden fair;
W:He promised to take her to northern lands,
W:There the marriage should be.

W:"Go get some of your father's gold,
W:Some of your mother's fee;
W:Get two of the horses that stand in the stalls,
W:That stand by forty and three.
W:
W:"Dismount, dismount your milky steed
W:And deliver it unto me;
W:For six king's daughters have I drowned,
W:And the seventh one you shall be.
W:
W:"Pull off, pull off your silky robe
W:And deliver it unto me;
W:For I think it is too costly
W:To roll in the deep blue sea."
W:
W:"If I must pull off my silky robe,
W:Please turn your back on me;
W:For I think it's not nice, you know,
W:A naked maiden to see."
W:
W:He turned his back all unto her;
W:She wept most bitterly;
W:She grabbed him round his thin small waist
W:And tumbled him into the sea.
W:
W:He waved on high, he waved on low,
W:He waved till he came to her (side?):
W:"Take hold of my hand, my pretty Pauline,
W:And you shall be my bride."
