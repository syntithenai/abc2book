%% Here's a tune for Larry Siegal of
%% Westmoreland, NH. Larry's an excellent piano player and he's
%% been awfully nice to me. He even wrote me a real fine jig a while
%% ago that I like very much - it's a good tune, Larry, and thanks a
%% lot - I hope this tune pleases you as much as yours did me!
