w:And we scar the face of Eng-land for to make the wa-ter-way
W:I am a navigational and I come from County Cork,
W:And I had to leave me native home to find a job of work.
W:The crops were bad in Ireland and the tax too much to pay
W:And so here I am in England digging up the waterway.
W:
W:Once I was a ploughman and I did a decent job,
W:I worked from dawn 'til darkness just to earn me copule o' bob,
W:But when the praties died on us I couldn't pay me way,
W:And so here I am in England ploughing up the waterway.
W:
W:The lads who built the waterway they are a motley crew,
W:And when we've sweated all day long we like a drink or two,
W:The local folk don't take to use, but still I'm proud to say,
W:In years to come our monument will be the waterway.
