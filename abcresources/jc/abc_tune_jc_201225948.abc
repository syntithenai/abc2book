%% Last month I was playing
%% dances with great Fairbanks fiddler Rex Blazer in Anchorage and in
%% Juneau (AK). We had such fun playing together. Jim Haask called in Anchorage,
%% and Tom Paul called in Juneau. We sure had a wonderful time. It was in Juneau
%% that I met a young fiddler named Leif Saya. He's well on his way to being
%% a real fine fiddler, and you'll be hearing from him someday before long.
%% Good Luck to you, Leif!
