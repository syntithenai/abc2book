W:She dressed herself up like a sailor, on her breast she wore a star,
W:Her beautiful fingers long and slender, she gave them all just a smear of tar.
W:
W:On this ship there being a skirmish, she being one amongst the rest,
W:A silver button flew off her jacket, there appeared her snow white breast.
W:
W:Said the captain to his fair maid, what misfortune has took you here,
W:I'm in search of my true lover, whom you pressed on the other year.
W:
W:If you're in search of your true lover, pray come tell to me his name,
W:Willy Taylor they do call him but Fitzgerald is his name.
W:
W:Let you get up tomorrow morning, early as the break of day,
W:There you'll find your Willy Taylor, walking along with his lady gay.
W:
W:She got up the very next morning, early as the break of day,
W:There she spied her Willy Taylor walking along with his lady gay.
W:
W:She drew about a brace of pistols that she had at her command,
W:There she shot her Willy Taylor with his bride at his right hand.
W:
W:When the Captain came to hear it, of the deed that she had done,
W:He made her ship's commander, over a vessel for the Isle of Man.
