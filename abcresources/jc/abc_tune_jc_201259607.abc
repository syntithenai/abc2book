w: Ooh! ye Noo York gals, Can't ye dance the pol-ka?
W:As I walked down the Broadway,
W:One evening in July,
W:I met a maid who asked my trade,
W:A Sailor John, sez I
W:(Chorus:)
W:Then away, you Santee, my dear Annie!
W:Ooh! you Noo York gals,
W:Can't ye dance the polka?
W:
W:To Tiffany's [Nelligan's/a fancy store] I took her,
W:I did not mind expense
W:I bought her two gold earrings [I bought a slap-up supper],
W:An' they cost me fifteen cents [That cost me fifteen cents]
W:
W:Sez she, "You Limejuice sailor,
W:Now see me home you may."
W:But when we reached her cottage door,
W:She this to me did say.
W:
W:My flash man he's a Yankee,
W:Wid his hair cut short behind,
W:He wears a pair o' long sea-boots [red-topped boots, brass-bound jacket]
W:An' he sails the Blackball line [he's Bosun in the Blackball Line].
W:
W:He's homeward bound this evening,
W:An' wid me he will stay.
W:So git a move on, sailor-boy,
W:Get crackin' on yer way.
W:
W:So I kissed her hard and proper,
W:Afore her flash man came,
W:An' fare-ye-well, me Bowery gel,
W:I know yer little game.
W:
W:I wrapped me glad rags round me,
W:An' to the dock did steer.
W:I'll never court another maid,
W:I'll stick to rum an' beer.
W:
W:I joined a Yankee blood-boat,
W:An' sailed away next morn.
W:Don't ever fool around wid gals,
W:Yer safer off Cape Horn!
