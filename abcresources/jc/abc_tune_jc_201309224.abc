w:Caus-ed many a lad and many a lass to go there a-mak-ing hay.
W:'Twas in the merry month of May in the Springtime of the year,
W:All down in yonders meadows there runs a river clear,
W:And to see those little fishes how they do sport and play,
W:Caused many a load and many a lass to go there a-making hay.
W:
W:In comes three jolly scythesmen to cut those meadows down,
W:With a good leathern bottle and the ale that is so brown;
W:For there's many a smary young labouring man comes here his skill to try,
W:He whets, he mows, and he stoutly blows for the grass cuts devilish dry.
W:
W:Then in come both Will and Tom with pitchfork and with rake,
W:And likewise black-eyed Susan the hay all for to make;
W:For the sun did shine most glorious and the small birds they did sing,
W:From the morning till the evening as we goes haymaking.
W:
W:Then just as bright Phoebus the sun was a-going down,
W:Along comes two merry piping men approaching from the town.
W:They pulled out the tabor and pipes, which made the hay-making girls to sing,
W:They all threw down their forks and rakes and left off haymaking.
W:
W:They called for a dance and they jigged it along,
W:They all lay on the haycocks till the rising of the sun.
W:With "jug! jug! jug! and sweet jug!" how the nightingale did sing!
W:From the evening till the morning as we goes haymaking.
