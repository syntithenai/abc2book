w:Oh, the old turf fire_ and the hearth swept clean,
E/D/ |C3/2=B,/ C3/2D/ E3/2D/ E3/2F/ | G3/2E/ C3/2D/ G3
w:There is no-one half so hap-py as my-self and Pad-dy Keane;
F/E/ |D3/2D/ D3/2D/ d3/2d/ c3/2d/ |e3/2d/ c3/2A/ c2

w: He has big_ tow-'ring man--sions and cas-tles o-ver all
((3:2A=Bc) |d3/2c/ (3:2AAG F3/2D/ A3/2G/ | F3/2D/ D3/2C/ D4 |]
w:But__ sure I would-n't ex-change with him my lit-tle mar-ble hall."
