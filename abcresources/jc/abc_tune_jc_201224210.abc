%% "Shrouded in the
%% mists of antiquity" pretty well sums it up - Surely Neil Rossi
%% and I had our first encounter some time ago, perhaps at
%% the Old Joe Clarks on Arrow St. in Cambridge, MA. Neil
%% lives in Westford, VT now with lovely wife Donna, and
%% I'm glad this tune is for him. I hope it lays well on your
%% fiddle, Neil!
