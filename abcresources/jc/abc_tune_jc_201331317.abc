N: From a tune book which is part of the Cocks Collection held by Northumberland Record Office  at
N: Gosforth, with photocopies at the Black Gate and Morpeth Chantry. The book is a real miscellany
N: of styles, and covers the gamut of 19th century light music. It is anonymous, and evidently the
N: work  of  several  different  hands,  but  nevertheless has some traditional items of interest,
N: including some rare and unique tunes.
