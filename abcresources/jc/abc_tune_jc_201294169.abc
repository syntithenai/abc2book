W:As I was a-walking to Newry on day
W:I met Sergeant Kelly by chance on the way,
W:Say he, "Johnny Gallagher, will you come along
W:To the sweet town of Newry for to take a dram?"
W:
W:As we were a-sitting and taking a dram,
W:Says he, "Johnny Gallagher, you're a handsome young man,
W:If you 'list and take the bounty and come along with me,
W:To the sweet town of Antrim, strange faces you'll see."
W:
W:I may go where I Will, I have no-one to mourn
W:My mother is dead and will never return,
W:My father's twice married and a wife he brought home,
W:And to me he proves cruel and does me disown.
W:
W:He put his hand in his pocket, one shilling he drew,
W:Saying, "Take this, Johnny Gallagher, I hope you'll never run."
W:I took up the shilling, and the bargain was made,
W:The ribbons were brought out and pinn'd on my cockade.
W:
W:"When you get to Waterford, there you must stand,
W:Before your noble Colonel with you hat in your hand."
W:Mackay and Pat Reilly were a little too low,
W:So back to County Antrim from us they must go.
W:
W:Here's adieu to Country Antrim where I was born and bred
W:And to sweet Country Leitrim where I've sported and play'd
W:Where the beautiful fishes come rolling along;
W:A long day and a short night would bring me to my home.
W:
W:Here's a curse on my father wherever he be,
W:For he's been the ruin and the downfall of me;
W:I he have prov'd honest and learn'd me my trade
W:I would never have 'listed or worn a cockade.
W:
W:God help all poor parents that rear a bad son,
W:They know not the dangers that they have to run,
W:Locked in a cold guardhouse all night to lie in,
W:Neither blanket nor sheets for to roll themselves in.
