v1~Hark where the night is falling
hark hear the pipes a calling
Loudly and proudly calling down thru the glen
There where the hills are sleeping
Now feel the blood a leaping
High as the spirits of the old highland men

ch~Towering in gallant fame
Scotland my mountain hame
High may your proud standards gloriously wave
Land of my high endeavor
Land of the shining river
Land of my heart forever, Scotland the Brave

v2~High in the misty mountains
Out by the purple highlands
Brave are the hearts that beat beneath Scottish skies
Wild are the winds to meet you
Staunch are the friends that greet you
Kind as the love that shines from fair maidens eyes

v3~Faroff in sunlit places,
Sad are the Scottish faces,
Yearnin' to feel the kiss of sweet Scottish rain.
Where tropic skies are beaming,
Love sets the heart a'dreaming,
Longing and dreaming for the homeland again!
(Chorus)
