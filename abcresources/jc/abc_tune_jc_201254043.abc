Composed for the dance "Inverugie Castle" which is a 32S+32J medley devised by Joyce Elliott.   The
dance and tune were published by the RSCDS Leicester Branch in their Crystal Collection of 1992 and
was recorded by the Lothian Scottish Dance Band for a cassette to complement the  book.   The  tune
River Ugie, also composed by myself, should be used as the strathspey tune for this medley.
