%% Joe Cummings was a nice kid when I had him
%% in class years ago. He's still nice, and today his Transcript Press
%% is where I go to get these little books printed. Pretty neat, don't you
%% think? I'm so happy with what he does that I wrote him a tune of his
%% own. If he ever shows up at one of our dances, we'll have to play it
%% for him. Thanks for such excellent work, Joe - I really appreciate it!
