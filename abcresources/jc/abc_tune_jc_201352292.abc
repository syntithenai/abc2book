W:Near Howden town, near Howden town, as I have heard them tell,
W:There once was a white hare who used there to dwell;
W:She's been hunted by the greyhounds and beagles so fair,
W:But ne'er a one amongst them could come near the white hare.
W:With my fol de dol, etc.
W:
W:When they came to the place where this white hare used to lie
W:They uncoupled the beagles and began for to try;
W:They uncoupled the beagles and beat the brush around
W:But never a white hare in that field was to be found.
W:
W:It's Jemmy the huntsman and Tom the whipper-in
W:Go look in yonder fernside and see if she be in;
W:With that she took a jump, boys, and fast away she ran,
W:"It's yonder she is going, don't you see her, gentlemen?"
W:
W:The footmen they did run and the huntsmen they did ride,
W:Such halloing and shouting there was on every side;
W:Such halloing and shouting I ne'er before did know,
W:As though she had been running all the time through.
W:
W:The huntsmen and the footmen they all drew nigh,
W:Thinking that the white hare was going for to die;
W:She slipt out of the bush and thought to run away,
W:But cruel were the beagles that caused her to stay.
W:
W:'Twas twenty good beagles that caused her to die,
W:There was not a one amongst them above a foot high;
W:The number of dogs there's not to be found,
W:Nor ever better hunting upon the English ground.
