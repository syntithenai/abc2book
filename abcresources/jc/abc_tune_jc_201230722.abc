%% My fiddler friend, John
%% Brennan, from down Philly way, has gone quite far into the
%% jewelry business, which he does at home. When he makes
%% something really pretty, which is usually what happens,
%% then he is apt to tune up his fiddle and play a lovely Irish
%% tune to celebrate it. His little company is called "Stony Creek"
%% (he lives right next to it), and he's having a wonderful time.
