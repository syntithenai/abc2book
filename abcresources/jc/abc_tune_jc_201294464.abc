W:Come, all jolly ploghboys, come help me for to sing,
W:I'll sing in the praise of the plough,
W:For though we must labour from summer to spring
W:We all will be merry boys now.
W:
W:We've hir-ed, we've mir-ed, through mire and through clay,
W:No pleasure at all could we find;
W:Now we'll laugh, dance and sing, and drive care away,
W:No more in this world to repine.
W:
W:Here's April, here's May, here's June and July,
W:'Tis a pleasure to see the corn grow;
W:In August we moil it, shear low and reap high,
W:And bind up our scythes for to mow.
W:
W:So now we have gathered up every sheaf,
W:And scrape-ed up every ear;
W:We'll make no more to-do, but to plough and to sow,
W:And provide for the very next year.
