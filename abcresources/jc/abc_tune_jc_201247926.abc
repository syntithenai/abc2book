w:As I was a-walk-ing one morn-ing by chance, I heard a maid mak-ing her moan - I asked what was the mat-ter, she said in a flut-ter - I'm ob-liged to lie tumb-ling a-lone a-lone_I'm ob-liged to lie tumb-ling a-lone_
W:As I was a-walking one morning by chance
W:I heard a maid making her moan
W:I asked what was the matter, she said in a flutter
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone, alone,
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone.
W:
W:I said: My fair maid, where did you come from
W:Or are you some distance from home?
W:My home, replies she, is a burden to me
W:For I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone, alone,
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone.
W:
W:When I was eleven, sweethearts I had seven
W:But then I was fitting for none
W:But now I am fit ne'er a one can I get
W:For I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone, alone,
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone.
W:
W:My sister a girl was wed at sixteen
W:And she has fine babes of her own
W:And here I am now in my sweet twenty-one
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone, alone,
W:I'm obliged to lie tumbling alone.
W:
W:I wish some brisk fellow would pity my case
W:And make me a bride of his own
W:For I vow and declare I shall die in despair
W:If I lie one night longer alone, alone,
W:If I lie one night longer alone.
