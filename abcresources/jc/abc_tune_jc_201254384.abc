w:He put_ his pack all_ on his_ back, And so mer-ri-ly trudg-ed o'er_ the lea.
W:There chanced to be a Pedlar bold,
W:A Pedlar bold there chanced to be;
W:He put his pack all on his back,
W:And so merrily trudg-ed he o'er the lea.
W:
W:By chance he met two troublesome men,
W:Two troublesome men they chanced to be,
W:The one of them was bold Robin Hood,
W:And the other was little John so free.
W:
W:"O Pedlar, Pedlar, what is in thy pack?
W:Come speedily and tell to me."
W:"I've several suits of the gay green silks,
W:And silken bowstrings by two or three."
W:
W:"If you have several suits of the gay green silk,
W:And silken bowstrings by two or three,
W:Then, by my body," cries little John,
W:"One half your pack shall belong to me."
W:
W:"O nay, O nay," says the Pedlar bold,
W:"O nay, O nay, that can never be,
W:For there's never a man from fair Nottingham,
W:Can take one half my pack from me."
W:
W:Then little John  he drew his sword,
W:The Pedlar by his pack did stand,
W:They fought until they both did sweat,
W:Till he cried, "Pedlar, pray hold your hand."
W:
W:Then Robin Hood he was standing by,
W:And he did laugh most heartily,
W:Saying, "I could find a man of smaller scale,
W:Could thrash the Pedlar and also thee."
W:
W:"Go you try, master", says little John,
W:"Go you try, master, most speedily,
W:For by my body," says little John,
W:"I am sure this night you will know me."
W:
W:Then Robin Hood he drew his sword,
W:And the Pedlar by his pack did stand;
W:They fought till the blood in streams did flow,
W:Till he cried "Pedlar, pray hold your hand.
W:
W:"O Pedlar, Pedlar, what is thy name?
W:Come speedily and tell to me."
W:"Come, my name I ne'er will tell,
W:Till both your names you have told to me."
W:
W:
W:"The one of us is Robin Hood,
W:And the other little John so free."
W:"Now," says the Pedlar, "it lays to my good will,
W:Whether my name I choose to tell to thee.
W:
W:"I am Gamble Gold of the gay green woods,
W:And travelled far beyond the sea,
W:For killing a man in my father's land,
W:And from my country was forced to flee."
W:
W:"If you a Gamble Gold of the gay green woods,
W:And travelled far beyond the sea,
W:You are my mother's own sister's son.
W:What nearer cousins can we be?"
W:
W:They sheathed their swords, with friendly words,
W:So merrily they did agree,
W:They went to a tavern and there they dined,
W:And cracked bottles most merrily.
