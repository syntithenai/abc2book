%% The tune aims to tell the story of the three "Dancing Dragons" in flight:
%% the A part of the tune, especially the down-and upward pattern in
%% bars 1-2 and 5-6 simulates the beating of the dragons' wings,
%% the shorter phrases indicating quicker wingbeats and the shift from minor to
%% major key suggesting flight becoming easier as altitude is gained.
%% The chromatic passages and longer phrases of the B part want to suggest
%% our three dragons gliding along on their outstretched wings,
%% dancing their dragon dance high in the sky.
