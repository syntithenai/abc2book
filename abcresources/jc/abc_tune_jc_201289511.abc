w:I love my_ love with a free good will.
W:All my friends fell out with me
W:Because I kept my love's company,
W:But let them say or do what they will,
W:I love my love with a free good will.
W:
W:Over the mountains I must go
W:Because my fortune is so low;
W:With an aching heart and a troubled mind
W:For leaving my true love behind.
W:
W:The Powers above look down and see
W:The parting of true love and me,
W:'Tis as hard to part the moon and sky
W:As it is to part true love and I.
W:
W:When I have gold she has her part;
W:And when I have none she has my heart;
W:And she gained it, too, with a free good will.
W:And upon my honor I love her still.
W:
W:The winter's past and the summer's come,
W:The trees are budding one by one,
W:And when my true love chooses to stay,
W:I'll stay with her till the break of day.
