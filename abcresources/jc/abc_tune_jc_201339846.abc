w:And_* brings to the labor-ing mind A spir-i-tual_ Re-la-tion.
W:Not all the gardens here on earth,
W:With every fragrant flower
W:Such beauty shows as Sharon's Rose
W:That blooms in Zion's tower.
W:The valley's lily is combin'd
W:To feast each kind sensation,
W:And brings unto the laboring mind
W:A spiritual Relation.
W:
W:With all our powers we'll sing the praise
W:Of Judah's holy Lion;
W:His power protects and still displays
W:To shield the Mount of Zion.
W:'Tis guarded by a Jaspar wall
W:'Tis Angel's admiration,
W:To see poor souls raised from the fall,
W:To Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:How vain are all things here on earth!
W:They're like the twinkling taper!
W:They either languish in the birth
W:Or vanish like a vapor.
W:Let all the earth their joys resound
W:In highest declamation,
W:There are no comforts that are found
W:Like Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:Nothing on earth so meek and mild,
W:Although so much a stranger;
W:It personates the Virgin Child
W:That slept in Bethlehem's manger.
W:'Tis fill'd with purity and love,
W:And every kind sensation;
W:'Tis chaste as is the turtle Dove,
W:'Tis Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:There's nothing found in fleshly ways
W:Nor nature's path so flowery,
W:That brings the soul such joyful days,
W:Or yields so rich a dowery.
W:Huge mounts of gold are but as dross,
W:In Wisdom's estimation,
W:To what we find who bear the cross
W:In Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:Since mercy hath our souls retrieved
W:From the infernal Lion;
W:We'll be no more by him deceived,
W:We'll take the way to Zion.
W:Sodom and Egypt we'll forsake,
W:And Babylon's sensation;
W:Our crosses we will joyful take,
W:For Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:The bands that male and female bind,
W:Lead souls to desolation;
W:Dividing joys distract the mind,
W:And end in desparation.
W:Male and female like one are known,
W:In this blest restoration;
W:Brethren and Sisters make but one,
W:In Spiritual Relation.
W:
W:Since God hath call'd us by the light,
W:To this blest resurrection;
W:We'll follow on with all our might
W:Until we reach perfection.
W:And when we quit this earthly stage
W:And reach our destination
W:We'll praise the Lamb thro' endless age,
W:For Spiritual Relation.
