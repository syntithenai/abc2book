%% The Monday Night Dance in
%% Nelson benefits greatly from the fact that Lloyd Carr doesn't mind
%% driving an hour and a half all the way from Candia just so
%% he can be there. Not only does he love to dance, but he also
%% likes to play the piano, especially when Harvey Tolman
%% plays Cape Breton tunes on his fiddle. It's such fun
%% to listen to them together. Good Stuff!
