w:With a blue cock-ade all in our hats we'll cut a gall-ant show.
W:Come all you jolly fellows and listen to my song,
W:It is a little ditty and it won't detain you long.
W:It's of a brisk young damsel who lived down in Kent,
W:And she rose up one morning and she a-nutting went.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Then a-nutting we will go, a-nutting we will go,
W:With a blue cockade all in our hats we'll cut a gallant show.
W:
W:Now it's of a brisk young ploughboy a-ploughing of his land
W:He spoke unto his horses and gently bid them stand.
W:Then he sat down upon his plough and he began to sing,
W:And he sang so melodiously it made the valleys ring.
W:
W:It's of this brisk young damsel a-nutting in the wood,
W:He sung so melodiously it charm'd her as she stood;
W:She had no longer any power in that lonely wood to stay,
W:And what few nuts she had, poor girl, she threw them all away.
W:
W:Then she came to young Johnny as he sat on his plough,
W:And said, "Young man, I really feel I cannot tell you how."
W:So he took her to some shady grove and gently laid her down,
W:She said, "Young man, I think I see the world go round and round."
W:
W:Then Johnny went back to his plough to finish of his song,
W:He said, "My pretty damsel, your mama will think it wrong."
W:But as they walk'd across the fields she on his arm did lean,
W:She said "Young man, I'd like to see the world go round again."
W:
W:Now all you brisk young maidens, attend unto my rhyme,
W:If you should a-nutting go, I pray get home in time;
W:For if you should stay too late and hear the ploughboys sing,
W:Perhaps a young ploughboy you may get to nurse up in the Spring.
