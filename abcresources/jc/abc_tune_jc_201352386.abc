W:Are you going to Whittingham fair,
W:Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
W:Remember me to one who lives there,
W:For once she (he) was a true love of mine.
W:
W:Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
W:Without any seam or needlework
W:
W:Tell her to wash it in yonder well
W:Where never spring water nor rain ever fell
W:
W:Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn
W:Which never bore blossom since Adam was born
W:
W:Now he has asked me questions three
W:I hope he will answer as many for me
W:
W:Tell him to find me an acre of land
W:Betwixt the salt water and the sea sand
W:
W:Tell him to plough it with a ram's horn
W:And sow it all over with one peppercorn
W:
W:Tell him to reap it with a sickle of leather
W:And bind it up with a peacock's feather
W:
W:When he has done and finished his work
W:O tell him to come and he'll have his shirt.
