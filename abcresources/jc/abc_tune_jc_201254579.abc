W:2. As long as the Union was faithful to her trust,
W:Like friends and brethren, kind were we, and just;
W:But now, when Northern treachery attempts our rights to mar,
W:We hoist on high the Bonnie Blue flag that bears a single star.
W:
W:3. First gallant South Carolina nobly made the stand,
W:Then came Alabama and took her by the hand;
W:Next, quickly, Mississippi, Georgia, and Florida,
W:All raised on high the Bonnie Blue flag that bears a single star.
W:
W:4. Ye men of valor gather round the banner of the right,
W:Texas and fair Louisiana join us in the fight;
W:Davis, our loved President, and Stephens statesmen are;
W:Now rally round the Bonnie Blue Flag that bears a single star.
W:
W:5. And here's to brave Virginia, the Old Dominion State.
W:With the young Confederacy at length has linked her fate.
W:Impelled by her example, now other States prepare
W:To hoist on high the Bonnie Blue flag that bears a single star.
W:
W:6. Then here's to our Confederacy, strong we are and brave,
W:Like patriots of old we'll fight, our heritage to save.
W:And rather than submit to shame, to die we would prefer
W:So cheer for the Bonnie Blue flag that bears a single star.
W:
W:7. Then cheer, boys, cheer, raise a joyous shout
W:For Arkansas and North Carolina now have both gone out;
W:And let another rousing cheer for Tennessee be given
W:The single star of the Bonnie Blue Flag has grown to be eleven!
