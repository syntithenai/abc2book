Oakey's Keeker
For notation click here
For midi soundclick here
O Oakey's! O Oakey's! What makes thee so bad?
It's enough for to make all your workmen gan mad;
We should like very well to know just what you mean,
The way you gan on from the pit to the screen.
You treat us coal-hewers just as you think fit,
The wages are small that are paid in the pit;
But what we are making we really don't know,
Since they have sent us old Maiden Law Joe.
To do all his duty is nothing but right.
But in hurting coal-hewers he takes a delight;
If he pleases the masters that's all he cares for,
Suppose that he hungers poor men to the door.
They say there's a medium in every case,
He's not a fit man to have in such a place,
For he has no feelings for men that's below-
This hairy-face rascal, old Maiden Law Joe.
This Maiden Law tyrant does nothing but shout,
Who belongs to this tub? Because it's laid out.
He smacks his old lips, his old hands he will rub,
Because he has taken the poor man's tub.
Amongst the coal-heweres how well he is known,
His hardness towards them he always has shown.
But what makes ye do it I really don't know-
Thou cruel impostor, old Maiden Law Joe.
Now Joey Badum, you silly old man!
You have nearly done all of the ill that you can;
With old age your whiskers are turning quite grey.
And I think it is time you were starting to pray.
Do you think that the masters will keep you in bread,
If you ever take ill and are confined to bed?
When you're dead with your corpse not one step would they go.
Because it's that rascal, old Maiden Law Joe.
I never did like to wish anyone harm,
But I doubt you will gan to a place where it's warm.
It's nothing but right to reap just as you sow,
And they'll burn your whiskers, when they get you below.
If the old Devil sees you, He'll give a great shout-
That's Oakey's old keeker, who laid the tubs out.
God will then say, Down to hell you must go.
If you are the keeker called Maiden-Law Joe.
