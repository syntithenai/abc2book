%% This one's for my grandson,
%% Luke McQuillen, Bill and Kristen's boy. They've
%% all just become Vermonters, moving from near Keene, NH, to
%% West Rutland, Vt, up on top of a big hill with a 270 degree
%% view. Magnificent! Make a great place to play the pipes! Well,
%% Luke, good luck in your new digs, and hope you like this little
%% tune, which comes to you with much love from the IG.
