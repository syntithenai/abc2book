%% Well, we were all going out to dinner
%% one night down Philly way, and when several of us commented
%% on the nice-looking shirt Ed Bonsall was wearing, he said,
%% "Yeah, it's my new good shirt." Johnny Brennan and I
%% both thought that would make a great name for a tune,
%% so here it is. Thanks a lot, Eddy.
