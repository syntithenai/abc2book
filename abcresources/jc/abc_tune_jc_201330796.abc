W:Now Robin was a canny lad
W:Wha had an ainly daughter;
W:He'd niver let her tak a mon,
W:Though mony a yan had sought her.
W:I'll tell you news of my exploits
W:The time the mare was shoeing
W:I steppit in ahint the lass
W:And quickly fell a-wooing.
W:
W:It's aye she eyed my auld breeks
W:The time that they were making;
W:Say I, "My lass, ne'er mind my breeks.
W:There's new yans in the making.
W:Gin ye'll agree to gang wi' me,
W:And leave the carle thy father,
W:Ye'll hae my breeks to keep in trim,
W:Myself and a' together."
W:
W:The lassie smiled and shook her head,
W:Says she "You offer's clever;
W:I think I'll gang awa' w' yan,
W:We'll baith gae on the back o't.
W:For gin I wait my father's time
W:I'll wait till I bin fifty;
W:So I think I'll tak ye at your word,
W:And make a wife sa thrifty."

W:Now Robbie was an angry man
W:For a' t' loss of his daughter,
W:Through all the town baith up and down,
W:And far an near he sought her.
W:But when he cam to our gude inn
W:And found us baith together,
W:Says I "My lad, I've tick your bairn,
W:Tho' ye mak tak my mither."
