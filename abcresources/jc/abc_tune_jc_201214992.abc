N:This tune was collected for the 2007 Hallowe'en session at O'Regan's Pub
N:As I went home the night after the last session, having had probably a
N:quart or two too much to drink, I noticed a pale woman standing by the
N:side of the road. She was dressed in a long white shift that puddled
N:around her ankles. As I drew nearer, I saw she held a fiddle and bow in
N:her right hand. Her long grey hair was floating gently around her even
N:though the night was as still as death. I slowed my pace and gazed in awe
N:as she lifted the fiddle to her chin, her left hand wafting the ghostly bow
N:towards the misty strings of the instrument. She then played the tune
N:that I have copied here, it having lost much in the transcription.
N:Her playing was light and staccato, her triplets bubbling out into the
N:still night air like a man tripping on his way out of the pub.
