w:Sing o'er his praise with-al.
W:Come listen to me, Sandy lad,
W:And I will tell you news, man,
W:What the lads at Alnwick had
W:To keep their feet in use, man,
W:The noble Duke he gave a ball,
W:Oh let his name resound by all,
W:Both young and old, both great and small,
W:Sing o'er his praise withal, man.
W:Sing o'er his praise withal.
W:
W:Now from the castle came the ball,
W:Out from the porch it flew man,
W:Cheered the heart of every soul,
W:Each to his courage drew man:
W:In Bailiffgate they kicked her fast,
W:And Narrowgate stood the hard blast.
W:The folk in Pottergate were fast,
W:The crowd like horse did smash, man.
W:The crowd like horse did smash.
W:
W:The ball then to the market flew.
W:The crowd they followed fast man.
W:The kicks it made her black and blue.
W:Her very ribs were smashed man
W:They kicked her then up Bondgate street.
W:Just like a flock of highland sheep.
W:Some skinned their shins, some lamed their feet.
W:They ran so swift and fleet, man.
W:They ran so swift and fleet.
W:
W:Each trade was active in its part,
W:The blacksmiths and the nailers,
W:Both millwrights and joiner lads.
W:The cobblers and the tailors:
W:The blacksmiths they did run with glee
W:The nailers followed up the spree.
W:The cobbler says, "It's for me
W:For cunning and for sly, man".
W:For cunning and for sly.
W:
W:The mason he came creeping out,
W:Just like a half-drowned cat, man,
W:The water made him blubber up,
W:Just like a water rat, man;
W:O Lord's he cried, "I've had bad luck,
W:For in the water, like a duck,
W:I oft went down but ay came up,
W:And now I've got ashore, man".
W:And now I've got ashore.
W:
W:Up Barney-side the ball took flight,
W:Tom ran just like a hare, man,
W:The dirt flew from his heels that night,
W:A full half mile and mair, man:
W:The gardeners of him got a sight,
W:Which put them all to running flight,
W:But Tommy bade them all good night.
W:He was so quick at flight, man.
W:He was so quick at flight.
