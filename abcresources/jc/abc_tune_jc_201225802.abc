%% It was such fun for me when this waltz
%% came along for Ashley Noonan. Ashley is the 2 year old daughter of Nicki
%% and James Noonan, and she's as cute as a bug's ear, as my mother
%% used to say. When I went to see them last summer, Ashley held the door
%% open for me and said, "Comin' in?" I nearly had a cow!!!
