w:stood in her coach to see the dra-goons on par-ade.
W:A beautiful damsel of fame and renown,
W:A gentlemen's daughter of fame and renown.
W:As she rode by the barracks, this beautiful maid,
W:She stood in her coach to see the dragoons on parade.
W:
W:They were all dressed out like gentlemen's sons,
W:With their bright shining swords and their carabine guns,
W:With their silver-mounted pistols she observed them full soon
W:Because that she loved her Enniskillen dragoon.
W:
W:You bright sons of Mars who stand on the right,
W:Whose armour does shine like the bright stars of night,
W:Saying 'Willie, dearest Willie, you've 'listed full soon
W:For to serve as a Royal Enniskillen dragoon.'
W:
W:'O Flora, dearest Flora, your pardon I crave.
W:It's now and forever I must be a slave.
W:Your parents they insulted me both morning, night and noon
W:For fear that you would wed an Enniskillen dragoon'
W:
W:'O Willie, dearest Willie, O mind what you say,
W:For children are bound, you know, their parents to obey,
W:For when we're leaving Ireland they will change their tune,
W:Saying " The Lord be with you, Enniskillen dragoon",'
W:
W:Fare you well Enniskillen, fare you well for a while,
W:And all round the borders of Erin's green isle,
W:And when the war is over, we'll return in full bloom,
W:And they'll all welcome home the Enniskillen dragoon.
