%% The light-independent (a.k.a. "dark") reactions of the Calvin Cycle comprise the second
%% half of Photosynthesis, during which plants use energy captured from sunlight to convert
%% carbon dioxide into glucose. I wrote this tune in 2008 and have played it often with
%% Elixir as well as teaching it in several workshops. It languished without a title until
%% 2014 when Kathleen and Jim Fownes (of the band Light Reaction) started sharing it.
%% The title is a nod to their band name in appreciation of their enthusiasm for the tune.
