w:But true love, I'll be_ back in the_ spring of the year.
W:"Fare ye well, lovely Nancy, for I must now leave you.
W:I am bound to th' East Indies my course for to steer.
W:I know very well my long absence will grieve you,
W:But, true love, I'll be back in the spring of the year."

W:"Oh, 'tis not talk of leaving me, my dearest Johnny,
W:Oh, tis not talk of leaving me here all alone;
W:For it is your good company that I do admire:
W:I will sigh till I die if I ne'er see you more."
W:
W:"In sailor's apparel I'll dress and go with you,
W:In the midst of all dangers your friend I will be;
W:And that is, my dear, when the stormy wind's blowing,
W:True love, I'll be ready to reef your topsails."
W:
W:"Your neat little fingers strong cables can't handle,
W:Your neat little feet to the topmast can't go;
W:Your delicate body strong winds can't endure.
W:Stay at home, lovely Nancy, to the seas do not go."
W:
W:Now Johnny is sailing and Nancy bewailing;
W:The tears down her eyes like torrents do flow.
W:Her gay golden hair she's continually tearing,
W:Saying, "I'll sigh till I die if I ne'er see you more."
W:
W:Now all you young maidens by me take warning,
W:Never trust a sailor or believe what they say.
W:First they will court you, then they will slight you;
W:They will leave you behind, love, in grief and in pain.
