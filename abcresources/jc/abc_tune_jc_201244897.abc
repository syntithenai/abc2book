w:Abroad for pleasure as I was a walkin,
w:It was on a summer, summer calm and clear
w:There I beheld a most beautiful damsel
w:Lamenting for her shepherd swain
w:
w:The fairest evening that 'ere I beheld thee,
w:Evermore with the lad I adore
w:Wilt thou go fight the French and Spaniards
w:Wilt thou leave me thus my dear?
w:
w:No more to yon green banks will I take me
w:With pleasure for to rest myself and view the lambs
w:But I will take me to yon green gardens
w:Where the pratty flowers grow
