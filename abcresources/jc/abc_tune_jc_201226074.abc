%% Have you ever been to Nellysford,
%% VA? Me neither, but I'll tell you who lives there - Rowena Owell
%% (pr. \-O-well), that's who! And Rowena is two things 1) a real neat lady,
%% and 2) a damn good flute player. So last summer we had such a
%% good time playing together for a little dance each evening at Augusta
%% that I said, "Rowena needs a tune!"  And so here it is, Rowena, and I hope
%% it toots good on your flute - see you next year, and I hope we do it
%% all over again!
