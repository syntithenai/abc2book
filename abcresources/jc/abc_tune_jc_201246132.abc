w:'Twill be an al-*ter-a-tion_ be-fore the year_ come round.
W:The first is January, the sun goeth very low,
W:And in some farmer's barton the cattle feed on straw;
W:The weather being very cold and the snow lie on the ground;
W:'Twill be an alteration before the year come round.
W:
W:The next is February, so early in the spring,
W:The farmer's plough a-going, it is a glorious thing.
W:The little lambs a-playing alongside of their dam;
W:I thought upon the increase and was thankful for the same.
W:
W:Now March is to be noted as any in the year,
W:Providing for the harvest and brewing of strong beer
W:So long before the time God knows who'll live to see;
W:Here's a health unto our King and defeat his enemy.
W:
W:For in the morning early, so early and so soon
W:I saw the innocent farmer a-sowing of his corn
W:With his gallant team come after a-smoothing of his land
W:And I hope all things will prosper whate'er he takes in hand.
W:
W:When May I walked out to hear the small birds sing
W:Their notes were so delightful paying homage to their Queen,
W:Which charms my heart to hear them as I's walking on my way,
W:'Twas each one breaking notes as they sit on yonder tree.
W:
W:'Twas in the morning early, the lark begins to sing
W:And birds are singing merriliy all in the month of June;
W:The cuckoo she's a fine bird, she whistle and she fly
W:And every time she cry "Cuckoo" the summer draweth nigh.
W:
W:Now six months I have mentioned, the seventh is July,
W:Come lads and lasses to the field our fallow for to try;
W:Let's drink, boys, and be merry, and be all of one mind
W:For night be coming on, let's make hay while sun do shine.
W:
W:Now August is the harvest and let us all advance
W:When there's meat an' liquor plenty and work do stand no chance.
W:The farmer cries "Well done, my lads, the day will be our friend
W:So we will drink and make good work until the day doth end."
W:
W:The middle of September is harvest put aside
W:In ordering of our business and dressing to provide,
W:We'll do all things in season, I think it just and right
W:For summer now is ended, 'tis cold by day and night.
W:
W:For the trees they do look naked, the leaves begin to fall,
W:October is a winter month, I hope you know it all,
W:The frost hath cut it off 'twill never more be seen
W:For he do rob the meadows of all their green.
W:
W:Now the fifth of November is the day of olden date;
W:We'll keep it in remembrance unless it be forgot;
W:So let's drink and be merry, boys, and here's a song to sing
W:For over the whole nation the bells begin to ring.
W:
W:Now December is the last of all I'm going for to mention,
W:I shan't proceed no further, it is not my intention;
W:So let's conclude and be merry, boys, and be all of good cheer
W:And I wish you a meet Xmas and a happy new Year.
