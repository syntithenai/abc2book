%% A lot of hornpipes are sped up and played as reels. My friend Sandy
%% thinks that they should be played as hornpipes if they are hornpipes.
%% On a lark, she founded the National Save the Hornpipe Society. She made
%% buttons for us all to wear. This tune is named after the society.
%% Hornpipes often have the word hornpipe as part of their title. So, properly,
%% this tune should be called Save the Hornpipe Hornpipe but that seems a bit
%% redundant. So it's just Save the Hornpipe.
