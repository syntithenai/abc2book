w:mounts his mare, to hunt the hare. Sing tal-*ly-ho!_ the hounds, Sir.
W:Mess Parson Hogg shall now maintain,
W:The burden of my song, Sir,
W:A single life, perforce he led,
W:Of constitution strong, Sir.
W:
W:Sing, tally-ho! sing, tally-ho!
W:Sing, tally-o! why zounds, Sir
W:He mounts his mare, to hunt the hare.
W:Sing tally-ho! the hounds, Sir.
W:
W:And every day he goes to Mass
W:He first draws on the boot, Sir,
W:That should the beagles chance to pass,
W:He might join  pursuit, Sir!
W:Sing tally-ho! &c.
W:
W:That parson little loveth prayer.
W:And Pater night and morn, Sir,
W:For bell and book, hath little care
W:But dearly loves the horn, Sir.
W:Sing tally-ho! &c.
W:
W:S. Stephen's Day, this holy man
W:He went a pair to wed, Sir,
W:When as the Service he began
W:Puss by the Church-yard sped, Sir.
W:Sing tally-ho! &c.
W:
W:He shut his book, come on, he said,
W:I'll pray and bless no more, Sir,
W:He drew his surplice o'er his head
W:And started for the door, Sir
W:Sing tally-ho! &c.
W:
W:In pulpit Parson Hogg was strong,
W:He preached without a book, Sir
W:And to the point, and never long,
W:And this the text he took, Sir "O tally-ho! O tally-ho!
W:Dearly beloved - zounds, Sir.
W:I mount my mare to hunt the hare,
W:Singing tally-ho! the hounds, Sir!"
