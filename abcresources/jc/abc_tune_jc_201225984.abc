%% Dave Millstone
%% is a fine caller who lives up in West Lebanon, NH, and
%% we've had a happy relationship for years, first with New
%% England Tradition, and now with Old New England. We
%% like the way you operate, Dave, and look forward to
%% our next gig together (which I personally hope is a bit _hotter_
%% than that last one!) Best wishes always to you, Dave --
