W:(Chorus)
W:On the banks of the roses, my love and I sat down,
W:He's ta'en oot his German flute to play his love a tune;
W:In the middle o' the tune, noo, the bonnie lassie cried:
W:"O, it's Johnnie, dear, O Johnnie, dinna leave me!"
W:
W:For he's ta'en oot a wee penknife as sharp as ony lance,
W:And he's plunged it right tae yon bonnie lassie's hairt;
W:He plunged it right in tae yon bonnie lassie's hairt,
W:And he left her lyin' low amang the roses.
W:
W:Noo, come a' ye traivellin' lasses, a warnin' take by me,
W:It's never let a Gorgi lad an inch abune your knee;
W:For if ye dae, ye'll be sure to rue
W:For he'll leave ye lyin' low amang the roses.
