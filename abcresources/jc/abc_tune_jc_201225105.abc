%% The Hanover area has a lot of good stuff going
%% for it, such as Dartmouth College, Mary Hitchcock Hospital, Dan and Whit's
%% General Store across the river in Norwich, VT, and two nice dance
%% halls close at hand, one in Lyme and one in Etna. There are also lots of great
%% musicians nearby, and one of these is mandolin player Rick Barrows.
%% I thought this fingered OK on my mandolin, Rick - I sure hope it
%% sounds OK on yours!
