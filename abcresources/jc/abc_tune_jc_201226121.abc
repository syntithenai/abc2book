%% This summer we
%% were truly blessed when that wonderful group of
%% Tom Anderson's former students, all young
%% fiddle players from Shetland, came through on
%% tour. They called themselves Shetland's Young
%% Heritage, and the music they played was glorious.
%% I just hope I can hear them again some day!
