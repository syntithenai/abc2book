w:It set my mind a-rov-ing To tra-vel the coun--try round.
W:I am a jovial ranger,
W:I fear no kind of danger;
W:To sorrow I'm a stranger,
W:And so let mirth abound
W:I once had a fit of loving,
W:But, that contrary proving,
W:It set my mind a-roving
W:To travel the country round.
W:
W:When first of all I started,
W:From all my friends I parted,
W:All almost broken hearted,
W:Alas! What grief I found!
W:Till London had fairly touched me,
W:No part of comfort reached me,
W:The devil had surely bewitched me
W:To travel the country round!
W:
W:When up to London I wandered
W:A deal of money I squandered,
W:I masters tried a hundred,
W:No work was to be found.
W:And as I wandered up and down,
W:Some called me "a fool", some "country clown",
W:And bade me get out of their fine town
W:To travel the country round!
W:
W:Now I grew quite dejected,
W:As well might be expected,
W:Myself I then directed
W:To Reading, and was "bound".
W:As soon as I arrived there,
W:Some work for me was contrived there,
W:And I for awhile was depriv'd there,
W:From trav'lling the country round!
W:
W:Six months or more, I tarried,
W:Till of Reading, I grew wearied,
W:My roaming fancy fired
W:To see some other town.
W:To Oxford then I hasted,
W:A week or more I wasted,
W:As long as money lasted
W:I travelled the country round.
W:
W:So now in Oxford my station;
W:And here, to my vexation,
W:A foolish new temptation
W:To rest awhile I found.
W:A maid I met so pretty,
W:So good, so wise, so witty,
W:I thought it were surely a pity
W:To travel the country round.
W:
W:Now I the case must alter,
W:For fear that I should falter,
W:And be led in a halter
W:To church (a dismal sound!)
W:I made a resolution
W:Which I put in execution,
W:It suited my constitution
W:To travel the country round.
W:
W:So now at home* I'm seated,
W:My travels are all completed,
W:These words U have repeated,
W:So awhile I'll sit me down;
W:Quite cured of all my moving,
W:As well as all my loving,
W:I'll go no more a-roving
W:To travel the country round
