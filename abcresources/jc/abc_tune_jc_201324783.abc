w:my de-light of a shi-ny night In the sea-son of the year.
W:When I was bound apprentice
W:In famous Somersetshire
W:I served my master truly
W:For nearly seven year,
W:Till I took up to poaching
W:As you shall quickly hear
W:For 'twas my delight of a shiny night
W:In the season of the year.
W:
W:As me and my companions
W:Were setting of a snare
W:The gamekeeper was watching us
W:But for him we did not care
W:For we can wrestle fight, my boys,
W:Jump over anywhere.
W:For it's my delight of a shiny night
W:In the season of the year.
W:
W:As me and my companions
W:Were setting for a five
W:In taking of them up again
W:We caught a hare alive
W:We popped her in the bag, my boys
W:And through the woods did steer
W:For it's my delight of a shiny night
W:In the season of the year.
W:
W:We threw her across our shoulders
W:And wandered through the town,
W:And called into a neighbour's house
W:And sold her for a crown,
W:We sold her for a crown, my boys,
W:But dared not tell you where,
W:For it's my delight on a shiny night
W:In the season of the year.
W:
W:So here's success to poachers
W:For I do not think it fair,
W:Bad luck to every gamekeeper
W:That will not sell his deer,
W:Good luck to every landlady
W:That wants to buy a hare.
W:For it's my delight on a shiny night
W:In the season of the year.
