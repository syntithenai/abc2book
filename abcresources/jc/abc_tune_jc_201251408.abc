W: There was a jovial Beggar, he had a wooden Leg;
W:Lame from his Cradle, and forced for to Beg:

W:Chorus:  And a Begging we will go, we'll go, we'll go,
W:And a begging we will go.
W:
W:A Bag for my Oatmeal, another for my Salt,
W:A little pair of Crutches, to see how I can Halt:
W:
W:A Bag for my Bread, another for my Cheese,
W:A Little dog to follow me to gather what I leese (lose):
W:
W:A Bag for my Wheat, another for my Rye,
W:A little Bottle by my side, to drink when I am dry:
W:
W:To Pimlico we'll go, where merry we shall be,
W:With ev'ry Man a Can in's Hand, and a Wench upon his Knee:
W:
W:And when that we're disposed, we ramble on the Grass,
W:With long patch'd Coats for to hide a pretty Lass:
W:
W:Seven years I served, my old Master Wild;
W:Seven years I begged whilst I was but a Child:
W:
W:I had the pretty knack, for to wheedle and to cry;
W:By young and by old, much pitied e'er was I.
W:
W:Fatherless and Motherless still was my complaint,
W:And none that ever saw me, but took me for a Saint:
W:
W:I begg'd for my Master and got him store of Pelf;
W:But Jove now be praised, I now beg for myself;
W:
W:Within a hollow Tree, I live and pay no Rent;
W:Providence provides for me, and I am well content,
W:
W:Of all Occupations, a Beggar is the best,
W:For when he is weary, he'll lie him down and rest:
W:
W:I fear no Plots against me, but live in open Cell:
W:Why who would be a King, when a Beggar lives so well?
W:
