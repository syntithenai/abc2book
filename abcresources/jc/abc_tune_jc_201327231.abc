W:To the Queen of Hearts he's the Ace of sorrow,
W:He is here today, he is gone tomorrow;
W:Young men are plenty, but sweet-hearts few,
W:If my love leave me, what shall I do?
W:
W:When my love comes in I gaze not around,
W:When my love goes out, I fall in a swound;
W:To meet is pleasure, to part is sorrow,
W:He is here today, he is gone tomorrow.
W:
W:Had I the store in yonder mountain,
W:Where gold and silver is had for counting,
W:I could not count, for the thought of thee,
W:My eyes so full that I could not see.
W:
W:I love my father, I love my mother,
W:I love my sister, I love my brother,
W:I love my friends, my relations too,
W:But I'd leave them all for the love of you.
W:
W:My father left me both house and land,
W:And servants many at my command;
W:At my commandment they ne'er shall be,
W:I'll forsake them all to follow thee.
W:
W:An Ace of sorrow to the Queen of Hearts,
W:O how my bosom bleeds and smarts;
W:Young men are plenty, but sweet-hearts few,
W:If my love leave me, what shall I do?
