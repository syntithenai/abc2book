I first heard aboot dis t\"un whin I wis aboot 14 an wis telt dat
a Northmavin fiddler \"osed ta walk to Busta Hoose in Deltng an
play him ta da Laird on Yule moarin.  Some years later, whin I
wis spaekin wi Peter Fraser, he played him ower ta me an said he
wis a very auld t\"un.  I fan oot later on at dere wis a version
printed in Hibbert's an anidder een ida Midbrake Papers (in the
Museum of Antiquities, Edinburgh).  Whin I visited da late John
Irvine o' Saltness, Whalsey (Auld Glybie), he played a version
an caaed him "Da Day o' Dawye."  He telt me dat ida aulden days
da fiddler \"osed ta geng aroond da hooses playin him first think
Yule moarin.  In papa Stour, he wis \"owed ta lead da sword
dancers onto da floor fir da "Papa Stour Sword Dance".  Da
version here is da wye I play him.  It is my opinion dat it is
da auldest fiddle t\"un we hae, an dat he is of Norse extraction.
