W:Is that an Irish title? OK, the turkey has been known in Europe
W:since 1523, but I still doubt that there is any traditional
W:*Irish* song about that bird. It's more likely that the title
W:(though, not necessarily the tune!) is of US origin. It's clear -
W:both from O'Neill and other sources - that Irish immigrants to the
W:USA tended to keep close contact with their native country and that
W:there always was an extensive cultural exchange between Ireland
W:and Irish-American communities.
