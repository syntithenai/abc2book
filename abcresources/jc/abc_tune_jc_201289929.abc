W:  I know you love me, Kathleen dear, your heart was ever fond and true.
W:  I always fear when you are near, that life holds nothing dear but you.
W:  The smiles that once you gave to me, I scarcely ever see them now,
W:  Though many, many times I see,  a dark'ning shadow on your brow.
W:    -- chorus --
W:3.
W:  To that dear home behond the sea, my Kathleen shall again return.
W:  And when thy old friends welcome thee, thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
W:  Where laughs the silver stream beside your mother's humble cot,
W:  And brighter rays of sunshine gleam, there all your grief will be forgot.
W:    -- chorus --
