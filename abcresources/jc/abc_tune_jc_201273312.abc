W:I've got a mule, her name is Sal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:She's a good old worker and a good old pal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:We've haul'd some barges in our day,
W:Fill'd them with lumber, coal and hay,
W:And we know every inch of the way
W:From Albany to Buffalo,
W:
W:Chorus
W:Low bridge, everybody down,
W:Low bridge for we're going through a town,
W:And you always know your neighbour,
W:You'll always know your pal,
W:If you've ever navigated on the Erie Canal.
W:
W:We'd better look around for a job, old gal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:'Cause you bet your life I'd never part with Sal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:Get up there mule, here comes a lock,
W:We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock.
W:One more trip and back we'll go,
W:Right back home to Buffalo.
W:
W:Oh, where would I be if I lost my pal?
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:Oh, I'd like to see a mule as good as Sal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:A friend of mine once got sore,
W:Now he's got a broken jaw,
W:'Cause she let fly with her iron toe
W:And kicked him into Buffalo.
W:
W:You'll soon hear them sing about my gal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:It's a darn fine ditty 'bout my darn fool Sal,
W:Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
W:Oh, any old band will play it soon
W:Darn fool words and darn'd fool tune,
W:You'll hear it sung before you go,
W:From Mexico to Buffalo.
