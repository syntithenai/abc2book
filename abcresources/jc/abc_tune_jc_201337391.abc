w:And ro-ving sun-light wove its dream of joys that last for--ev-_er.
W:When I was young I wandered free, like wind across the meadow,
W:Astray among the silver wheat without a path to follow.
W:And wildly sang the summer bird, and gaily danced the flower.
W:And roving sunlight wove its dream of joys that last forever.
W:
W:Then on a day of golden dawn, in sweet surprise of morning,
W:I met the one that I must love, and all my world was turning,
W:I heard the cry of curlew-sea, the kestrel-sky still called me,
W:But I was with my new-found love, and all her ways enthralled me.
W:
W:I feared the rise of harvest moon, with star-frost in its shadow,
W:When men would reap the silver wheat and the the fields lie fallow,
W:For owl would mourn the barren tree, and fox would haunt the valley,
W:And autumn wind might take from me the one I loved so truly.
W:
W:I made a crown of garland leaves, the gold within them burning,
W:And gave it to my own true love, in token of my longing,
W:Let sun-warmed summer pass away, let mountain stream go wander,
W:Like reapers we would happy stay and harvest joy together.
