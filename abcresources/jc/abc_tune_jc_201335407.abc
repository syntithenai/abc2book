W:(Chorus)
W:Hail, thou ever blessed morn;
W:Hail, redemption's happy dawn;
W:Sing through all Jerusalem,
W:Christ is born in Bethlehem.
W:
W:Lo, within a manger lies,
W:He who built the starry skies
W:He who throned in height sublime,
W:Sits amid the cherubim.

W:Say, ye holy shepherds, say
W:What your joydul news today;
W:Wherefore have ye left your sheep
W:On the lonely mountains steep?
W:
W:As we watch'd at dead of night,
W:Lo, we saw a wondrous light;
W:Angels singing 'peace on earth'
W:Told us of the Saviour's birth.
W:
W:Sacred infant, all divine,
W:What a tender love was thine,
W:THus to come from highest bliss
W:Down to such a world as this.
W:
W:Teach, O teach us, Holy Child,
W:By thy face so meek and mild,
W:Teach us to resemble thee,
W:In they sweet humility.
