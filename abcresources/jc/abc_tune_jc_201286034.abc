W:Hey for the buff and the blue
W:Hey for the cap and the feather
W:Hey for the bonny lass true
W:That lives in Hexhamshire

W:Through by the Saiby Syke
W:An over the moss and the mire
W:I'll go to see my lass,
W:Who lives in Hexhamshire
W:
W:Her faither lov'd her well
W:Her mother lov'd her better;
W:I love the lass mysel',
W:But alas! I cannot get her.
W:
W:Oh, this love, this love;
W:Of this love I'm weary!
W:Sleep, I can get none
W:For thinking on my deary!
W:
W:My heart is like to break,
W:My bosom is on fire,
W:So well I love the lass
W:That lives in Hexhamshire.
W:
W:Her petticoat is silk
W:And plaited round with siller,
W:Her shoes are tied with tape
W:She'll wait till I go till her.
W:
W:Were I where I would be
W:I would be beside her
W:But here a while I must be
W:Whatever may betide her.
W:
W:Hey for the thick and the thin
W:Hey for the mud and the mire
W:And hey for the bonny lass
W:That lives in Hexhamshire.
