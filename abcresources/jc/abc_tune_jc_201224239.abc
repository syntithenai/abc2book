%% Ruthie Dornfeld of
%% Cambridge, MA, is one of the best fiddlers I know. Team
%% her up with fellow-fiddler Mary Lea, throw in Jack
%% O'Connor on tenor banjo and Cal Howard on bass, and
%% that's one of the best combos I ever played with. Thanks for
%% what you do, Ruthie - I just love it! Sorry it's taken me so
%% long to get you a tune!
