W:Of all the birds that ever I see,
W:The owl is the fairest in her degree.
W:For all the day long she sits in a tree,
W:And when the night cometh, away flies she.
W:Chorus
W:To-whit! To-who! says she, To who!
W:Cinnamon, ginger, nutmegs and cloves,
W:And brandy gave me my jolly red nose.
W:
W:The lark in the morn ascendeth on high
W:And leaves the poor owl to sob and to sigh;
W:And all the day long, the owl is asleep,
W:While little birds blithely are singing, cheep! cheep!
W:
W:There's many a brave bird boasteth awhile,
W:And proves himself great, let Providence smile,
W:Be hills and be vallies all covered with snow,
W:The poor owl will shiver and mock with Ho! Ho!
