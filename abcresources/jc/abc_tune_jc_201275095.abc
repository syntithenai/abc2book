w: He said he could do more work in a day Than she could do in three
W:There was an old woman, there was an old man,
W:Who never could agree;
W:He said he could do more work in a day
W:Than she could do in three.
W:
W:Now said the old woman unto the old man,
W:"If this you will allow,
W:Why, you shall stay at home today
W:An' I'll go follow the plow.
W:
W:"But you must milk the teeny cow
W:For fear she will go dry,
W:An' you must feed the little pigs
W:That lay within the sty.
W:
W:"An' you must watch the speckled hen
W:For fear she'll go astray,
W:An' you must wind the bobbin of yarn
W:That I spun yesterday."
W:
W:The old woman she picked up the shares
W:To go an' follow the plow;
W:The old man he picked up the pail
W:To milk the teeny cow.
W:
W:Tenny she winked an' Teeny she blinked
W:An' Teeny curled up her nose,
W:An' give the old man such a kick in the face
W:That the blood streamed down to his toes.
W:
W:"Whoa, Teeny, haw, Teeny,
W:My good little cow, stand still,
W:An' if ever I try to milk you again
W:It'll be against my will."
W:
W:He went to feed the little pigs
W:That lay within the sty;
W:The old sow run up against his legs
W:An' knocked him ten foot high.
W:
W:He went to watch the speckled hen
W:For fear she'd go astray,
W:An' forgot to wind the bobbin of yarn
W:That his wife spun yesterday.
W:
W:He swore by the sun, he swore by the stars,
W:An' the green leaves on the tree,
W:That his wife could do more work in a day
W:Than he could do in three!
