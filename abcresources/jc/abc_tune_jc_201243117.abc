B: Sam Bayard, "Hill Country Tunes" 1944 #76
S: Played by Irvin Yaugher Jr, Mt Independence, PA, Oct 19 1943. As played by his great-uncle.
N: The title of this tune has the appearance of being an importation from the British Isles; and
N: no doubt the melody is too.  Another set, with a variant form of the title, and a different
N: second part, is in Bayard Coll., No.227, from Center County.  It is case in a different mode
N: from this, which disguises it greatly.
N:   "Bub" Yaugher knew the following rhyme associated with this tune:
N:      Possum up a gum stump,
N:      Coonie in the holler,
N:      Devil's on the other side --
N:      Don't you hear him holler?
R: reel
M: 4/4
L: 1/8
