W:  She was a fish monger, but sure 'twas no wonder,
W:  For so were her father and mother before.
W:  And the each pushed their barrow through streets broad and narrow,
W:  Crying "Cockles and Mussels! Alive, alive, oh!"
W:3.
W:  She died of a "faver," and no one could save her,
W:  And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
W:  But her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow,
W:  Crying "Cockles and Mussels! Alive, alive, oh!"
