W:Oh, Yarmouth is a pretty town,
W:And shines where it stands,
W:And the more I think of it
W:The more it runs in my mind;

W:It makes my heart to grieve,

W:Pretty Nancy did live.

W:The rout came on Sunday,
W:On Monday we march'd away:
W:The drums they did beat,
W:And the music did play.
W:Many hearts were rejoicing,
W:But my heart was sad,
W:To part from my true love
W:What a full heart I had!
W:
W:Will you go on board of ship?
W:My love, will you try?
W:I'll buy you fine seafare
W:As money will buy.
W:And while I'm on sentry
W:I'll guard you from all foe!
W:My love, will you go with me?
W:But her answer was "No!"
W:
W:Oh, Yarmouth is a pretty town,
W:And shines where it stands,
W:And the more I think of it
W:The more it runs in my mind;
W:The more I think of it
W:It makes my heart to grieve,
W:At the sign of the "Angel"
W:Pretty Nan I did leave.
