w: For to try the heart of Mar-ry Ann, the lit-tle Low-land Maid.
W:It's of a pretty sailor lad who ploughed the stormy sea,
W:He dressed himself in tarry clothes, like one in poverty;
W:His pockets being well lined, though of the sailor trade,
W:For to try the heart of Mary Ann, the little Lowland Maid.
W:
W:
W:As Mary Ann was standing down by her cottage door
W:She frowned upon her sailor lad, who seemed to be so poor.
W:She looked just like a goddess, in jewels rich arrayed,
W:But the thorn was in the bosom of the little Lowland Maid.
W:
W:
W:"Good morning;" said false Mary Ann, "I'm glad to meet with you;
W:Have you forgot your own true love, or changed your love for new?
W:Or is your inclination all on some other strayed?
W:So begone!" said lovely Mary Ann, the little Lowland Maid.
W:
W:
W:She seemed to be so scornful, so the sailor says "Behold I"
W:All from his trousers-pocket he pulls a bag of gold.
W:So then replied false Mary Ann "Excuse me what I said!
W:You're welcome to the cottage and the little Lowland Maid."
W:
W:
W:"Oh no! deceitful damsel, your falseness shall be paid,
W:For I can lie till morning in some distant barn or shed:"
W:It was the hour of twelve o'clock young Mary Ann did stray,
W:And she told some other comrade where the sailor he did lay.
W:
W:
W:They went with their dark lanterns and daggers in their hands,
W:They rode through woods and meadows, and past the muddy lands;
W:"Cheer up your hearts", said Mary Ann, "and do not be betrayed,
W:We will rob and slay the sailor for the little Lowland Maid'.'
W:
W:
W:They both then plunged their daggers into the sailor, deep;
W:They robbed him of his glittering gold, and left him there to weep.
W:A gamekeeper was watching them; all from his wood he strayed,
W:Then he swore against the villain and the little Lowland Maid.
W:
W:
W:They both then stood their trials, and were condemned, and cast;
W:And on the fatal gallows-tree they both were hung at last.
W:There were thousands flocked to see them, and scornfully they said
W:"Begone! you cruel monster, and the little Lowland Maid!"
