%% Tommy lives over in
%% Hancock, NH, on a real nice farm. He has a neat sister named
%% Sarah, and his folks are Art and Laurie Bryan. They raise great
%% big furry things (MOOO) and it's a wonderful place to visit. Art
%% used to play guitar with the Canterbury, and sometimes we still
%% get to play a few tunes together. Kids, cows, and music. You
%% can't beat that with a stick!
