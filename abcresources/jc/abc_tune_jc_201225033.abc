%% When April Limber and, later on,
%% Pete Colby and I used to play at the N.H. Folk Festivals, first at
%% Pat's Peak Ski Area in Henniker ("The Only Henniker on Earth!") and then
%% at that nice farm out on Iron Works Road in Concord, John Gfroerer
%% was always real good to us. He was the spark plug for those festivals
%% and he did a fine job. We enjoyed playing for you, John -- thanks
%% for your hospitality.
