The 'Chase' was a well known haunt for musicians in the l970's when it hosted a very successful
Accordion & Fiddle Club. It was a very popular venue for traditional music and dancing in the
Lothians and this tune was written when hosts, Alison & Bobby Colgan, decided to move on from
the Chase and start in a new venture in Musselburgh.
