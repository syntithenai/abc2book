%% Phil Katz is surely a
%% prime mover in the band "Salmonberry", out in
%% Seattle. He plays button box, and I've never met
%% anyone who has more enthusiasm for the contra
%% dance scene than he does. He once cooked us a
%% Salmon dinner that I'll never forget. It was so
%% good! I hope this tune will say "Thanks, Phil!"
