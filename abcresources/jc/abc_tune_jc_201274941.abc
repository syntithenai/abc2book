W:There was an old farmer in Cheshire,
W:To market his daughter did go,
W:And thinking that no-one would harm her 
W:As she'd oft-times been that road before.
W:
W:Her business at the market being ended
W:And all her fine goods being sold
W:Her journey back homewards she wended
W:Her pockets well lined with gold.
W:
W:She met with a rusty highwayman
W:Two pistols he held to her breast,
W:Saying deliver your money, your clothing,
W:Or else you shall die in distress.
W:
W:She being a buxom young damsel.
W:Dismounted as though unafraid,
W:One slash from her whip sent him sprawling
W:And his pistols she took as he laid.
W:
W:She put her foot in the stirrup
W:And mounted her horse like a man,
W:Then shouted back over her shoulder,
W:Catch me you old rogue if you can.
W:
W:The rogue soon follow-ed after
W:But began for to puff and to blow,
W:Then seeing he could not overtake her
W:Sat down full of sorrow and woe.
W:
W:Her father being anxious about her
W:And finding 'twas getting quite late,
W:When hoof-beats he heard fast approaching
W:As she galloped up to the farm gate.
W:
W:Oh daughter, oh, daughter, what's happened,
W:What kept you at market so long?
W:Oh father, I fell in great danger,
W:But the rogue he has done me no wrong.
W:
W:She put her grey horse in the stable,
W:And laid a white cloth on the floor,
W:They counted her money a thousand,
W:A thousand, yes a thousand times o'er.
