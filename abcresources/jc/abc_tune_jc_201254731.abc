w:love with him *as you may un-der-stand.
W:Oh, Johnny was my true love's name as you can plainly see,
W:And my father he employed him his labouring boy to be,
W:To harrow, to reap, and to sow the seed, and to plough my father's land;
W:Very soon I fell in love with him as you may understand.
W:
W:I courted him for six long months but little did I know
W:That cruel was my father; he proved my overthrow,
W:He watched us close one evening down by a shady grove
W:While pledging our vows together in the constant bands of love.
W:
W:My mother come to me one day and this to me did say;
W:'Oh your father is determined for to appoint your wedding day.'
W:Well nobly I made answer, 'It's with him I'll never comply,
W:For I'd rather live a single life or have my labouring boy.'
W:
W:'O daughter, dearest daughter, oh why do you talk so strange,
W:To marry a poor labouring boy the wide world for to range?
W:Some noble lord would fancy you better; great riches you could enjoy,
W:So do not throw your life away for a poor labouring boy.'
W:
W:'O mother, dearest mother, your talk is all in vain.
W:Your kings, lords, dukes or earls, their offer I disdain.
W:I'd rather live a single life, my time for to enjoy,
W:Then increasing nature prosper for my bonny labouring boy.'
W:
W:Five hundred pounds of my best clothes I sold that very night,
W:And with the boy who I love best to Belfast we did fly.
W:His love it has entangled me and the same I'll never deny,
W:And God may speed the plough with my bonny labouring boy.
W:
W:So fill your glasses to the brim, let the toast go merrily round;
W:Here is a health to every labouring man who ploughs and sows the ground,
W:And when his work is over, it's home he'll speed with joy,
W:And happy, happy is the girl who weds the labouring boy.
