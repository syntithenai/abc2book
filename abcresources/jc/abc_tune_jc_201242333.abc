%% Gate: Actives join nearest hand with neighbor and turn as couple with that
%% neighbor, with the actives moving forward, up or down the hall as indicated, while
%% their neighbors move backwards so that they rotate around a pivot point between
%% them.  All end where they started the figure.
%%
%% The author notes, "This dance is actually quite relaxed in pace. In order to use up
%% all the music, the tempo should be fairly peppy and the dancers should have space
%% to spread out and make wide gates. If movements are big and sweeping, it can be
%% rewarding to dance; if cramped or too slow, it has little to offer. Alert the first
%% couple that their final half figure eight ends with them dancing *up* the outside.
%% They should maintain this momentum into the heys at the beginning of the next
%% round."
%%
%% The author recommends Mairi's Wedding as an alternate tune to be used in a
%% medley with Wooing Mairi.
