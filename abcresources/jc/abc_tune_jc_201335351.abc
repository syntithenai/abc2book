w:Just as the sun_ did shine
W:As I went out one May morning,
W:One May morning betime,
W:I met a maid, from home had stray'd
W:Just as the sun did shine.
W:
W:What makes you rise so soon, my dear,
W:Your journey to pursue?
W:Your pretty little feet they tread so sweet,
W:Strike off the morning dew.
W:
W:I'm going to feed my father's flock,
W:His young and tender lambs
W:That over hill and over dales
W:Lie waiting for their dams.
W:
W:O stay! O stay! you handsome maid,
W:And rest a moment here,
W:For there is none but you alone,
W:That I do love so dear.
W:
W:How gloriously the sun doth shine,
W:How pleasant is the air,
W:I'd rather rest on my true love's breast
W:Than any other where.
W:
W:For I am thine and thou art mine;
W:No man shall uncomfort thee;
W:We'll join our hands in wedded bands
W:And married we will be.
