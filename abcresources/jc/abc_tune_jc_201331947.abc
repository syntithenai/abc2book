%% I had just returned from Fiddle Hell where I spent the weekend trying to play too
%% fast. So, in order to wind down a little I decided to play some waltzes. This tune
%% just popped out. It seemed to me that it was quite danceable and I have this image
%% of the dancers twirling 'round the room.
