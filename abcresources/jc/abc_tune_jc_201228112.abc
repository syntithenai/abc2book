%% Frank Blade says that as far
%% back as he and Dina can remember, dancing at the Folklife Festival
%% has always been held in the Roadhouse (Flag Pavilion West); This year,
%% 2002, marks the year of its relocation, to a place where new happy
%% memories will be created. This tune is to celebrate the zillion happy
%% memories of the old Roadhouse, memories which this writer is so glad
%% he shares with so many very dear friends.
