w:old_ king's house Six hours be-fore it was day, day, day, Six hours
be-fore it was day.
W:He was mounted on a milk-white steed,
W:And he led a dappled gray,
W:And he rode till he came to the old king's house
W:Six hours before it was day, day, day,
W:Six hours before it was day.
W:
W:He softly called the princess fair,
W:"Come ride abroad with me,
W:And I will take you to fair Scotland
W:And there I'll marry with thee, thee, thee,
W:And there I'll marry with thee."
W:
W:He rode upon the milk-white steed
W:And she the dappled gray,
W:And they rode till they came to the old salt sea
W:Three hours before it was day, day, day,
W:Three hours before it was day.
W:
W:"Get off your mount, my pretty fair maid,
W:And come stand here by me,
W:For here I've drownded the sixth king's daughter
W:And you the seventh shall be, be, be,
W:And you the seventh shall be.
W:
W:"Take off that gown, that Holland gown,
W:And lay it here by me,
W:For it's too fine and too costly
W:To rot in the old salt sea, sea, sea,
W:To rot in the old salt sea."
W:
W:"Oh, turn your face away from me
W:To the bright green leaves on the trees;
W:It never shall be said such a villain as you
W:A naked princess did see, see, see,
W:A naked princess did see."
W:
W:He turned his eyes away from her
W:To the bright green leaves on the trees,
W:And she picked him up so strong in her arms
W:And flung him into the sea, sea, sea,
W:And flung him into the sea.
W:
W:"Come help, come help, my pretty fair maid,
W:Forgive and succor me,
W:And I'll yet take thee to fair Scotland
W:And there I'll marry with thee, thee, thee,
W:And there I'll marry with thee."
W:
W:"Lie there, lie there, you false-hearted knave;
W:Lie there in room of me.
W:You'd have stripped me as naked as eter I was born,
W:And I ne'er took a stitch from thee, thee, thee,
W:And I ne'er took a stitch from thee."
W:
W:She mounted on the milk-white steed,
W:And she led the dappled gray,
W:And she rode till she came to her father's house
W:One hour before it was day, day, day,
W:One hour before it was day.
W:
W:Up spoke the old parrot from her cage door,
W:And loudly did she say:
W:"Where've you been, my pretty princess,
W:So long before it is day, day, day,
W:So long before it is day?"
W:
W:"Hush up, hush up, my pretty Polly;
W:Don't tell any tales on me,
W:And your cage shall be lined with a wind-beaten gold
W:Hung on yon willow tree, tree, tree,
W:Hung on yon willow tree."
W:
W:Up spoke the old king from his chamber,
W:From his chamber where he lay:
W:"Who are you calling, my pretty Polly,
W:So long before it is day, day, day,
W:So long before it is day?"
W:
W:"The old cat came to my cage door
W:For to devour me,
W:And I was calling my pretty princess
W:To drive the cat awav, 'way, 'way,
W:To drive the cat away."
