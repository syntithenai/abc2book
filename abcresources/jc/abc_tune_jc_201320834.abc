W:An outlandish knight from the northern land
W:He said he would marry me
W:He said he would take me to the far, far land
W:And there he would wed with me
W:
W:O fetch me some of your father's gold
W:And some of your mother's fee
W:And two of the best of your father's nags
W:That stand by thirty & three
W:
W:Then up & she mounts on her milk white steed
W:And he on his dapple grey
W:They rode till they came to the sea, sea side
W:Three hours before the day
W:
W:Light off, light off thy milk white steed
W:And deliver it unto me
W:For six pretty maids I have drowned here
W:And the seventh thou shalt be
W:
W:Pull off, pull off thy silken gown
W:And deliver it unto me
W:For I reckon it be too fine & gay
W:To rot in the salt, salt sea
W:
W:Pull off, pull off thy silken stays
W:And deliver it unto me
W:For I reckon it be too fine & gay
W:To rot in the salt, salt sea
W:
W:Pull off, pull off thy holland smock
W:And deliver them unto me
W:For I reckon they be too fine & gay
W:To rot in the salt, salt sea
W:
W:If I must pull off my holland smock
W:Pray turn your back on me
W:For it is not fit for a lady like me
W:A naked woman to be
W:
W:If I must pull off my holland smock
W:Pray turn your back on me
W:For it is not fit an outlandish thief
W:A naked me should see
W:
W:O then he turned his back on her
W:And looked upon green tree
W:That she might pull off her holland smock
W:And that her he might not see
W:
W:As he turned his back on the fair lady
W:A viewing the leaves so green
W:Then she caught him about his middle small
W:And thrust him into the stream
W:
W:He dropped high, he dropped low
W:Until he came to the side
W:Catch hold of my hand, my lady dear
W:I'll make thee my lawful bride
W:
W:Lie there, lie there thou false hearted man
W:Lie there instead of me
W:Six pretty maids hast thou drowned here
W:And the seventh hath drowned thee
W:
W:Then up she mounted her milk white steed
W:And she led the dapple grey
W:She rode till she came to her father's house
W:Two hours before the day
W:
W:The parrot was up in the window high
W:And laughed so shrill & did say
W:I'm afraid some ruffian here has been
W:And led my sweet lady away
W:
W:Don't prittle and prattle my pretty parrot
W:Nor tell any tales of me
W:Your cage shall be made of the glittering gold
W:Although it was made of a tree
W:Your cage shall be made of the glittering gold
W:And the door of ivory.
