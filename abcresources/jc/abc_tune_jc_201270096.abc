W:Drink to me only with thine eyes

W:But might I of Jove's nectar sip,
W:I would not change for thine.

W:I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
W:Not so much hon'ring thee.
W:As giving it a hope that there

W:And sent'st it back to me,
W:Since when it grows and smells, I swear
W:Not of itself, but thee.
