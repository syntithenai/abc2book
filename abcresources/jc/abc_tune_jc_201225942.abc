%% You've heard of three pretty maids all
%% in a a row - well, how about three pretty maids all in a house?
%% I've been going to write this tune for years to memorialize the fact that
%% quite a long time ago Nancy Pratt, Sarah Bauhan, and Julie Perron
%% all lived together in the same house over in Harrisville. I don't
%% know why I thought I had to write a tune about this important historical
%% fact - I guess I just liked the title. And I liked all three girls.
%% And I still do!
