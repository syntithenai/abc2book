w:As we may see from the ex-plo-sion That has been at Trim-don Grange*
W:Let's not think of tomorrow,
W:Lest we disappointed be;
W:Our joys may turn to sorrow,
W:As we all may daily see.
W:Today we're strong and healthy,
W:But how soon there comes a change.
W:As we may see from the explosion
W:That has been at Trimdon Grange.
W:
W:Men and boys left home that morning
W:For to earn their daily bread,
W:Little thought before the evening
W:They'd be numbered with the dead;
W:Let us think of Mrs Burnett,
W:Once had sons and now has none -
W:With the Trimdon Grange explosion,
W:Joseph, George and James are gone.
W:
W:February left behind it
W:What will never be forgot;
W:Weeping widows, helpless children
W:May be found in many a cot.
W:Little children kind and loving
W:From their homes each day would run;
W:For to meet their father's coming
W:As each hard day's work was done.
W:
W:Now they ask if father's left them,
W:And the mother hangs her head,
W:With a weeping widow's feelings,
W:Tells the child its father's dead.
W:Homes that once were blessed with comfort
W:Guided by a father's care
W:Now are solemn, sad and gloomy,
W:Since the father is not there.
W:
W:God protect each lonely widow,
W:Help to raise each drooping head;
W:Be a Father to the orphans,
W:Never let them cry for bread.
W:Death will pay us all a visit;
W:They have only gone before.
W:We may meet the Trimdon victims
W:Where explosions are no more.
