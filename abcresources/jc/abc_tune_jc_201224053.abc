%% As they say, "You ain't
%% seen nuthin' yet!" until you've seen the 3 brothers
%% Todd, Scott, and Derek, AKA "Little Buff", all former
%% school boys of mine, along with their dad, Dick Buffum,
%% out on the field playing softball on the same team at the same
%% time. Back in 1989, I saw them come from 10 runs behind to win
%% a championship game in the last 2 innings! They were AWESOME!
