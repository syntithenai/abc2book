%% Have you ever danced in Grafton Center?
%% A lot of people have never even heard of Grafton Center, but that's where great
%% fiddler Skip Gorman lives (actuall, Grafton), and he was trying to get a
%% dance going in a real nice little hall up there. Last night, Mary DesRoisiers
%% called the last dance there in this series; we had a real good time and came
%% home in a snow storm! I thought she needed a sourvenir of the occasion,
%% so here's a tune for you, Mary, with love from MAC.
