W: With a merry little jig and a happy little song
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: We trudge our way the whole day long
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: What though we're covered all over with dust,
W: It's better than staying home to rust
W: We'll reach Salt Lake some day or bust
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W:
W: There's a pretty little girl in the outfit ahead
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: Wish she was by my side instead
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: Look at her now with a pout on her lips,
W: As daintily with her finger tips
W: She picks for the fire some buffalo chips
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W:
W: Oh tonight we'll dance by the light of the moon
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: To the fiddler's best and only tune
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
W: Holding her hand and stealing a kiss
W: Never a step to the dance we miss
W: Never did I know a love like this
W: Whoa Haw Buck and Jerry Boy
