w: Where all my joy and fan-cy lies.
W:Come write me down you powers above,
W:The man that first created love,
W:For I have a jewel all in my eyes,
W:Where all my joy and fancy lies.
W:
W:"I'll give you gold, I'll give you pearl,
W:If you can fancy me, my girl.
W:Such costly robes as you shall wear,
W:If you can fancy me, my dear."
W:
W:"It's not your gold shall me entice
W:To rob me of my virtuous life,
W:For I never do intend at all
W:To be at any young man's call."
W:
W:"Then go, you proud and scornful dame,
W:If you prove false, I'll do the same,
W:For I have no doubt that I shall find,
W:Another young girl to please my mind."
W:
W:"Oh! stay, young man, don't be in haste,
W:You seem afraid your time you'll waste;
W:Let reason rule your roving mind,
W:And unto you I will prove kind."
W:
W:To church they went the very next day,
W:And married were without delay;
W:And now that girl she is his wife,
W:And proves his comfort day and night.
W:
W:So now my roving days are past,
W:My joy and comfort's come at last;
W:For all the pains that ever we know,
W:There's nothing but death shall part us more.
