%% Adam Bluhm lives over in Fitzwilliam, where his dad, fiddler Carey and nice
%% mom Dancy are trying hard to re-establish contra dancing in the beautiiful
%% old hall that Duke Miller called in for so many years. Adam's working at
%% the piano, and perhaps someday before long he'll be backing up his dad
%% while Dancy collects the ticket money!
