%% This tune's for Don and Diane McIntyre of
%% Anchorage, AK and the reason for the #2 is because, when you say it, it
%% sounds just the same as the other one. So it's #2. See? Well, anyway,
%% Don and Diane are old friends; I met Don years ago in Billy McConiskey's
%% button box class at Augusta, and more recently, all three of us, along with
%% some other friends, had the best jam session ever at the Northwest Folklife
%% Festival in Seattle last year. That was such fun! I really love those pictures you
%% guys sent me of us playing together - Thanks ever so much!
