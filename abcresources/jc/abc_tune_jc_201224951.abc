%% Arthur and Jean Tufts of
%% Exeter, NH, could easily have taken the prize for "New
%% Hampshire's Greatest Dance Enthusiasts." They really loved the dance
%% scene during the Ralph Page years, and Arthur got to be a very
%% respectable caller by following Ralph's example. His dear Jean is no
%% longer with us, but I still have the pleasure of seeing Arthur
%% occasionally at various dance functions. Many blessings
%% on you, old friend!
