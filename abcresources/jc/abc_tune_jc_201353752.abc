W:As I was sitting by the fire,
W:                                                      Talking to old Reilly's daughter
W:                                                      Suddenly a thought came into my head:
W:                                                      I'd like to marry old Reilly's daughter,
W:
W:                                                      Chorus
W:                                                      Giddy I Ay, Giddy I Ay, Giddy I Ay
W:                                                      For the one eyed Reilly,
W:                                                      Giddy I Ay, (bang, bang, bang)
W:                                                      Play it on your big brass drum.
W:
W:                                                      For Reilly played on the big brass drum
W:                                                      Reilly had a mind for murder and slaughter,
W:                                                      Reilly had a bright red gilttering eye,
W:                                                      And he kept an eye on his lovely daughter.
W:
W:                                                      Chorus
W:
W:                                                      Her hair was black and her eyes were blue
W:                                                      The colonel and the major and the captain sought her
W:                                                      The sergeant and the private and the drummer boy, too
W:                                                      But they never had a chance with O'Reilly's daughter.
W:
W:                                                      Chorus
W:
W:                                                      I got me a ring and a parson, too,
W:                                                      I got me a 'scratch' in the married quarter
W:                                                      Settled me down to a peaceful life,
W:                                                      As happy as a king with O'Reilly's daughter.
W:
W:                                                      Chorus
W:
W:                                                      Suddenly a footstep on the stair,
W:                                                      Who should it be but the one-eyed Reilly
W:                                                      With two pistols in his hand
W:                                                      Look for the man who married his daughter.
W:
W:                                                      Chorus
W:
W:                                                      I took O'Reilly by the hair,
W:                                                      Rammed his head in a pail of water,
W:                                                      Fired his pistols in the air,
W:                                                      A darned sight quicker than I married his daughter.

W:
W:                                   Sitting in O'Riley's bar one day
W:                                   Drinking whiskey, passing water,
W:                                   Suddenly a thought come to my mind,
W:                                   I'd like to fuck O'Riley's daughter.
W:
W:                                   CHORUS:
W:                                   Giddy-eye-eye, giddy-eye-oh
W:                                   Giddy-eye-eye, for the one-eyed Riley,
W:                                   Rough 'em up, stuff em up, balls and all,
W:                                   Hey jig-a-jig-eye-oh.
W:
W:                                   Her hair was black, her eyes were blue,
W:                                   The Colonel, the Major, and the Captain sought her,
W:                                   The regimental goat and the drummer boy too,
W:                                   But they never had a fuck with O'Riley's daughter.
W:
W:                                   Jack O'Flanagan is my name,
W:                                   I'm the king of copulation,
W:                                   Drinking beer my claim to fame,
W:                                   Fucking women my occupation.
W:
W:                                   Walking through the town one day,
W:                                   Who should I meet but O'Riley's daughter,
W:                                   Never a word to her did say,
W:                                   But "Don't you think we really 'oughter?"
W:
W:                                   Up the stairs and into bed,
W:                                   There I cocked my left leg over,
W:                                   Marianne was smiling then,
W:                                   Smiling still when the fuck was over.
W:
W:                                   Fucked her till her tits were flat,
W:                                   Filled her up with soapy water,
W:                                   She won't get away with that,
W:                                   If she doesn't have twins then she really 'oughter.
W:
W:                                   Suddenly footsteps on the stairs,
W:                                   Old man Riley bent on slaughter,
W:                                   Bloody great pistol in his hand,
W:                                   Looking for the one who fucked his daughter.
W:
W:                                   He fired the pistol at my head,
W:                                   Missed me by an inch and quarter,
W:                                   Hit his daughter Marianne,
W:                                   Right in the place where she passes water.
W:
W:                                   I grabbed O'Riley by the hair,
W:                                   Shoved his head in a bucket of water,
W:                                   Rammed his pistol up his ass,
W:                                   A damn sight quicker than I fucked his daughter.
W:
W:                                   Old man Riley's dead and gone,
W:                                   Shall we bury him? Not fucking likely,
W:                                   We'll nail him to the shithouse door,
W:                                   And there we'll bugger him twice nightly.
W:
W:                                   Come you virgins, maidens fair,
W:                                   Answer me quick and true not slyly.
W:                                   Do you want it straight and square,
W:                                   Or the way I gave it to one eyed Riley?
