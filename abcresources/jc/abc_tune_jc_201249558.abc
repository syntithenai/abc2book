W:The night the Babe was born,
W:A star lit up the sky,
W:The darkness vanished from the earth
W:And songs came from on high,
W:Bringing gifts of myrrh and gold
W:And frankincense from lands a-far.
W:Came wise men of the East,
W:Who journeyed on to Bethlehem
W:Led by the shining star.
W:
W:And on that starry night,
W:A calm fell on the earth.
W:The world at last was filled with love
W:Because Mary gave birth.
W:All the creatures shared the joy
W:And gathered round the oxen stall,
W:Where Jesus laid in peace:
W:A tender, helpless Babe,
W:Yet born a King to save us all.
W:
W:To shepherds in the fields
W:Appeared a glorious light,
W:An angel came and stood before them
W:All glorious in white.
W:Then the angel told the shepherds
W:Of the Truth, the Life, the Way
W:With praise they danced and sang
W:And played upon their pipes,
W:New tunes to celebrate that day.
