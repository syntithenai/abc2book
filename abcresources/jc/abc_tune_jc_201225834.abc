%% In Book 8 it says that Bo
%% Bradham is from North Carolina. Well, that's a big fat lie, whoever
%% wrote that in there! He's from SOUTH Carolina, and the worst of it (as far
%% as we up here are concerned) is that he and Kim have moved back Down
%% South again. I sure miss your fiddling, Bo, and I know this tune isn't
%% all that great, but you can try it and see what you think - Best wishes
%% always to you both - Come back and see us, y'hear?
