w:Who__ ask'd me_ if I had a wife, but_ mar-riage I de-nied.
W:As I went o'er the Highland hills
W:To a farmer's house I came.
W:The night being dark and something wet,
W:I ventured into the same,
W:Where I was kindly treated,
W:And a pretty lass I spied,
W:Who asked me if I had a wife,
W:But marriage I denied.
W:
W:I courted her the lae long night
W:Till near the dawn of day,
W:When frankly she did say to me
W:"Alang with you I'll gae;
W:For Ireland is a fine country,
W:And the Scots to you are kin,
W:So I will gang along with you
W:My fortune to begin."
W:
W:Day being come and breakfast o'er
W:To the parlour I was ta'en;
W:The gudeman kindly asked me
W:If I'd marry his daughter Jane.
W:"Five hundred marks I'll give her
W:Besides a piece of lan';"
W:But scarcely had he spoke the word
W:Till I thought of Peggy Bawn.
W:
W:"Your offer, Sir, is very good,
W:And I thank you too," said I,
W:"But I cannot be your son-in-law,
W:And I'll tell you the reason why:
W:My business calleth me in haste,
W:I am the King's servant bound,
W:And I must gang awa' this day
W:Straight to Edinburgh town."
W:
W:Oh, Peggy Bawn, thou art my own,
W:Thy heart lies in my breast;
W:And though we at a distance are
W:Yet I love thee still the best.
W:Although we at a distance are
W:And the seas between us roar,
W:Yet I'll be constant, Peggy Bawn,
W:To thee for evermore.
