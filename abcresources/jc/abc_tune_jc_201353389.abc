W: I envy no mortal tho' ever so great,
W: Nor scorn I a wretch for his lowly estate;
W: But what I abhor and esteem as a curse,
W: Is poorness of spirit, not poorness of purse.
W: 
W: Then dare to be generous, dauntless, and gay,
W: Let us merrily pass life's remainder away;
W: Upheld by our friends, we our foes may despise,
W: For the more we are envied, the higher we rise.
