%% Is that an Irish title? OK, the turkey has been known in Europe
%% since 1523, but I still doubt that there is any traditional
%% *Irish* song about that bird. It's more likely that the title
%% (though, not necessarily the tune!) is of US origin. It's clear -
%% both from O'Neill and other sources - that Irish immigrants to the
%% USA tended to keep close contact with their native country and that
%% there always was an extensive cultural exchange between Ireland
%% and Irish-American communities.
