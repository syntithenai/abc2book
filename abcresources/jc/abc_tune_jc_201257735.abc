W:        The Bull's Despair
W:
W:        They say I'm a champion bull, sir,
W:        My genes are the best ones to sow,
W:        My brothers all got
W:        The unkindest cut
W:        But with pride I still swing to and fro.
W:
W:        My grandfather told me of his exploits,
W:        Of springtimes the natural way,
W:        He and his mates
W:        Would rush through the gates
W:        And see how many cows they could lay.
W:
W:        Now, I've fathered some thousands of calves, sir,
W:        Yet I've not seen a flesh and blood heifer,
W:        For me, it's a vet
W:        With a latex pipette
W:        In a fibreglass cow, that they proffer.
W:
W:        Darwin showd us behaviour's passed down, sir,
W:        We seek romance to help us beget,
W:        If this practice adheres
W:        For some thousands of years
W:    Bulls will lust for the most dextrous vet!
