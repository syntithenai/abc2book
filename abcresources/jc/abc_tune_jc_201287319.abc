%% The 3 versions are:
%%   0  Basic version based on what several versions had in common.
%%   1  From folx.org, plus chords from a group practice session.
%%   2  Paul Lizotte's handout at a Roaring Jelly practice 2016-12-13.
%%endtext
%%begintext align
%% This is a 32-bar Qu\'ebecois reel
%% that has been transcribed in rather different ways.
%% The reason is that it does something common in "French"
%% music in the second part:
%% The chord changes happen in the middle of measures.
%% This has the effect of shifting the apparent downbeat between the parts.
%% Version 1 shows it as a regular 32-bar reel with two 8-bar parts.
%% Version 2 uses a 6/4 bar to shift the bar lines so that the chord
%% changes happen on the downbeat. This can cause confusion in readers,
%% but matches the "feel" of the tune when the downbeats are stressed.
%%endtext
%%begintext align
%% Version 1 has somewhat complex chords, so the shifted
%% stress in its second part isn't apparent on paper. If you omit
%% the "unnecessary" Em chords and the A7 chords that follow plain
%% A chords, the mid-bar chord changes become more visible.
%% Changing the A7 chords in bars 2 and 5 to the D chords
%% (as in the second version) will add to the effect.
%% Version 2 makes the downbeat-shift effect clearer but for some people
%% it produces confusion at the ends of the parts.
%% French musicians often stress the beats equally,
%% and for that style either version will work.
