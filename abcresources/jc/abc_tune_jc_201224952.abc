%% Edinburgh, Scotland is a wonderful
%% part of the world, perhaps especially so if the visitor from a
%% foreign land has a particular interest n traditional music.
%% Three of us went there in late summer '92, and Aly Bain treated us
%% like we were royalty. Thanks ever so much for your great hospitality,
%% Aly; we surely enjoyed being at Balmoral Place. Best
%% wishes always to you and the Boys -- we hope to see you soon.
