%% This tune is for a young
%% man named Spencer Nelson, who will probably
%% never hear it, but for the rest of the story you'll just
%% have to ask Frank and Dina Blad3. I will tell you that
%% you always get a wonderful dinner (what a treat!) at the
%% Space Needle Restaurant in Seattle, which is where we met Spencer.
