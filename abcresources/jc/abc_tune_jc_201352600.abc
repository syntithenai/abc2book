 ED |C2 FA c2 BG | F6  |]
w:Till she come to her fath-er's own door
W:It was on a cold, dark winter's night,
W:As th' wind blew across th' wild moor;
W:Poor Mary come wanderin' home with her child,
W:Till she come to her father's own door.
W:
W:"Oh, why did I ever leave this spot
W:Where once I was happy an' free?
W:I am now doomed to roam with no freedom or home,
W:An' none to take pity on me.
W:
W:"Oh father, dear father," she cried,
W:"Do come down an' open the door,
W:For the child in my arms will perish an' die
W:From the wind that blows 'cross the wild moor."
W:
W:But the old man was deaf to her cries,
W:Not a sound of her voice did he hear;
W:An' the watchdog did howl an' the village bell tolled,
W:An' the wind blew across the wild moor.
W:
W:Oh, how must that old man have felt,
W:When he opened the door in the morn;
W:He found Mary dead, but the child alive
W:Closely clasped in its dead mother's arms.
W:
W:The old man with grief pined away,
W:An' the child to its mother soon went;
W:An' no-one, they say, has lived there to this day,
W:An' the cottage has fallen to ruin.
W:
W:The villagers point out the spot
W:Where the willow droop over the door,
W:Sayin', "There Mary died, once the gay cillage bride,"
W:An' the wind still blows 'cross the wild moor.
