%% Up in Crafton, NH, there's a nice young
%% woman named Susan Gorman. The happens to be the wife of a very fine fiddler
%% names Skip Gorman who, coincidentally, also lives in Crafton. I've only
%% gotten to know Susan recently while I was playing with Skip for his
%% nice little dance in Grafton Center, but there was no question in my
%% mind that she deserved a tune of her own for helping with the dance.
%% So here it is, Susan, and I hope you like it - Perhaps Skip will play it for
%% you on his fiddle. (He'd better, or I'll smack him!)
