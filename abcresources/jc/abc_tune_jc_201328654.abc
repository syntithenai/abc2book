W:Beside a hill there is a still,
W:Where the smoke runs up to the sky;
W:You can always tell by the whiff and the smell
W:That the liquor boys are nigh.
W:
W:That the liquor boys are nigh,
W:That the liquor boys are nigh,
W:You can always tell by the whiff and the smell,
W:That the liquor boys are nigh.

W:This mountain dew is made from grain,
W:And mixed with water pure,
W:And the alcohol that it contains
W:Will all your troubles cure.
W:
W:Will all your troubles cure ...
W:
W:Al learned men who use the pen
W:Have writ its praises high;
W:It fills the air with perfume rare
W:Distilled with wheat and rye.
W:
W:Distilled with wheat and rye ...

W:Away with pills, 'twill cure the ills
W:Of Pagan, Christian and Jew,
W:Off with your coat and wet your throat
W:With the real old mountain dew.
W:
W:With the real old mountain dew ...
W:
W:So before we roll won't you have another bowl
W:Of the good old mountain dew?
W:Of the good old mountain dew?
W:Of the good old mountain dew?
W:
W:Of the good old mountain dew? ...
