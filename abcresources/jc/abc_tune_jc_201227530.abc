W: 2. Soft Eccho listen'd to the Tune, 
W: And quick to Phoebe bore the sound; 
W: Which soon as heard she instant knew, 
W: And smiling sought the enchanting Ground. 
W: No sooner did the Nymph appear. 
W: Than rapture fill'd Palemon's breast; 
W: He rose and on her modest Cheek, 
W: The Kiss of rapture fondly prest.

W: 3. The varying blush her Fate o'erspread, 
W: As Lillies damask'd by the Rose; 
W: While gentle tumults in each Breast, 
W: Their mutual Love in sighs disclose. 
W: When sudden open'd to their view, 
W: Beneath the branches of an Oak; 
W: A Village spire with Ivy drest, 
W: And thus Palemon spoke. 
W: 
W: 4. Twelve moons my Love are gone and o'er, 
W: Since first my youthfull heart you won; 
W: Then haste my fair to yonder spire, 
W: And there unite our vows in one. 
W: Together hied the rustic Pair, 
W: With constancy their only wealth;
W: Nor wish'd for more while thus possess'd, 
W: Of Love, their Cot, and rosy health.
