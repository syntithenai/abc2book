W:
W:There was a proper tall young man,
W:And William was his name;
W:He came away over the raging sea,
W:He came a-courting me, O me,
W:He came a-courting me.
W:
W:He followed me up, he followed me down,
W:He followed me in my room.
W:I had no wings for to fly away,
W:No tongue to say him nay.
W:
W:He took part of my father's gold,
W:Half of my mother's fee;
W:He took two of my father's stable steeds,
W:For there stood thirty and three.
W:
W:The lady rode the milk-white steed,
W:The gentleman rode the grey.
W:They rode all down by the north green land
W:All on one sumrner's day.
W:
W:Light off, light off, my pretty fair miss,
W:I tell you now my mind.
W:Six pretty fair maids I've drownded here,
W:The seventh one you shall be.
W:
W:Hush up, hush up, you old vilyun,
W:That hain't what you promised me.
W:You promised to carry me over the raging sea,
W:And then for to marry me.
W:
W:Turn your back and trim those nettles
W:That grow so near the brim;
W:They'll tangle in my golden hair
W:And tear my lily-white skin.
W:
W:He turned his back to trim those nettles
W:That growed so near the brim
W:This young lady with her skilfulness
W:She tripped her false love in.
W:
W:Lie there, lie there, you old vilyun,
W:Lie there in the place for me.
W:You have nothing so fine nor costly
W:But to rot in the salt water sea.
W:
W:First she rode the milk-white steed
W:And then she rode the grey.
W:She returned back to her father's house
W:Three long hours before it was day.
