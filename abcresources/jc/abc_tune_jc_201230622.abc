%% Cindy and Bob Porter
%% raise beef cattle on their "Hilltop Farm" in
%% Claremont. They're lovely folks, and it's always
%% such a treat when some of their Hilltop Steaks land
%% on your plate. Yummy stuff! And besides that, they
%% have a real sweet fiddle-playing daughter named 'Sarah'
%% that I like a lot. Hi Sarah! :-)
