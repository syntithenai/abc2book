w:And she_ a-lone was his heart's de-light.
W:It's of a farmer all in this town,
W:His name was up through the country round;
W:He had a daughter, a beauty bright,
W:And she alone was his heart's delight.
W:
W:Many a noble lord came this dame to see,
W:But still she could fancy none of these;
W:But of late came one of low degree,
W:He came of late, so she fancied he.
W:
W:When her father came of this to hear,
W:He separated her from her dear;
W:Three score miles he did her send
W:To her uncle's house, to her discontent.
W:
W:One night as she was for her bed bound,
W:She heard a noise and a {dismal/deadly} sound;
W:Saying "Mary dear, rise from your bed
W:[I've come, at last, so we can wed."]
W:
W:"Here is a token, my heart's delight
W:Your father's steed to ride home this night;
W:Another token I've brought to you,
W:Your mother's cloak, and her silk coat too."
W:
W:They rode more quickly than the wind,
W:But still he minded his love behind.
W:He heaved a sigh, and thus did say,
W:"O my dearest dear, how my head does ache."
W:
W:Until they came to her father's gate,
W:And there few words to his love did say,
W:"Alight, my love, and go to your bed,
W:Your father's steed I'll see combed and fed."
W:
W:A white holland handkerchief she drew
W:And bound it round his head, and tightly too
W:She went up to her father's hall
W:Loudly for her father she did call.
W:
W:"O father dear, did you send for me,
W:By my loved Jimmy, kind sir?" said she;
W:It's well he knew this young man was dead,
W:Which made every hair stand up on his head.
W:
W:This young man's darling cried more and more,
W:The young man was dead just nine months and more;
W:The grave was opened, where he was laid,
W:With his love's holland handkerchief bound round his head.
