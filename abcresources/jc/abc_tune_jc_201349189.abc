w:As_ she_ lay a-sleep, sleep, sleep, As_ she lay a-sleep-_ ing__ all a-lone.
W:As I rode over yonder forest green
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:There I saw Venus, that most lovely queen
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:It was fair Venus whom there I did espy
W:As she lay asleep, sleep, sleep,
W:As she lay a-sleeping all alone.
W:
W:I asked her, far Venus, for one kiss,
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:How could she deny me of such a happy bliss?
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:Then young Adonis he hung down his head,
W:When she answered him, "No! no! no!"
W:When she answered him, "No! I can't love you!"
W:
W:Than as brisk as the day from me did flee
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:"O stay, Venus, stay, I will tell unto thee,
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:"O stay, Venus, stay, I will tell unto thee,
W:I would tell unto thee, thee, thee,
W:I would tell unto thee the fond tales of love."
W:
W:"Now, young Adonis, you've fairly won my heart
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:And I from you, love, never more will part,
W:(With my hey down derry, with my hey down dey)
W:And I from you, love, never more will part,
W:Nor ever will I change, change, change,
W:Nor ever will I change old love for new!"
