W:It fell upon a day and a bonnie summer day,
W:When the clans were awa' wi' Charlie,
W:For there arose a great dispute
W:Between Argyll and Airlie.
W:
W:The Duke o' Montrose has ridden fast and hard,
W:To reach Dunkeld in the morning,
W:To lead in his troops by the back o' Dunkeld,
W:To plunder the bonnie hoose o' Airlee.
W:
W:Lady Ogilvie she looked fae her high castle wa',
W:O, but she sighed sairly
W:To see false Argyll and hundreds o' his men
W:Come the plunder the boonie hoose o' Airlie.
W:
W:"Come doon, come doon, Lady Ogilvie," he said,
W:"Come doon and kiss me fairly."
W:"I wadna kiss ye, ye false Argyll
W:Though ye wadna leave a stannin' stane in Airlie.
W:
W:"O, I have reared seven bonnie sons,
W:The eighth ne'er seen his daddy;
W:But if I wad hae as mony ower again
W:They would a' gang and fecht for Charlie."
W:
W:He took her by the middle sma',
W:Throwed her on the banks o' Airlie,
W:O it's tell me, Lady Ogilvie,
W:Where is your dowry?
W:
W:Its up and doon and doon and up
W:It lies in the bowlin' green of Airlie.
W:For they socht it up and they socht it doon,
W:They socht it late and early,
W:And they found it below a bonnie balm tree
W:That spead ower the bowlin' greens o' Airlie.
W:
W:If my guid lord had been at hame,
W:As this nicht he's awa' wi' Charlie,
W:There's nae Campbells in a' the land,
W:Wad have burned the bonnie hoose o' AIrlie.
