%% The two men take hands and fall back, and turn single; the women do the same: Hands a-cross half
%% round, and turn single. The second couple being in the first place, cast off, and the other couple follow
%% and lead up a-breast, the first couple cross over into the second couples place, the second couple lead up
%% and cross over into their own places.
