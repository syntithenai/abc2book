%% FINGAL is the great Scottish
%% giant who lives in a huge cave on the island of Staffa, a short
%% distance from the Isle of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland in
%% the group of islands called the Hebrides. Sue and Iain Bain and Sarah
%% Bauhan and I stopped by to see him one day in Sept 89; he was not at
%% home in his cave; we were told this was his day to chase the sea monsters
%% and mermaids away from his waters. We played some tunes in his cave and
%% then left the way we had come, on Iain Morrison's boat. We saw a mermaid on
%% the way home!
