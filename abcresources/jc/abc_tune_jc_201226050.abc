%% I've known Ralph
%% Jones for years. He's Treasurer of the New England
%% Folk Festival Association, and he plays great flute with
%% Sylvia Miskoe, Cal Howard, and others, in "White Cockade".
%% I'm real glad you finally have one of these little tunes, Ralph.
%% Hope it sounds OK on your flute -
