%% To tell about the Gotts, Peter and Polly, of Marshall, 
%% NC, would take almost this whole page and leave no room for the tune! But they
%% are old friends of many years, going back to happy times at Augusta where
%% Peter taught log cabin construction. They have a beautiful Peter-built cabin
%% in the Adirondacks, full of pretty paingings by Polly; it's called Snowbird Camp,
%% and once in a blue moon I got to go there and play a dance with these
%% dear people. I'm sure looking forward to our next get-together! [smiley face]
