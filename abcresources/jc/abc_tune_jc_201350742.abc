w:two,[ext] and both shall cross,[ext] my true love and I.
W:
W:I leaned back against an oak,
W:Thinking it was a mighty tree,
W:But first it bent and then it broke,
W:So did my love prove false to me.
W:
W:I put my hand on some soft bush,
W:Thinking the sweetest flower to find,
W:I pricked my finger to the bone,
W:And keft the sweetest flower behind.
W:
W:Oh, love is handsome and love is kind,
W:Gay as a jewel when it's new,
W:But love grows old and waxes cold,
W:And fades away like morning dew.
W:
W:The water is wide...
