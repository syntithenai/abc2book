%% We think we're
%% real lucky if we get to play music with Bill
%% Tomczak at the New England Folk Festival each
%% year. He's a great friend, and a superb clarinette
%% player. What a joy it is to know you, Bill --

%% One time, at the Girl Scout House in Concord, MA., Ralph Page got Bill T., Bill Possi, and Rich Blagy
%% to play one of his tunes that he had written out a 3-part clarinette version for. Three great
%% clarinette players! Now I'm gonna tell you - THAT was remarkable to a degree beyond calculation!!
