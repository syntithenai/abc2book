W:A bonny Scotch laddie was riding one day,
W:He chanced to meet Molly all on the highway.
W:He tipped her the wink and she rolled her dark eye.
W:Thinks he to himself I'll be with you by and by.

W:And sing fal the diddle i-do, fal the dal day.

W:Here's fifty bright guineas if you will comply
W:One night in my bedchamber with me to lie.
W:With the sight of the money she soon gave consent
W:And into his bedchamber quickly she went.
W:
W:With hugging and kissing she lulled him to sleep
W:And out of his bedchamber softly did creep.
W:Gold rings and bright jewels and diamonds and gold,
W:She robbed this young lord of a fine sum all told.
W:
W:He saddled his horse and away he did ride
W:Thinking to meet Molly down by the sea-side.
W:Three times he passed by her but did not her know.
W:She laughed in her sleeve and said: There goes my beau.
W:
W:So now pretty Molly she lives on the shore,
W:She never will go out a-courting any more,
W:Unless some young sailor should be greatly in want
W:For the loss of old England shall never want salt(--?)
