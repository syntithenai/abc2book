W:Now summer time is coming, boys,
W:What pleasure we should see
W:The small birds are a-whistling
W:On every green tree.
W:The backbirds and the thrushes O
W:Are whistling in the grove.
W:
W:Now Michaelmas is coming, boys,
W:What pleasure we shall find,
W:We'll make the gold and silver fly
W:Like chaff before the wind
W:Then every lad shall take his lass
W:And set her on his knee.
