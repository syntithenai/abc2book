w:San-ti-a-na gained_ the_ day All a-cross the Plains of Mex-i-co!
W:Oh, Santiana gained the day,
W:(Chorus: Away Santiana!)
W:Santiana gained the day,
W:(Chorus: All across the Plains of Mexico!)
W:
W:He gained the day at Molley-del-rey [Monterey]
W:General Taylor ran away.
W:
W:All of his men were brave an' true,
W:Every soldier brave an' true.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana fought for fame,
W:An' Santiana gained a name.
W:
W:An' Zacharias Taylor ran away,
W:He ran away at Molley-del-ray.
W:
W:Santiana's men were brave,
W:Many found a soldier's [hero's] grave.
W:
W:'Twas a fierce an' bitter strife,
W:Hand to hand they fought for life.
W:
W:An' Santiana's name is known,
W:What a man can do was shown.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana fought for his gold
W:What deeds he did have oft been told.
W:
W:'Twas on the field of Molley-del-rey,
W:Santiana lost a leg that day.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana's day is o'er,
W:Santiana will fight no more.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana's gone away,
W:Far from the fields of Molley-del-rey.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana's dead an' gone,
W:An' all the fightin' has bin done.
W:
W:Santiana was a damn fine man,
W:Till he fouled hawse with Old Uncle Sam.
W:
W:Now Santiana shovels his gold,
W:Around Cape Horn in the ice an' cold.
W:
W:We'll dig his grave with a silver spade,
W:An' mark the spot where he was laid.
W:
W:Oh, Santiana now we mourn,
W:We left him buried off Cape Horn.
W:
W:We left him deep 'way off Cape Horn,
W:Close by the place where he was born.
