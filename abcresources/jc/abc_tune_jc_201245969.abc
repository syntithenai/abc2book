W:It's all for me beer and tobacco,

W:Far across the western ocean I must wander.

W:They're all gone for beer and tobacco,
W:For the heels they are worn out and the toes are kicked about
W:And the soles are looking out for better weather.

W:It's all gone for beer and tobacco,
W:For the collar is all worn, and the sleeves they are all torn,
W:And the tail is looking out for better weather.

W:
W:3. I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed,
W:Since first I came ashore from me slumber,
W:For I spent all me dough on the lassies don't you know,
W:Far across the western ocean I must wander.
W:(Chorus)
