W:From this valley they say you are going
W:I will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile,
W:For they say you are taking the sunshine
W:That brightened our pathway a while.
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side is you love me
W:  Do not hasten to bid me adieu.
W:  But remember the Red River Valley
W:  and the girl that has loved you so true.
W:
W:I have promised you, darling, that never
W:Shall the words from my lips cause you pain,
W:And I swear I will love you forever
W:If you only will love me again.
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side...
W:
W:I've been thinking a long time, my darling,
W:of the sweet words you never would say.
W:Now alas! must the found hopes all vanish?
W:For they say you are going away.
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side...
W:
W:When you think of the valley you're leaving?
W:O, how lonely, how sad it will be.
W:When you think of the fond heart you're breaking
W:and the grief you are causing to me!
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side...
W:
W:From this valley you say you are going,
W:when you go, may your darling go to?
W:Would you leave her behind unprotected,
W:when she loves no other but you.
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side...
W:
W:As you go to your home by the ocean,
W:may you never forget those sweey hours,
W:that we spent in the Red River Valley,
W:and the love we exchanged 'nd the flow'rs.
W:
W:  Come and sit by my side...
