W:   Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly,
W:   Blow the wind south o'er the bonny blue sea;
W:   Blow the wind southerly, southerly, southerly,
W:   Blow bonnie breeze, my lover to me.

W:   They told me last night, there were ships in the offing,
W:   And I hurried down to the deep rolling sea,
W:   But my eye could not see it wherever might be it
W:   The bark that is bearing my lover to me.

W:Version from Northumbrian Minstrelsy:
W:   Blaw the wind southerly, southerly, southerly,
W:   Blaw the wind southerly, south or south-west;
W:   My lad's at the bar, at the bar, at the bar
W:   My lad's at the bar whom I love best
W:   A variation of the last two lines is also given
W:   Blaw the lad ti' the bar, ti' the bar, ti' the bar
W:   Blaw the lad ti' the bar that I love best
