W:The lark in the morn as she rises from her nest
W:Mounts thro' the white air, with the dew on her breast,
W:'Long with the pretty ploughboy, she'll whistle and she'll sing,

W:One morning she mounted so cherrily on high,
W:She look'd round about her and at the dark sky,
W:And loudly she was singing and twittering her lay,
W:There's no life like the ploughboy's in the sweet month of May.
W:There's no life, etc.
W:
W:When the day's work is ended and over, he'll go
W:To fair or to market to buy him a bow,
W:And whistle as he walks, O! and shrilly too will sing,
W:There's no life like the ploughboy's all in merry spring.
W:There's no life like the ploughboy's in the sweet month of May.
W:There's no life, etc.
W:
W:Good luck to the ploughboy wherever he may be,
W:A fair pretty maiden he'll take on his knee,
W:He'll drink the nut-brown ale, and this song the lad will sing,
W:Oh! the ploughboy is happier than noble or king.
W:Oh! the ploughboy etc.
