N: The grace notes in bar 11 appear to have dots below the note heads, whatever that means.
N: The 2nd and 4th strains have no repeat signs, but have 1st and 2nd endings; repeats added to match.
N: Bar 21 is repeated, which makes little musical sense, so I left out the 2nd copy. Repeat it if you like.
