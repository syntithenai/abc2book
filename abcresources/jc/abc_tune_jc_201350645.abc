W:(Chorus)
W:If it wasna for the weavers what would we do?
W:We wouldna ha'e claith made o' oor woo',
W:We wouldna ha'e a coat, neither black nor blue,
W:Gin it wasna for the wark o' the weavers.
W:
W:The hireman chiels the mock us and crack aye aboot 's,
W:They say that we are thin-faced, bleached like cloots,
W:But yet for a' their mockery the canna do withoot 's
W:Na! They canna want the wark o' the weavers.
W:
W:There's oor wrichts and oor slaters and glaziers and a'
W:Oor doctors and oor ministers and them that lives by law.
W:And oor friends in South Americay, though them we never saw
W:But we ken they know the wark o' the weavers.
W:
W:There's oor sailors and oor sodjers, we ken they're a' bauld,
W:But if they hadna claithes, faith, they couldna fecht for cauld;
W:The high, the low, the rich, the puir, a' body young and auld,
W:They winna want the wark o' the weavers.
W:
W:There's folk that's independent o' other tradesmen's wark,
W:The women need nae barbers and the dyker needs nae clerk;
W:But nane o' them can dae withoot a coat or a sark,
W:Na! They canna want the wark o' the weavers.
W:
W:The weaving is a trade that never can fail,
W:As lang's we need ae cloot to keep anither hale;
W:So let us aye be merry ower a bicker o' guid ale,
W:And drink tae the wark o' the weavers.
