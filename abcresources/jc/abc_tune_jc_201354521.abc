W:There's a yellow rose in Texas that I am going to see,
W:No other soldier knows her, no soldier only me;
W:She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart
W:And if I ever find her, we never more will part.
W:
W:Cho: She's the sweetest rose of color this soldier ever knew,
W:     Her eyes are bright like diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
W:     You may talk about your dearest May and sing of Rosa Lee,
W:     But the Yellow Rose of Texas is the only girl for me.
W:
W:When  the  Rio Grande is flowing, and the starry skies are bright
W:She walks along the river in the quiet summer night
W:She thinks if I remember, when we parted long ago,
W:I promised to come back again and not to leave her so
W:
W:Oh, now I'm going to find her, for my heart is full of woe
W:And we'll sing the song together, that we sang so long ago
W:We'll play the banjo gaily, and we'll sing the songs of yore,
W:And the Yellow Rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore.
