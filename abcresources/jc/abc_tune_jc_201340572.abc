%:1.
%:  Near to Banbridge Town in the County Down,
%:  One morning in July,
%:  Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen
%:  And she smiled as she passed me by
%:  Oh she looked so neat from her two bare feet
%:  To the sheen of her nut brown hair,
%:  Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
%:  For to see I was really there

W:Chorus:
W:  Oh, from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay      And from Galway to Dublin Town,
W:  No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen  That I met in the County Down.
W:2.
W:  As she onward sped, I shook my head,                And I gazed with a feelin' rare,
W:  And I said, say's I, to a passer-by                "Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?"
W:  Oh he smiled at me and with pride says he          "That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
W:  It's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann, She's the star of the County Down."
W:3.
W:  I've travelled a bit, but never was hit    Since my roving career began
W:  But fair and square I surrendered there    To the charms of young Rose McCann.
W:  I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet       Did I meet with in shawl or gown
W:  But in she went and I asked no rent        From the star of the County Down.
W:4.
W:  She'd a soft brown eye and a look so sly,                And a smile like the rose in June.
W:  And you hung on each note from her lily-white throat     As she lilted an Irish tune.
W:  At the pattern dance you were held in a trance           As she tripped through a reel or a jig;
W:  And when her eyes she'd roll, she'd coax, upon my soul,  A spud from a hungry pig.
W:5.
W:  At the Crossroads Fair I'll be surely there           And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
W:  With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right    For a smile from my nut brown rose.
W:  No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke                Till my plough turns rust coloured brown,
W:  Till a smiling bride by my own fireside               Sits the star of the County Down.
