W:1.~I've heard about this baby boy      Who's come to earth to bring us joy
W:   And I just want to sing this song to you      It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W:   The minor fall, the major lift      With every breath I'm singing Hallelujah
W:          Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W:
W:3.~A couple came to Bethlehem      Expecting child, they searched the inn
W:   To find a place for You were coming soon      There was no room for them to stay
W:   So in a manger filled with hay      God's only Son was born, oh Hallelujah
W:          Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W:
W:3.~The shepherds left their flocks by night      To see this baby wrapped in light
W:   A host of angels led them all to You      It was just as the angels said
W:   You'll find Him in a manger bed      Immanuel and Savior, Hallelujah
W:          Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W:
W:4.~A star shown bright up in the east      To Bethlehem, the wisemen three
W:   Came many miles and journeyed long for You      And to the place at which You were
W:   Their frankincense and gold and myrrh      They gave to You and cried out Hallelujah
W:          Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W:
W:5.~I know You came to rescue me      This baby boy would grow to be
W:   A man and one day die for me and you      My sins would drive the nails in You
W:   That rugged cross was my cross, too      Still every breath You drew was Hallelujah
W:          Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah (repeat)
