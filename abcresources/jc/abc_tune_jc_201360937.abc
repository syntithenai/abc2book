w:1What a friend we have in Je-sus, All our sins and griefs to bear!__
w:2Have we tri-als and temp-ta-tions? Is there trou-ble a-ny-where?__
w:3Are we weak and hea-vy la-den, cum-bered with a load of care?__
w:4Bless-ed Sav-ior, Thou hast prom-ised Thou wilt all our bur-dens bear.__

w:What a priv-i-lege to car-ry, Ev-'ry thing to God in prayer!__
w:We should ne-ver be dis-cour-aged; take it to the Lord in prayer.__
w:Pre-cious Sav-ior, still our re-fuge, take it to the Lord in prayer.__
w:May we ev-er, Lord, be bring-ing all to Thee in earn-est prayer.__
|"A"E3 D EFGE|"D"F4 A2 z2|"G"B3 B "D"AFGF|"A"E2- "E"E2- "A"E2 z2
w:O what peace we of-ten for-feit. O what need-less pain we bear.__
w:Can we find a friend so faith-ful who will all our sor-rows share?__
w:Do your friends des-pise, for-sake you? Take it to the Lord in prayer!__
w:Soon in glo-ry bright un-cloud-ed there will be no need for prayer.__
|"D"A3 A "D7"BAFD|"G"D4 "G#dim"B,2 z2
w:All be-cause we do not car-ry
w:Je-sus knows our ev-ery weak-ness;
w:In His arms He'll take and shield you;
w:Rap-ture, praise and end-less wor-ship
|"D/A"A,3 D "A7"FEDC|"D"D2- "G"D2- "D"D2 z2||
w:ev-'ry-thing to God in prayer.__
w:take it to the Lord in prayer.__
w:you will find a so-lace there.__
w:will be our sweet por-tion there.__
