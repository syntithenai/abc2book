w:The_ lit-tle Lord Je-sus a-sleep_ on the hay
W: Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,
W:The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head;
W:The stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay,
W:The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.
W:
W:The cattle are lowing the baby awakes,
W:But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes:
W:I love thee, Lord Jesus; look down from the sky,
W:And stay by my side until morning is nigh.
W:
W:Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask thee to stay
W:Close by me for ever, and love me, I pray;
W:Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,
W:And fit us for heaven to live with thee there.
