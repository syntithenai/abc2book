w:Will-iam Tay-lor was a brisk_ young sail-or, He who court-ed a la-dy fair;
d3 d d2 B2 |A2 G2 F2 D2 |G2 B2 =c2 A2 |G2 E2 D4 |]
w:Bells were ring-ing, sail-ors sing-ing, As to church they did re-pair
W:William Taylor was a brisk young sailor
W:He who courted a lady fair
W:Bells were ringing, sailors were singing
W:As to church they did repair.
W:
W:Thirty couples at the wedding;
W:All were dress'd in rich array;
W:'Stead of William being married
W:He was press'd and sent away.
W:
W:She dress'd up in man's apparel
W:Man's apparel she put on
W:And she follow'd her true lover;
W:For to find him she is gone.
W:
W:Then the Captain stepp'd up to her
W:Asking her: What's brought you here?
W:I am come to seek my true love
W:Whom I lately loved so dear.
W:
W:If you've come to see your true love,
W:Tell me what his name may be
W:O, his name is William Taylor
W:From the Irish ranks came he.
W:
W:You rise early tomorrow morning
W:You rise at the break of day;
W:There you'll see your true love William
W:Walking with a lady gay.
W:
W:She rose early the very next morning;
W:She rose up at break of day;
W:There she saw her true love William
W:Walking with a lady gay.
W:
W:Sword and pistol she then order'd
W:To be brought at her command;
W:And she shot her true love William
W:With the bride on his right arm.
W:If young folks in Wells or London
W:Were served the same as she served he,
W:Then young girls would all be undone
W:Very scarce would young men be.
