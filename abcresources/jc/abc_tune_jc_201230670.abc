%% Seattle-ite Wendy Whittemore
%% started life up in Dublin, MH where I used to live, and I've
%% known her for years. Her mom used to go to contra dances
%% with their pet mini-horse in the back of a micro-bus
%% (not to dance with, 'tho!) Wendy's one of the wonderful
%% singers in that great Seattle group, the "S-Curves",
%% and boy, can they sing! Lucky me gets to hear
%% them at Folklife every year! Fantabulous!!
