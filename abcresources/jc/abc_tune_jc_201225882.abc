%% Francis Orzechowski lives
%% up in Newport with his nice family - at 10 yrs old he's Jane and
%% Peter's oldest, and he's a real nice kid; he's always thoughtful and
%% courteous whenever I go up there for our "Old New England" rehearsals. He's
%% a big help to his folks with the younger ones, and don't you think he ought
%% to have this hornpipe? I thought that's what you'd say! I hope you
%% think so, too, Francis!! :-)
