w:The ro-sy kir-tled_ dawn_ ap-*pears To_ kiss a-way_ night's_ hea-vy tears.
W:Awake, ye drowsy maids, awake,
W:Behold the beausteous morning break;
W:The rosy kirtled dawn appears
W:To kiss away night's heavy tears.
W:
W:The lark is thrilling in the height,
W:A voice and not a speck in sight,
W:The blackbirds brooding o'er their nests,
W:Instruct their young from tuneful breasts.
W:
W:Already Roger with his crook
W:Attends his flock at yonder brook,
W:And blushing Betty at his side,
W:For sure by June will be his bride.
W:
W:Already lowing in the stall
W:The cows from you attention call;
W:Ope, ope, ye maids, your honest eyes,
W:The stars viel theirs in paling skies.
W:
W:Ye wretched sluggards in your beds,
W:With parched thraots and aching heads,
W:What rapture and frersh charms ye miss
W:Who lose the sun's arising kiss.
W:
W:Awake, ye drowsly maids, awake,
W:The cobwebs from your fancies shake;
W:We lads without, our feet in dew,
W:Are calling, with the cows, for you.
