T: 66. OVER THE STUMP AND BACK AGAIN
B: Sam Bayard, "Hill Country Tunes" 1944 #66
S: Played by Mrs Sarah Armstrong, (near) Derry, PA, Nov 18, 1943.
N: The story Mrs Armstrong tells concerning this tune illustrates the extremely casual  way
N: in  which a country dance tune can acquire a new name.  On one occasion, when the player
N: was a small girl, her uncle Laney Gray was sitting n their home playing this tune on his
N: fiddle. Someone came into the house with the news that old Dan Riffle (a local character
N: still well remembered by many people in the Derry neighborhood) was trying  to  drive  a
N: team  back  and  forth  across a stump.  The team was reluctant, and Dan was yelling and
N: swearing at the animals in a great passion.  When Laney heard this, he at once exclamed,
N: "There's  a  name for my tune -- `Over the stump and back again!'" Mrs Armstrong did not
N: state that her uncle had composed thi air; in all  likelihood,  he  was  merely  casting
N: about for some suitable name to give to it, and this little incident inspired him!
