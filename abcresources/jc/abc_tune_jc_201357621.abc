W:2. From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came.
W:And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same,
W:How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name:
W:O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
W:O tidings of comfort and joy.
W:
W:3. The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
W:And left their flocks a-feeding, in tempest, storm, and wind,
W:And went to Bethlehem straightway this blessed babe to find:
W:O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
W:O tidings of comfort and joy.
W:
W:4. But when to Bethlehem they came, whereat this infant lay
W:They found him in a manger, where oxen feed on hay;
W:His mother Mary kneeling, unto the Lord did pray:
W:O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
W:O tidings of comfort and joy.
W:
W:5. Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place,
W:And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
W:This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface:
W:O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
W:O tidings of comfort and joy.
