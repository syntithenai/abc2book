W:I was homeward bound one night on the deep,
W:Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep.
W:I dreamed a dream, and I thought it true
W:concerning Franklin and his gallant crew.
W:
W:With a hundred seamen he sailed away
W:to the frozen ocean in the month of May
W:to seek a passage around the Pole
W:where the poor seamen do sometimes go.
W:
W:Through cruel hardships they manly strove.
W:Their ships on mountains of ice was drove.
W:Only the Eskimo with his skin canoe
W:was the only one to ever come through.
W:
W:In Baffin Bay where the whale fishes blow,
W:the fate of Franklin no man may know.
W:The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell,
W:Lord Franklin along with his sailors dwell.
W:
W:And now my burden it gives me pain.
W:For my lost Franklin I would cross the main,
W:Ten thousand pounds would I freely give
W:to say on earth that my Franklin do live.
