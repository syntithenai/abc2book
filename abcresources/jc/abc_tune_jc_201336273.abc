w:As I and my Flo-ra, my Flo-ra, fair Flo-ra so great?
W:I'll spread the green branches although I am young;
W:So well do I live my love, so sweetly she sung;
W:Was there ever man in so happy a state
W:As I and my Flora, my Flora, fair Flora so great?
W:
W:I will go to my Flora, and to her I'll say,
W:"We both will be married, it wants but one day,"
W:"One day!" says this fair one, "One day is to come!
W:To be married so early, so early, my age is too young."
W:
W:"I will first go to service, and when I return
W:We both will be married all in the next town."
W:"Will you first go to service, and leave me to cry?"
W:"Yes, lovely shepherds, yes shepherd, I have told you for why."
W:
W:As it happened, to service, she went,
W:To wait on a lady, as was her intent;
W:For to wait on a lady, a rich lady gay,
W:Who cloth-ed young Flora, young Flora, in costly array.
W:
W:In twelvemonth, or better, a letter I sent,
W:Three or four lines for to know her intent;
W:She wrote that she lived a contented life,
W:But that she never, she never could be a poor shepherd's wife.
W:
W:These words and experience they pierced like a dart,
W:But I'll pluck up my spirits, and cheer up my heart;
W:By hoping that thus she may write nevermore,
W:But let me convince her, convince her, as ofttimes before.
W:
W:Now my ewes and my lambs I will bid them adieu,
W:My hook, crook and black dog, I'll leave them to you;
W:My hook, crook and black dog, I'll leave here behind,
W:Since Flora, fair Flora, fair Flora, has chang-ed her mind.
