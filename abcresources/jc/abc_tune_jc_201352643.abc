w:The wild white rose_ is the sum-mer's glor-y, Why pray, take me a-way?"
W:"Today I left the town behind
W:To wander green country lane,
W:And now I'll take this wild white rose,
W:Of summer back on the train."
W:"Now stay your hand you gipsy townsman,
W:Who wanders the lane for all of a day,
W:The wild white rose is the summer's glory,
W:Why pray, take me away?"
W:
W:"But who should care if one wild rose
W:Should fade from summer-blue sky?
W:And who will know I leave you to grow,
W:My careless pleasure deny?"
W:"The bee that hums the brambled hedgerow,
W:The badger that haunts the fields of the night,
W:The bird that sings of summer treasure,
W:These your gifts will delight."
W:
W:"And who will thank my kindly deed
W:In sparing wild summer rose?
W:No voice of praise will favour me
W:But the grateful croaking of crows."
W:"The wind that sings of pardoned flowers
W:Will thankfully praise the deed you have done,
W:And voices sweet her tale repeat
W:In dawn-long bright as the sun."
W:
W:"And should I turn my hand away,
W:The hedgerow leaving unflawed,
W:And should I spare one wild white rose,
W:What then shall be my reward?"
W:"When next you leave the town behind you,
W:In green country lane to take your delight,
W:The summer day will grace your way
W:With wild rose blossoming bright."
