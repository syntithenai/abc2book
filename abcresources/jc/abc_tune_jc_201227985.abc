%% Don Primrose lives over in
%% Sullivan. By day, he's a contractor, but at night, ahah!
%% he's a contra dancer and a real fine caller, and one of the
%% several Spark plugs of the (famous!!) Monday Night Dance
%% in Nelson. He's also a great cookie cooker, and he's also
%% Shannon's dad (which says a lot right there!) :-)!
