%% If you browse around through
%% these little books you will find Dudley Laufman's name mentioned
%% several times, for one rason or another, but until now, there's
%% never been a tune titled just for him, with his name on it. Well,
%% there is now, Dudley, and I hope you like it well enough to play it
%% on your fiddle when the mood strikes. Perhaps you can get
%% your nice Jacqueline to give you a hand with it! Anyway, it comes to
%% you with very best wishes always to a greaty valued friend of many
%% happy years.
