w:Wich-et went a nood-le out, a nood-le he came home.
W:I went into my stable to see what I might see,
W:And there I saw three horses stand, by one, by two, by three.
W:I call'd unto my loving wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,
W:"O what do these three horses here without the leave of me?"
W:     "Why, old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three milking cows my mother sent to me?"
W:"Hey boys! Fill the cup! Milking cows with saddles up
W:The like was never known, the like was never known."
W:Old Wichet went a noodle out, a noodle he came home.

W:I went into the kitchen, to see what I might see,
W:And there I saw three swords hung up, by one, by two, by three.
W:I call'd unto my loving wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,
W:"O what do these three swords hang here without the leave of me?"
W:     "Why old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three toasting forks, my mother sent to me?"
W:"Hey boys! Well done! Toasting forks with scabbards on!
W:The like, &c.
W:
W:I went into the pantry, to see what I could see,
W:And there I saw three pair of boots, by one, by two, by three.
W:I call'd unto my loving wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,
W:"O what do these three pair of boots without the leave of me?"
W:     Why, old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three pudding bags, my mother sent to me?"
W:"Hey boys! Well done! Pudding bags with steel spurs on,
W:The like, &c.
W:
W:I went into the dairy, to see what I might see,
W:And there I saw three beavers, by one, by two, by three.
W:I called unto my kind wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,
W:"O what do these three beavers here without the leave of me?"
W:     "Why, old fool, blind fool! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three milking pails, my mother sent to me?"
W:"Hey boys! Well done! Milking pails with ribbons on,
W:The like, &c.
W:
W:I went into the chamber, to see what I might see,
W:And there I saw three men in bed, by one, by two, by three.
W:I called unto my kind wife, and "Coming Sir!" said she,
W:"O why sleep here three gentlemen without the leave of me?"
W:     "Why old fool! Blind fool! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three milking maids, my mother sent to me?"
W:"Hey boys! Well done! Milking maids with beards on,
W:The like, &c.
W:
W:I went about the chamber, as quick as quick might be,
W:I kicked the three men down the stairs, by one, by two, by three.
W:Without your hats and boots be off, your horses leave and flee,
W:Your purses 'neath your pillows left; they too belong to me.
W:     Why old wife, blind wife! can't you very well see,
W:     That these are three highwaymen from justice hid by thee?"
W:"Hey boys! purses left! knaves they be, and away are flown.
W:The like was never known, the like was never known!"
W:Old Wichet went a noodle out, a wise man he came home.
