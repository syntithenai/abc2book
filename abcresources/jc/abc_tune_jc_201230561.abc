%% Amy Larkin
%% is a really fine fiddler who hails from Sandwich,
%% MA. Steve Zakon-Anderson gets her to occasionally come
%% up to Peterborough for his 1st Saturday dance, and
%% lucky me, I get to play piano with her. Thanks
%% Steve, for making that happen; it's always a great
%% night of music; I love playing with you, Amy!
