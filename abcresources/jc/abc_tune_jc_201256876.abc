W:It's of a brisk young country lady,
W:Up to London she did go;
W:She fell in love with a jolly sailòr,
W:His canvas trousers as white as snow.
W:
W:His cheeks were like two blooming roses,
W:In summer they did fade and blow,
W:Saying "I do love my jolly sailor,
W:And dare not let my parents know.
W:
W:Drive on, drive on, my handsome coachman,
W:They are my horses, you need not fear,
W:It's now twenty minutes past eleven,
W:At the hour of twelve we must be there!"
W:
W:See how they whipped and spurred their horses
W:Through every town as they rode through,
W:With a golden band hanging round her middle,
W:And a foot-boy after her like lightning flew.
W:
W:They drove her up in twenty minutes,
W:Which caused those horses to sweat and die,
W:And the people being so much alarmèd
W:All for the lady they did cry.
W:
W:The King, he having so well regarded,
W:Saying, "She shall wed her sailor bold,
W:She shall wed her jolly sailor,
W:For no two such lovers were ever known!"
W:
W:She took her garment from her middle,
W:And gently folded it all on her arm,
W:Saying "The first shall touch is my jolly sailor,
W:And his life shall be at my command."
