%% Down Philly way there lives
%% a lovely young woman named Eugenia (a.k.a "Mickey")
%% Brennan who is Johnny's sister, and she's learning
%% to play the fiddle from her big brother - It's a cute scene,
%% and I hear by the grapevine that she's already working on
%% this tune - good luck with it, Mickey!
