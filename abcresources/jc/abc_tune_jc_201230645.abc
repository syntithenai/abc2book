%% Lissa Schneckenberger
%% is a wonderful fiddler. Originally from Massachusetts,
%% she now lives across the river in Brattleboro, Vermont,
%% which is pretty handy when Steve Zakon-Anderson gets her
%% to team up with an old piano player to play for the First
%% Saturday Dance in Peterborough. It's always great when
%% you're playing here, Lissa; Thanks for coming!
