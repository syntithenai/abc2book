Chris Worrall was the producer of the Lothian Scottish Dance Band's first recording. We first met Chris
when he asked us to make several broadcasts for Radio Forth and we liked the studio so much we used it
for our first two LP recordings. Chris later moved to join the BBC where he produced the Scottish Dance
Music programme every Saturday evening.
