W:
W:My father he's a knight and a knight of high renown 
W: If I should wed a soldier it would bring his honour down.                                   
W: It's your birth and my birth it never will agree,
W:So take it as a warning, bold dragoon, cried she.
W:
W:No warning, no warning, no warning will I take;
W:I'd rather die than live for my own true lover's sake.
W:The lady heard these words which made her heart to bleed.
W:To church they went together and got married with speed.
W:
W:In going up to church and coming back again
W:The lady spied her father with seven arm-ed men.
W:Look yonder, cried the lady, we both shall be slain
W:For yonder comes my father with seven arm-ed men.
W:
W:There is no time to prittle, there is no time to prattle
W:The soldier being all arm-ed prepared for the battle
W:The soldier with his broadsword he made their bones to rattle
W:And the lady held the horse while the dragoon fought the battle.
W:
W:Stay your hand, stay your hand, dragoon, he cried, dragoon, stay your hand,
W:For you shall have my daughter and ten thousand pound in hand.
W:Fight on, cried the lady, the portion is too small.
W:Fight on, my bold dragoon, you and I will have it all.
W:
W:Come all you honour-ed ladies that have got gold in store
W:Pray not despise a soldier although he may be poor,
W:For they are men of honour belonging to the crown
W:Here's a health to Queen Victoria and her jolly light dragoon.
W:
W:

W:(Version B)
W:
W:Come now all you good people, I pray now lend an ear.
W:'Tis of a jolly dragoon and soon ye shall hear.
W:He courted a lady, a lady rich and fair.
W:So how they got married O soon you shall har.
W:
W:My father was a knight and an honour to the crown
W:And if I wed a soldier you'll pull his honour down.
W:And thy birth and my birth will never agree,
W:So take it as an answer, dear dragoon, says she.
W:
W:An answer, an answer, an answer I won't take.
W:I'd rather lay my life down or of my love forsake.
W:In hearing of these words wishing the lady's heart to bleed
W:Together they went and was married with speed.
W:
W:O when they were married and returning back again
W:She saw her father coming took by armed men.
W:O dear, replies the lady, I fear we shall be slain.
W:O fear not al all, says the valiant dragoon.
W:
W:So now, dearest Polly, no time there is to prattle.
W:So see how they are armed and fix-ed for the battle.
W:He drawed his sword and pistol and the buckles they did rattle
W:The lady held the horse while the dragoon fought the battle.
W:
W:Now all good people that have got rich in store,
W:Never distain an soldier because he is poor.
W:For he that is poor will fight for his own.
W:Here's a health to the King and the jolly dragoon.
W:
W: 
W:
W:(Version C)
W:
W:My father he's a lord and a lord of high renown.
W:If I should wed a soldier it shall pull his honour down.
W:It's your birth and my birth it never will agree
W:So take it as a warning, bold dragoon, cried she.
W:
W:A warning, a warning I never intend to take.
W:I'd rather die than leave you it's all for your sweet sake.
W:And then he pressed her hand which made to heart to bleed.
W:To church let us go and get married with speed.
W:
W:As they were returning from church back again
W:She met her aged father and seven more arm-ed men
W:O now, says the lady, we both shall be slain
W:O feat not at all, says the jolly light dragoon.
W:With my braodside and cutlash I'll make they bones to rattle
W:And the lady held the horse while the dragoon fought the battle.
W:
W:Hold up, my bold dragoon, there i no time to prattle
W:For don't you see those arm-ed men all fitted for the battle
W:Hold up, my bold dragoon, my portion is but small;
W:Hold up, my boldest fellow, and you shall have it all.
W:Hold up, you bold dragoon, and boldly stand your ground
W:And you shall have my daughter and thirty thousand pound.
W:
W:And you young ladies who got bright gold in store
W:Never distain a soldier for that he is poor.
W:Although he is poor he will fight for his own.
W:Here's a health to King Edward and the jolly light dragoon.
