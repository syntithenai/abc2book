w:To rob her true love To rob her true_ love Syl-via did ride
W:Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia one day
W:She dressed herself in men's array
W:With a loaded pistol down by her side
W:To rob her true-love
W:To rob her true-love
W:Sylvia did ride
W:
W:As she rode up to him and she bid him stand
W:Stand and deliver all the gold that you have
W:Stand and deliver all your gold and store
W:Or else this moment
W:Or else this moment
W:Your life's no more
W:
W:He delivered up all his gold and store
W:But yet, she said, there is one thing more
W:There?s a diamond ring that I know you do wear
W:Deliver it
W:Deliver it
W:And your life I?ll spare
W:
W:Now this diamond ring being a token, give o?er
W:This ring I?ll keep or lose my life
W:She was tender-hearted just like a dove
W:She rode away
W:She rode away
W:From her own true-love
W:
W:Now as they were walking the garden green
W:He spied his watch hanging from her chain
W:He spied his watch hanging through her cloak
W:Which made her blush
W:Which made her blush
W:Like any rose
W:
W:What made you blush at so silly a thing?
W:I fain would have had your diamond ring
W:For 'twas I that robbed you on a plain
W:So to take your watch
W:So to take your watch
W:And gold again
W:
W:Now why did you enter such a silly plot
W:Suppose that pistol you did have shot
W:If you had shot me upon that plain
W:For ever after
W:For ever after
W:You'd be put to shame
W:
W:I only did it for to know
W:Whether you were a true-lover or no
W:But now I've a contented mind
W:My heart and all
W:My heart and all
W:My dear, are thine
W:
W:The match was made without delay
W:And soon they fixed the wedding day
W:And now they live in joy and content
W:In happiness
W:In happiness
W:Their days are spent
