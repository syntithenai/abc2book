W:Let us go a-tramping all together,
W:Thro' the bracken and the purple heather,
W:In the bright and sunny summer weather;
W:Now come tramping along with me.
W:
W:Come at dawn while all the birds are singing,
W:SIng our songs and set the valleys ringing,
W:With the lark we'll upward go a-winging,
W:Over mountains and over lea.
W:
W:We may rest when we are feeling weary,
W:But the path is never dull and dreary,
W:Over moorlands wild and sweet and eerie,
W:Oh! come tramping along with me.
