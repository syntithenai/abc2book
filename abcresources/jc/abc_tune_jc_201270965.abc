w:In Dev-*on-shire_ I drew my_ breath That place_ of no_ ted fame
W:Ye generals all and champions bold,
W:That takes delight in the field,
W:That knocks down palaces and castle walls,
W:But now to death must yield:
W:I am an Englishman by birth,
W:Lord Marlborough is my name,
W:In Devonshire I drew my breath,
W:That place of noted fame.
W:
W:I was beloved by all my men,
W:Kings and princes likewise
W:Its many a town I've often took,
W:I did the world surprise.
W:King Charles the Second I did serve,
W:To face our foes in France
W:And at the battle of Ramilles
W:We boldly did advance.
W:
W:The sun was down, the earth did shake,
W:So loudly did I cry:
W:"Fight on, my boys, for England's sake,
W:We'll conquer or we'll die!"
W:That very day my horse was shot,
W:'Twas by a musket ball,
W:And as I mounted up again,
W:My aide-de-camp did fall.
W:
W:Now I on a bed of sickness lie,
W:I am resign'd to die;
W:You generals all and champions bold,
W:Stand true as well as I.
W:Stand true, my lads, and take no bribe,
W:But fight with courgae bold,
W:I led my men through smoke and fire,
W:But never was brib'd by gold.
