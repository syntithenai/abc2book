w:See the yell-ow sheep-skin, Swing-ing from your should-ers,
c3B A3A |B3A G3G |A3G F3G |A4 D4 |
w:Once it raced the moun-tain-side And leapt the moun-tain bould-ers,
G3A B3c |d4 d4 |c3B c3A |d4 d4 |
w:Now the yel-low sheep-skin, Soft as cloud in sum-mer,
c3B A3A |B3A G3G |A3A d3d |G4 G4 |]
w:Whirls a-round from hand to hand And dan-ces for the drum-mer.
W:See the yellow sheepskin,
W:Swinging from your shoulders,
W:Once it raced the mountainside
W:And leapt the mountain boulders,
W:Now the yellow sheepskin,
W:Soft as cloud in summer,
W:Whirls around from hand to hand
W:And dances for the drummer.
W:
W:Take the yellow sheepskin,
W:Tenderly embrace it,
W:Once it climbed a mountain top
W:And had the wild wind chase it.
W:Now the yellow sheepskin,
W:Bright as sun in summer,
W:Capers like the firelight flames
W:And dances for the drummer.
