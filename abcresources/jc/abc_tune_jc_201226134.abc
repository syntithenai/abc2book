%% If you go to Juneau, Alaska, you can
%% eat dinner in a nice restaurant and watch the eagles fly up and down
%% the river. If you know the right people, you might even get to sleep in
%% a brand new bed, like I did when Jim Stey so kindly put me up on my
%% visit there. I really stayed in state, let me tell you! Thanks loads,
%% Jim, for the wonderful time you showed me -  I sure enjoyed being
%% with you --
