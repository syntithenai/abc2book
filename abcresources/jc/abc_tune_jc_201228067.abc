%% Lots of nice people live
%% over in Nelson, H.H., and a whole bunch of them are very fine
%% musicians! There's Harvey and Franke Tolman, Nat Hewitt,
%% Alouette Iselin, Finn Hewitt, and Liza Constable, just to
%% name a few. Liza plays guitar and sings, and she is also
%% a whiz-bang electric bass player with the Nelson-based
%% women's group, "The Rolling Crones". They're a great gang --
%% be sure and catch their act! *

%% * I more recently found out that currently, Liza also plays with two other groups,
%% "the Sevens", and "Chanterelle". I hope you get to hear their great music. I'm glad I did --
%% they played at the "Old Songs Festival", and they were the hit of the show!
