w:Their am-bi-tion was this de-ploy-ment from the minu-te they left the school.

w:See the world and rove and wan-der and they're hap-pi-er as a rule.
w:To the good friends that we trea-sure, for they al-ways are on our mind.
w:You may gain some sa-tis-fac-tion think-in', "Je-sus, at least I tried!"
