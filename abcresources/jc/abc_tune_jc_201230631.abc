%% My grand-son, Luke,
%% is in the Air Force, stationed over in Germany, where he
%% and his lovely wife, Laura, have managed to produce the
%% cutest little girl you ever saw. Her name is Jenna Leigh,
%% and so, of course, I had to write my great-grand-daughter a
%% tune to celebrate her arrival, Welcome to Earth, Jenna Leigh!
