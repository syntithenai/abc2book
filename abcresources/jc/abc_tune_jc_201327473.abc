w:Where in a Fi-li-pi-no bay,* Lived a boy called Quin-o-ro. *

w:While the oy-ster fleer was leav-ing Quin-o-ro would be griev-ing,
G/ A3/2A/ G3/2F/ |G8- |G2  |]
w:Too young to dive for pearl.
W:Beneath the blue Pacific sky,
W:Lies the island of Mindoro
W:Where in a Filipino bay,
W:Lived a boy called Quinoro.
W:He'd watch the boats go out to sea,
W:And their white sails unfurl,
W:While the oyster fleer was leaving
W:Quinoro would be grieving,
W:Too young to dive for pearl.
W:
W:One day Quinoro made a raft
W:From the timbers of tindalo,
W:When next the boats put out to sea,
W:He would secretly follow,
W:Across the silver-bright lagoon,
W:And the ocean of blue,
W:To the coral reefs of wonder,
W:Where pearls were divers' plunder,
W:Quinoro would go too.
W:
W:But when he dived beneath the sea
W:Where the coral weeds were swaying,
W:He found a water-jungle world,
W:Tiger-sharks ever preying,
W:And when a giant manta-ray,
W:Stirred a cloud-burst of sand,
W:Poor Quinoro, scared and lonely,
W:Regained his raft with only
W:One oyster in his hand.
W:
W:The laughing fishermen returned
W:To the island of Mindoro,
W:And last of oysters to be shelled
W:Was the catch of Quinoro.
W:It held a brightly gleaming pearl,
W:ROund as moon in its prime,
W:Now they take Quinoro fishing,
W:With all Mindoro wishing
W:He'll do it every time!
