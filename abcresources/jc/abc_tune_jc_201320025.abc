Firak09-09-2008, 05:49 PMThankfuly every aspect of the execution of a given piece,
either stylistic (staccato, legato etc.) or functional (velocity),
will be the domain of the human performer
and no artifical musicplayer will ever gets close to it .

BinabikErebor09-09-2008, 07:52 PMThat depends somewhat on the performer :-) And I'm but a very mediocre guitarplayer -- on quite a few occasions outperformed by the ingame Lute :-)
But I find these ABC files a great way to learn to read my notes better.
So far, a note was a location on a fret -- but while transcribing this to ABC, I learnt to put names to the notes.
It's a great game ;-)

Firak10-09-2008, 10:01 PMYes it is indeed a great way to learn something about
musicnotation through a game .
And some song really sound nice :)
