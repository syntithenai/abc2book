%% Mary Lou Philbin and Charlie Clarke are two lovely people, good friends, from
%% Loudon, N.H., (just outside of Concord) who, as Ossian USA (603-783-4383) are
%% doing a wonderful job as performer agents, concert producers, and sellers of
%% traditional Irish music, both written and recorded. They are relatively new
%% in the business, but a great deal of their extensive offerings is only
%% available from them in the states. They are the agents for my new band "Old
%% New England," and I'm glad this opportunity came along for me to help promote
%% their business! Good luck, you guys. (Hope you like your new waltz! :-))
