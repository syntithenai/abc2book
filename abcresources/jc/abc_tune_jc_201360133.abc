W:Near to Banbridge Town, in the County Down
W:One morning in July,
W:Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,
W:And she smiled as she passed me by;
W:Oh, she looked so neat from her two white feet
W:To the sheen of her nut-brown hair,
W:Sure the coaxing elf, I'd to shake myself
W:To make sure I was standing there
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Oh, from Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,
W:  And from Galway to Dublin town,
W:  No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
W:  That I met in the County Down.
W:
W:As she onward sped I shook my head
W:And I gazed with a feeling quare,
W:And I said, says I, to a passer-by,
W:"Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"
W:Oh, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,
W:"That's the gem of Ireland's crown,
W:She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
W:She's the Star of the County Down."
W:
W:I've travelled a bit, but never was hit
W:Since my roving career began;
W:But fair and square I surrendered there
W:To the charms of young Rose McCann.
W:I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet
W:Did I meet with in shawl or gown,
W:But in she went and I asked no rent
W:From the Star of the County Down.
W:
W:At the crossroads fair I'll be surely there
W:And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes
W:And I'll try sheep's eyes, and deludhering lies
W:On the heart of the nut-brown Rose.
W:No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
W:Though with rust my plow turns brown,
W:Till a smiling bride by my own fireside
W:Sits the Star of the County Down.
