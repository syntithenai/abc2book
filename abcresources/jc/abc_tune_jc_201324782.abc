w:Fal de ral ri; fal de ral lal lal li day!
W:I work-ed for a gentleman, I work-ed by the day
W:Down in a lit-tle garden, Close by the highway
W:Fal de ral ri; fal de ral lal lal li day!

W:I saw something dancing, I thought it was a hare -
W:Why don't you go and catch it and catch it in a snare?
W:
W:I got up the next morning, a-seeking for my prey,
W:A keeper sat in an arbour-bush, close by the highway.
W:
W:He hopped me off to prison, I suffered more and more,
W:For six long months, or better, my bed was made of straw.
W:
W:I had a very large family at home, and all my neighbours say
W:They only had one half-peck loaf for eight long summer's day.
