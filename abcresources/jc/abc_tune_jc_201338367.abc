Q:450
N:Contrary to the key signature, this tune is in a common
N:Swedish mode with a tonal centre of G that contains a C
N:sharp, but no F sharp, The title comes from the fact that my
N:car has no convenient places to put things like food when
N:you're driving, so it tends to slide across in front of the dash.
N:Aside from that it's a very nice car, and the organic pies from
N:Riverford are excellent too.
