%% Every so often I get to play for one of
%% the Thursday Night dances at the VFW hall in Cambridge, MA, thanks
%% to Larry Jennings and Dan Pearl and the committee. When the dance
%% is over, this lovely young woman named Leslie Morrison shows
%% up at the stage with the cash box. Leslie is the treasurer, and she
%% always sends us home happy with what we just did. Of course, we
%% had a good time playing the music, but we are grateful for what Leslie
%% does, too.  Thanks a lot, leslie!
