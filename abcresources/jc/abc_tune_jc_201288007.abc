W:There is a house in New Orleans,
W:they call The Rising Sun.
W:And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl,
W:And me, oh God, was one.
W:
W:If I had listened to what mama said
W:I'd be at home today,
W:but being so young and foolish a poor girl
W:let a gambler lead me astray
W:
W:My mother is a tailor,
W:She sews those new blue jeans,
W:my sweet heart is a drunkard, Lord
W:down in New Orleans.
W:
W:The only thing a drunkard needs
W:Is a suitcase and a trunk,
W:And the only time he's satisfied
W:Is when he's on a drunk.
W:
W:He'll fill his glasses to the brim,
W:he passes them around,
W:and the only pleasure he gets out of life
W:is bumming from town to town.
W:
W:Go tell my baby sister,
W:never do like i haave done
W:to shun tat house in Nes Orleans
W:they call The Rising Sun.
W:
W:It's one foot on the platform,
W:and the other one on the train.
W:I'm going back to New Orleans
W:To wear that ball and chain.
W:
W:I'm going back to New Orleans
W:my race is almost run.
W:I'm going back to spend my life
W:beneath The Rising Sun.
