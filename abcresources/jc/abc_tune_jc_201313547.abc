W:A lawyer he went out one day

W:And who should he spy but some fair pretty maid,
W:So handsome and so clever.

W:(Chorus)
W:"Where are you going to, my pretty maid?
W:Where are you going, my honey?"
W:"Going over the hills, kind sir," she said,
W:"To my father a-mowing the barley."
W:
W:The laywer, he went out next day,
W:A-thinking for to view her;
W:But she gave him the slip and away she went,
W:All over the hills to her father.
W:
W:This laywer had a useful nag,
W:And soon he overtook her,
W:He caught her around the middle so small,
W:And on his horse he placed her.
W:
W:And now she is the laywer's wife,
W:And dearly the lawyer loves her.
W:They live in a happy content of life,
W:And well in the station above her.
