  Tags: summer, sumerisicumenin, vacationtime, vacation, holiday, cuckoo Sunday April 1, 2007 - 12:54pm (EDT) Permanent Link | 2 Comments Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Frideric Haendel and...     Turlough O'Carolan.
Three great composers all living in the same period, two of whom have been favored by history with justified fame, but the third has been, at least in my opinion, unjustly neglected. I refer the interested reader to The Old Music Project to learn more about one of Ireland's greatest musicians as we approach Saint Patrick's Day 2007.
To describe the blind Irish harper as "the Irish Bach" is to suggest that he was in some way inferior to the great German composer. Something which is unfair to both men.
And if you need more encouragement to explore O'Carolan's music, I hope you will take a few moments to copy the code below, and paste it here where you can listen to a midi rendition or save the score in Adobe PDF format.
