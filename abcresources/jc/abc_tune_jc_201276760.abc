W:Mavourneen's the flower of Killarney,
W:The fairest of all to me.
W:The roses that bloom in Killarney,
W:Are never as fair as she.
W:The land of the mists and mountains
W:For ever her home shall be,
W:For she is the flower of Killarney
W:And fairest of all to me.
W:
W:As sunlight and shadow go ranging,
W:O'er woodland and lake and hill,
W:Their beauty for ever is changing,
W:Each moment seems sweeter still,
W:But neither the sun nor the shadow
W:Can add to her beauty's grace
W:Nor roses can rival in sweetness
W:The love in her charming face.
W:
W:Though mountain and woodland may perish,
W:And roses may fade and fall,
W:Yet still in my heart I will cherish
W:The fairest among them all,
W:The land of the mists and mountains
W:Forever her home shall be,
W:For she is the flower of Killarney,
W:And fairest of all to me.
