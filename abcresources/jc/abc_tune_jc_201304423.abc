w:Blow sum-mer breeze, o'er the sea, Bring my pret-ty love to me.
W:I'll weave my love a garland,
W:It shall be dressed so fine;

W:I wish I were an arrow,
W:That sped into the air;
W:To seek him as a sparrow,
W:And if he was not there,
W:Then quickly I'd become a fish
W:To search the ragining sea;
W:For I love my love, and I love my love,
W:Because my love loves me.
W:Blow &c.

W:I would I were a reaper,
W:I'd seek him in the corn;
W:I would I were a keeper,
W:I'd hunt him with my horn.
W:I'd blow a blast, when found at last,
W:Beneath the greenwood tree.
W:For I love my love, and I love my love,
W:Because my love loves me.
W:Blow &c.
