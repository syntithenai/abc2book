%% This past weekend I played a Happy Halloween
%% dance in Lyme, N.H., with the Sherrys and Wayne and Ruth and Bill. This is
%% Muskeg Music country, and they sure were nice to me. They like waltzes
%% pretty well up there, so here is their very own, with many thanks
%% and fondest best wishes always to Dave Millstone and all the rest of
%% the Muskeggers.
