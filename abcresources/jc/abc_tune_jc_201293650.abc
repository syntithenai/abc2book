W:John Appleby was a man's name, he lived near the sign of the Kettle,
W:His wife she was call-ed Joan Quiet, because she could scold but a little
W:John to the ale-house would go, Joan to the gin-shop would run;
W:John would get drunk with the women and Joan would get drunk with the men.
W:
W:Now Joan she was no great eater, and John he wasn't a glutton;
W:And so for to tickle their jaws they bought 'em a sholder of mutton;
W:John in an angry mood caught the mutton up with his hand,
W:And out of the window he threw it while Joan she was at a stabd.
W:
W:Now Joan she was at a stand, didn't know what to make of the matter,
W:So catching it up in her hand she after it threw the platter;
W:An old woman passing by and seeing the mutton there lay,
W:She caught up both mutton and platter and with it she ran away.
W:
W:Now John he had got a full barrel well seasoned with home-grown hops;
W:And so for to finish the quarrel the question to Joan he pops:
W:"Shall we spicket the home-brewed, Joan, and all of our neighbours regale?
W:Although we have lost our mutton we have not lost our ale."
W:
W:Then the neighbours came flocking in (O wasn't there just a commotion?)
W:With "Wastebutt" and most of his kin all aiming to get at the lotion.
W:They banged the old barrel about and pulled the spicket out too,
W:Saying "We'll all get drunk to-night, for what have we else to do?"
