%% Dale Thomas is a good friend
%% of long standing, and it's always such a pleasure to
%% see him every year at the New England Folk Festival. He
%% is a man of many talents, and one thing he knows how to
%% do real well is make a good cup of coffee!  I've been
%% thankful to you for a long while, Dale, and I'm glad
%% this tune came along to tell you so.
