W:There is a house in New Orleans,

W:And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,

W:My mother was a tailor,
W:She sewed my new blue jeans.
W:My father was a gamblin' man
W:Down in New Orleans
W:
W:Now the only thing a gambler needs
W:Is a suitcase and a trunk,
W:And the only time he'll be satisfied
W:Is when he's all drunk.
W:
W:Oh, mother, tell your children
W:Not to do what I have done;
W:Spend your lives in sin and misery
W:In the House of the Rising Sun.
W:
W:Well, I've got one foot on the platform,
W:The other foot on the train
W:I'm going back to New Orleans
W:To wear my ball and chain.
W:
W:Well, there is a house in New Orleans
W:They call the Rising Sun,
W:And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
W:And God I know I'm one.
