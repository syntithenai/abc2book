W:Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling,
W:From glen to glen and down the mountain side.
W:The summer's gone and all the leaves are falling,
W:'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.
W:  But come ye back, when summer's in the meadow,
W:  and all the valley's hushed and white with snow.
W:  And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
W:  Oh, Danny Boy, oh, Danny Boy, I love you so!
W:
W:But when ye come, and all the flow'rs are dying
W:and I am dead, as dead I well may be,
W:Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,
W:and kneel and say an Ave there for me;
W:  And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread a bove me,
W:  and all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
W:  for you will bend, and tell me that you love me,
W:  and I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!
W:  Oh, Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so!
