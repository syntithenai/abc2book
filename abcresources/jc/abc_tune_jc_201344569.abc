w:And_ by his dai-ly la-bour he pro_ vid-ed__ for_ them all
W:'Tis of a bold thresherman lived down by the country side,
W:Who for his wife and family daily did provide,
W:He'd sixteen in his family, and most of them were small;
W:And by his daily labour he provided for them all.
W:
W:As this poor man was returning from his labour one day.
W:He met a wealthy squire who thus to him did say;
W:"O thresherman! O thresherman! will you kindly tell to me
W:How you maintain your wife, and your large family?"
W:
W:"I arise, Sir, every morning, at the break of the day,
W:I work like a slave, all for the smallest of pay,
W:And from hedging or from ditching to the milking of a cow,
W:There's nothing comes amiss to me from the harrow to the plough.
W:
W:"When I go home at night, Sir, as tired as can be,
W:The youngest of my family he sits upon my knee;
W:And all the rest come prattling round me as I sing with joy,
W:And this is all the comfort that a poor man can enjoy.
W:
W:"There's my wife, gentle creature, as faithful as can be,
W:We live like two turtledoves and never disagree.
W:But still the times grow harder, and I am very poor,
W:I hardly know how to keep the wolf from the door."
W:
W:"Now since you have spoken so well of your wife,
W:I'll make you live happy the rest of your life,
W:Here's sixty acres of good land I'll freely give to thee,
W:To maintain your wife and your large family."
