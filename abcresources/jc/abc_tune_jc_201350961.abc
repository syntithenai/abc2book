w:And there she met her_ true love, And he un-to her did say
W:Come all you pretty fair maids, and listen to my song,
W:While I relate a story that does to love belong:
W:'Tis of a blooming damsel walked though the fields so gay,
W:And there she met her true love, and unto her did say:
W:
W:"Where are you going, young Nancy, this morning bright and gay?
W:Or why do you walk here alone? Come tell to me, I pray."
W:"I am going to yonder river-side, where fishes they do swim,
W:All for to gather flowers that grow around the brim."
W:
W:"Be not in haste, young Nancy," this young man he did say,
W:"And I will bear you company and guard you on the way,
W:I live on yonder river-side where fishes they do swim,
W:Where you may gather flowers that grow around the brim."
W:
W:"Kind Sir, you must excuse me", this maiden did reply,
W:"I will not walk with any man until the day I die;
W:I have a sweetheart of my own, and him my heart has won:
W:He lived in yonder cottage, a wealthy farmer's son."
W:
W:"And pray what is your lover's name?" he unto her did say,
W:"Though in my tarry trousers, perhaps I know him may."
W:She said "His name is William, from that I'll never run;
W:This ring we broke at parting. He's a wealthy famer's son."
W:
W:The ring out of his pocket he instantly then drew,
W:Saying "Nancy, here's the parting gift; one half I left with you.
W:I have been pressed to sea, and many a battle won;
W:But still your heart could ne'er depart from me, the farmer's son."
W:
W:When these words she heard him say, it put her in surprise,
W:The tear-drops they came trinkling down fro her sparkling eyes.
W:"Oh, soothe your grief!" the young man cried, "the battle you have won,
W:For Hymen's chains shall bind us - you and the farmer's son."
W:
W:To church, then, went this couple, and married were with speed.
W:The villiage bells they all did ring, and the girls did dance indeed.
W:She blessed the happy hour she in the fields did run,
W:To seek all for her true love, the wealthy farmer's son.
