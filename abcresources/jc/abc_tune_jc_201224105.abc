%% One of the fringe benefits of being at the Ralph Page Legacy Weekend is
%% getting to visit with George Fogg. George is from Boston, and he's a really
%% fine dance leader, specializing in English dances. A jolly man, he has
%% great energy, and it's always a pleasure to work for him. I hope it happens
%% again real soon, George!
