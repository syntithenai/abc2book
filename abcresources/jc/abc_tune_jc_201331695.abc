w:And the lads and the bon-ny las-ses to the sheep shear-ing go.
W:Here the rosebuds in June, and the violets are blowing
W:The small birds they warble on ev'ry green bough,
W:Here's the pink and the lily, and the daffy down dilly
W:To adorn and perfume those sweet meadows in June.

W:Chorus:
W:If it weren't for the plough the fat ox would go slow
W:And the lads and the bonny lasses to the sheep shearing go.
W:
W:Our shepherds rejoice in their fine heavy fleeces,
W:And the frisky young lambs which their flocks do increase.
W:Each lad takes his lass all on the green grass,
W:To adorn and perfume those meadows in June.
W:
W:Our clean milking pails, they are fouled with good ale,
W:At the table there is plenty of cheer to be found.
W:We'll whistle and sing, and dance in a ring,
W:To adorn and perfume those sweet meadows in June.
W:
W:Now the sheep shearing's over and the harvest draws nigh;
W:We'll prepare for the fields our strength for to try:
W:We'll reap and we'll mow, we'll plough and we'll sow,
W:To adorn and perfume those sweet meadows in June.
