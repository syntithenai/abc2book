%% Mary Etter has always been
%% so nice to me at Neffa each year that I decided to try
%% and pay her back with a tune. If the tune's no good,
%% then it just goes to prove that the road to hell is paved
%% with good intentions~ But I did try, and in any
%% case, thanks, Mary for all your help to me -
%% love, Bob
