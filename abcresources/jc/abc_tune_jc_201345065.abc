N: The 2nd phrase has a begin repeat but no end repeat.
N: Repeats added to satisfy the "Each Strain twice" instruction.
N: The D.C. at the end seems superfluous; the dance seems to be 32 bars long.
N: Perhaps the tune was meant to be played AABA?  Or maybe the dance should end in the middle?
N: The tied notes are single 3-count notes in CCDTB, two notes in CCDM2.
N: The first halves of the dances are different; the second halves are the same.
