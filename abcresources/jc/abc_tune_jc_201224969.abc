%% I've known Cia Iselin
%% (pro. "Keeya isslin") and her wonderful family for probably
%% more years than either of us cares to talk about, and every time
%% I go over to the Folkway she always gives me the warmest possible
%% welcome. I really appreciate all you do for us, Cia, and I'm so
%% glad this little tune came along with your name in the title space.
%% Much love to you, from Bob --
