w: ground for the floor_ If you look down_ be-* low_ you'll find ground for the floor.
W:I've lived in a wood for a number of years,
W:With my dog and my gun I drive away all cares;
W:I've a neat little cottage, and the roof it is secure,
W:If you look down below you'll find ground for the floor.
W:
W:My cot it is surrounded with bramble and thorn,
W:And sweet are the notes of the birds in the morn;
W:I've a guinea in my pocket and plenty more in store,
W:If you look down below you'll find ground for the floor.
W:
W:My bed's made of straw my limbs to repose
W:And as for myself I've but one suit of clothes;
W:And that's made of ticking, all stiched up secure,
W:If you look down below you'll find ground for the floor.
W:
W:As for grates I've got none, for my fire's on the ground,
W:And chairs I've got none to set myself down;
W:I've a three-legged stool, it's the chief of my store,
W:IN my neat little cottage with ground for the floor.
W:
W:God bless my dear father, he's dead and he's gone,
W:I hope he's safe in heaven, where he'll never more return;
W:He's left me all his riches, and I've plenty more in store,
W:In my neat little cottage with ground for the floor.
