W:You constant lovers give attention
W:While a tale to you I tell,
W:Concerning of two lovers true,
W:Who in one house for years did dwell:
W:Rosetta was a farmer’s daughter,
W:And always was her parents’ joy,
W:Till Cupid in a snare had caught her,
W:With her father’s gay ploughboy. 
W:
W:At break of day each summer’s morning
W:William for his horses went,
W:And as he viewed bright Phoebus dawning,
W:He would listen with content
W:To the voice of sweet Rosetta,
W:Which charmed young Williams heart with joy
W:Who was her father’s gay plough boy.
W:
W:She sat and sung of her sweet William,
W:As she milked her spotted cow;
W:And he would sigh for his Rosetta
W:All the day while at the plough;
W:And as evening did approach,
W:Rosetta tript along with joy,
W:With voice so shrill, to meet young Will,
W:Who was her father’s gay ploughboy.
W:
W:Her father came into the dairy,
W:While she sung her tale of love,
W:He fixed his eyes to her surprise,
W:And swore by all the powers above
W:That he was told the hussy bold
W:Along with poverty did toy,
W:And that long time she had been courting
W:Of young Will, her gay ploughboy.
W:
W:Rosetta said “My dearest father,
W:Shall I speak with courage bold?
W:I milk my cow, I love the plough,
W:I value William more than gold:’
W:Then in a cellar he confined her,
W:Where one could her annoy,
W:And with delight,both day and night,
W:She sighed for Will, her gay ploughboy.
W:
W:Fifteen long months on bread and water
W:Sweet Rosetta was confined,
W:So fast in love had Cupid caught her,
W:No one thing could change her mind.
W:Her father strove with all his might
W:Her happiness for to destroy,
W:But nothing could Rosetta daunt,
W:She doated on her gay ploughboy.
W:
W:At length grim death her father summoned
W:From this sinful world of care,
W:And then to his estate and fortune
W:Rosetta was the only heir.
W:Then she and William were united,
W:No one could their peace destroy,
W:The village bells did call Rosetta,
W:And young Will, her gay ploughboy.
W:
W:For miles around the lads and lasses
W:Merrily for them did sing,
W:At their wedding all was joyful,
W:And the village hells did ring.
W:No couple can be more contented,
W:Their happiness none can destroy,
W:They sing with joy “God speed the plough’
W:Rosetta and her gay ploughboy.
