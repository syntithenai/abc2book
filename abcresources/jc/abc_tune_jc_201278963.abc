W: Chorus:
W: She wore no jewels or costly diamonds,
W: No paint or powder, no none at all.
W: She wore a bonnet, with a ribbon on it,
W: and around her shoulder was a Galway shawl.
W:
W: As we kept walking, she kept on talking,
W: till her father's cottage came in to view.
W: She said, 'Come in Sir and meet my father,
W: and for to please him, play the Foggy Dew.'
W:
W: I played the 'Blackbird' and 'The Stack of Barley',
W: 'Rodney's Glory' and 'The Foggy Dew.'
W: She sang each note like an Irish linnet,
W: and the tears flowed in her eyes of blue.
W:
W: 'Twas early, early, in the morning,
W: I hit the road for old Donegal.
W: Said she, 'Goodbye Sir', as she cried,
W: and my heart remained with the Galway shawl.
