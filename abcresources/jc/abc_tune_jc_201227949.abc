%% As everybody knows,
%% lots of nice people live on the West Coast, many of
%% them in Seattle (of course!), and it turns out that one of
%% the very nicest of them all is Warren Argo's lovely wife,
%% Cindy Hartman. At least, this is what _I_ think, and actually,
%% I bet you do, too, because she sure is a winner from 'way back!
%% [heart with arrow through it] XX OO!
