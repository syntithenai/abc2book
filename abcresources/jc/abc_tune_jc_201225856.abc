%% Drew Smith hails from
%% HO-HO-KUS, NJ (I don't understand "HO-HO-KUS" either, but that's what
%% it is) and he plays the best autoharp around. He's the only one I ever heard
%% play one of those things and drive a morocycle at the same time, which
%% I think is fairly unusual - I look forward to our next encounter, Drew -
%% we'll have a few tunes together --
