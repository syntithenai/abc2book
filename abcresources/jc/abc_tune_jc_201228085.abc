%% Up in North Sandwich, NH,
%% is where the Jose family lives. Leslie is the mother, and I first met her
%% when she was making wonderful pancakes for us all at the Eneguess
%% family's camp, Deer Run North, in Errol, NH, on Lake Umbagog, back
%% in the summer of '73. In more recent times, she and her nice son,
%% Mike, have been showing up at the dances in Peterborough and Nelson.
%% It's always such a pleasure to see them. I sure hope you like your
%% tune, Mike!! My love to you both -  Bob
