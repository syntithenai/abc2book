W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie,"
W:These words came low and mournfully
W:From the pallid lips of a youth who lay
W:On his dying bed at the close of day.
W:
W:He had wailed in pain till o'er his brow
W:Death's shadows fast were gathering now;
W:He thought of his home and his loved ones nigh
W:As the cowboys gathered to see him die.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me,
W:In a narrow grave just six by three.
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie."
W:
W:
W:"In fancy I listen to the well known words
W:Of the free, wild winds and the song of the birds;
W:I think of home and the cottage in the bower
W:And the scenes I loved in my childhood's hour.
W:
W:"It matters not, I've oft been told,
W:Where the body lies when the heart grows cold;
W:Yet grant, oh, grant this wish to me:
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, then bury me not on the lone prairie,"
W:In a narrow grave six foot by three,
W:Where the buffalo paws o'er a prairie sea,
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:I've always wished to be laid when I died
W:In the little churchyard on the green hillside;
W:By my father's grave there let mine be,
W:And bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:"Let my death slumber be where my mother's prayer
W:And a sister's tear will mingle there,
W:Where my frieneds can come and weep o'er me;
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:In a narrow grave just six by three,
W:Where the buzzard waits and the wind blows free,
W:Then bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:"There is another whose tears may be shed
W:For one who lies on a prairie bed;
W:It pained me then and it pains me now --
W:She has curled these locks, she has kissed this brow.
W:
W:"These locks she has curled, shall the rattlesnake kiss:
W:This brow she has kissed, shall the cold grave press:
W:For the sake of the loved ones that will weep for me,
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me,
W:Where the buzzards sail and the wind goes free,
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not--" And his voice failed there,
W:But we took no heed of his dying prayer;
W:In a narrow grave just six by three
W:We buried him there on the lone prairie.
W:
W:Where the dewdrops glow and the butterflies rest,
W:And the flowers bloom o'er the prairie's crest;
W:Where the wild coyote and winds sport free
W:On a wet saddle blanket lay a cowboy-ee.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:Where the wild coyotes will howl o'er me,
W:Where the rattlesnakes hiss and the crow flies free,
W:Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie."
W:
W:
W:Oh, we buried him there on the lone prairie
W:Where the wild rose blooms and the wind blows free;
W:Oh, his pale young face nevermore to see --
W:For we buried him there on the lone prairie.
W:
W:Yes, we buried him there on the lone prairie,
W:Where the owl all night hoots mournfully,
W:And the blizzard beats and the winds blow free
W:O'er his lowly grave on the lone prairie.
W:
W:And the cowboys now as they roam the plain --
W:For they marked the spot where his bones were lain --
W:Fling a handful of roses o'er his grave,
W:With a prayer to Him who his soul will save.
W:
W:
W:"Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie
W:Where the wolves can howl and growl o'er me;
W:Fling a handful of roses o'er my grave
W:With a prayer to Him who my soul will save."
