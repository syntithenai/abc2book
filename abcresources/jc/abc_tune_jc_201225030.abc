%% If you've been to the Folkway Coffee House
%% here in Peterborough, then you have seen a busy young man setting up
%% the sound system and getting the stage ready for the evening's performance.
%% That young man is Jay Iselin, and he sure goes out of his way
%% to make me welcome when I go there. I can't thank you enough,
%% Jay - perhaps this tune will tell you how much I appreciate your
%% hospitality!
