%% Walter Dudley lives up in Concord, NH -
%% He is a friend of Dorma Maglin and he, too, is, to some degrees at least, a
%% domesticated rat fancier. Walter's got a really nice old Sears-Roebuck
%% (pre-Silverstone) Mandolin that he likes to play tunes on (when he's not busy
%% making music tapes to give to his friends) and so I thought you might like to
%% try out your own tune, Walter - and by the way, thanks a lot for that last
%% tape - I really appreciated getting it!
