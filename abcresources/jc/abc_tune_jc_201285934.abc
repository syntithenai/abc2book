W:Down from the hills of Brecon
W:Flew a hungry Heron,
W:In a barrel he bumped his head,
W:And he said,
W:"Boom, boom, boom, boom!
W:Apples I've hit my neck on!"
W:
W:Up from the barrel rising,
W:He, most enterprising,
W:Took the apples to market town,
W:Knocked them down,
W:"Boom, boom, boom, boom!"
W:All at a price surprising.
W:
W:Yellow and red and dapple
W:Every single apple
W:Went to children who cried for more,
W:Score by score,
W:"Boom, boom, boom, boom!"
W:Fast as their hands could grapple.
W:
W:Where there had once been many,
W:Soon there was not any.
W:Back the Heron flew, very proud,
W:Shouting loud,
W:"Boom, boom, boom, boom!
W:One thousand for a penny!"
