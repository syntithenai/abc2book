%% If you ever danced in Fairbanks, AK, afew years
%% back, you probably danced in Susan MacNeil's Raven Lodge. It was a good big building
%% made entirely out of enormous cedar logs; really, it was just beautiful, and
%% it had a huge wood furnace heating it that took great four foot logs with ease.
%% What a place! I think that was first time I'd played with fine Alaska fiddler
%% Rex Blazer, and we sure had a good time together. A woman whose name I can't recall
%% played flute, and we had so much fun they should have named us the "Gleesome
%% Threesome"!
