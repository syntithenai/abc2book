W:Come all you men thoughout this nation
W:I will have you warning take by me
W:Don't be like me ill-treat your servants
W:When you sail on the raging sea.
W:
W:This boy was bound to me apprentice
W:This boy was bound to me, I say,
W:From Saint Giles's Workhouse I hailed him
W:For this poor boy was motherless.
W:
W:One day this boy he did offend me
W:But little to him I did say,
W:To the mizzen-top I hauled him
W:And kept him there all that long day.
W:
W:His hands, his feet they were exhausted.
W:His arms, his legs, they were likewise.
W:With my marlin-spike I cruelly gagg-ed him
W:Because I could not bear to hear his cries.
W:
W:With my log-line I cruelly beat him,
W:So cruelly I can't deny.
W:Through my cruel and bad ill-treatment
W:The very next morning this poor boy died.
W:
W:So now my men, they do eject me,
W:To think that I have done so wrong.
W:In my cabin they closely confin-ed me
W:And brought me to London in an iron strong.
W:
W:So now my trial do come over
W:And here lay I condemned to die.
W:If I had 'a' been my manners been ruly
W:I might have saved the poor boy's life and mine.
