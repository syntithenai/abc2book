%% At this year's Seattle
%% Folklife Festival, Steve Trampe once again gathered together
%% the greatest gang of female fiddlers you ever heard. Known
%% as the "Fab Girls", they played for a contra dance in the
%% Road House, and I was lucky enough to play piano for
%% them. Sono Hashisake was one of the fiddlers, and she
%% worked so hard, I thought she deserved a tune of her own.
%% So here it is, Sono, and I hope you like it!
