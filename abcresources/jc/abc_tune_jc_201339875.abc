N:by Si Garbutt: According to the notes to Susan Songer's Portland Collection,  which
N:contains  a  couple  of  his  tunes  ("Spootiskerry" and "Bert Ferguson"), the late
N:Samuel Ian Rothmar Burns lived in the Shetland Isles.  Ian Burns, as he was  known,
N:published  a book of tunes, also entitled "Spootiskerry".  It is the name of a farm
N:in his family. His daughter, June Mann, lives in Cunningsburgh in the Shetlands and
N:gave  the  info to Susan Songer.  I believe I read somewhere that "spoots" are some
N:sort of shellfish - razor clams, I think (and a skerry is a group  of  rocks  which
N:are  sometimes visible above sea-level, sometimes not, depending on the tide).  The
N:tune is sometimes known as "Spoot o' Skerry" and there is a young  Celtic  band  of
N:that name - from Canberra!
