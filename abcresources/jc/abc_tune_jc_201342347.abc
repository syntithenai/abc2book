W:O father, father, build me a boat,
W:That on this wild ocean I may float,
W:And every ship that I chance to meet
W:I will enquire for my William sweet.
W:
W:I had not sailed more than half an hour,
W:Before I met with a man on board (man of war?)
W:"Kind captain, captain, come tell me true,
W:Is my sweet William on board with you?"
W:
W:"Oh no, fine lady, he is not here,
W:That he is drown-ed most breaks my fear,
W:For the other night when the wind blew high
W:That's when you lost your sweet sailor boy."
W:
W:I'll set me down, and I write a song,
W:I'll write it neat, and I'll write it long,
W:And at every word I will drop a tear,
W:And in every line I'll set my Willie dear.
W:
W:I wish, I wish, but it's all in vain,
W:I wish I was a sweet maid again,
W:But a maid, a maid I never shall be
W:Till apples grow on an orange tree.
W:For a maid, a maid, I shall never be,
W:Till apples grow on an orange tree.
