%% I've said, "it's always"
%% several times in these tune notes, but it really is
%% always a pleasure when I get to jam with the wonderful
%% fiddler George Wilson at the Dance Flurry. I'm not
%% much of a box player, but we get along OK and
%% have a good time, and that's what it's all about.
%% Thanks ever so much, George!
