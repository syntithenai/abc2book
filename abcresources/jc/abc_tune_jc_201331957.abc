W:As I was a-walking on Scarborough Sands,
W:Some dainty fine sport for to view,
W:The lasses were crying and wringing their hands,
W:"O the Rout it is come for the Blues, for the Blues,
W:O the Rout it is come for the Blues."
W:
W:A fair pretty maid to her mother did say,
W:"My heart's full of love - it is true.
W:I'll pack up my clothes, without any delay,
W:And travel the world with the Blues, with the Blues,
W:And travel the world with the Blues."
W:
W:"They're as gallant young fellows as ever you'll see,
W:Though you search Bonny Britain all through.
W:When dressed in His Majesty's suit, you'll agree,
W:There are none can compare with the Blues, with the Blues,
W:There are none can compare with the Blues."
W:
W:The landlords and landladies, hand in hand trip,
W:And so do the young lasses, too,
W:You'd have laughed to have seen them along the sands skip,
W:All to take their farewell of the Blues, of the Blues,
W:All to take their farewell of the Blues.
W:
W:The boats are afloat, the gallant men her,
W:The trumpet that soundeth so true.
W:They lift up their voices, and give a loud cheer,
W:Success to the King and his Blues, and his Blues,
W:Success to King George and his Blues.
