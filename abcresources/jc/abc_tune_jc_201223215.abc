%% Well, today's Friday all right, but I
%% sure as hell didn't write this tune for the day of the week; I
%% wrote it for Mary Kay Friday of Washsington, D.C., who was instrumental
%% in getting "Greengate" and me down to Maryland for the
%% Chesapeake Spring Dance Weekend. Susie Elberger called and we
%% had such a nice time - Thanks ever so much, Mary Kay!
