w:One day I took a ram-ble_ down by a run-ning stream. Where the wa-ter lil-lies gam-bol it was a lov-ely scene__ And there I saw a mai-den, a mai-den from the dell: She was gath-'ring wa-ter cres-ses 'twas Mar-tha the wa-ter-cress girl.:_ Then her hair it hung in tres-ses, down by the stream that's close to the mill; She was gath-'ring wa-ter-cres-ses, was Mar-tha the wa-ter-cress girl.
W:One day I took a ramble down by a running stream
W:Where the water lillies gambol - it was a lovely scene
W:And there I saw a maiden, a maiden from the dell:
W:She was gath'ring watercresses  'twas Martha the watercress girl.

W:Chorus:

W:Then her hair it hung in tresses, down by the stream that's close to the mill;
W:She was gath'ring watercresses, was Martha the watercress girl.

W:I asked if she was lonely, she answered with a smile:
W:'Kind sir, I am not lonely, for here I daily toil.
W:I have to rise up early my cresses for to sell:
W:My Christian name is Martha - they call me the watercress girl'
W:
W:The day is not far distant when Martha will be mine,
W:And on our wedding morning it will be nice and fine.
W:I'll have to rise up early and dress up like an earl,
W:To go and marry Martha, the sweet little watercress girl.
