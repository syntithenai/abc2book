w:hounds__That caused me from my coun-try to fly_
W:Most gentlemen take great delight
W:In hunting bold Reynard the Fox
W:Twas by Gaffer Ghylls I did lie
W:Where I lived upon fat geese and ducks
W:Twas by Gaffer Ghylls I did lie
W:Not thinking how soon I should die
W:I was chased by a pack of fresh hounds
W:That caused me from my country to fly
W:
W:Twas by Gaffer Ghylls I did lie
W:And I lived at a plentiful rate
W:Young lambs I plucked on their bones
W:And the farmers 'gan for me to hate
W:Lord Jones for the king's hounds did send
W:Tommy Bosun he swore I should die
W:And I left three brothers behind me
W:That loves young lambs far better than I
W:
W:It's forty long miles I rambled
W:And I done it in three hours space
W:It made my old coat stand on end
W:As the hounds followed on me apace
W:For it's oftentimes I've been pursued
W:By hounds that would run like a cow
W:But in the whole course of my lifetime
W:Never had such a breathing till now
W:
W:By Simon Sturt's I did ramble
W:Where the gamekeeper shot through my thigh
W:Oh pardon dear huntsmen and hounds
W:But from this fatal wound I must die
W:My old coat it lay close to my back
W:To hear how the hounds they did hollo
W:My sweat dropped like dew in the morning
W:For to hear how the huntsmen did follow
W:
W:It was in Stony Fields where they killed me
W:Oh the blood-thirsty hounds how they follow
W:They tore my old jacket to pieces
W:Good Lord how the huntsmen did hollo!
W:And now that bold Reynard is ended
W:To the tavern they'll go down to dine
W:They'll dip my fore-paw in a bumper
W:And they'll drink their lord's health in good wine
