%% Lucille Reilly (the Dulcimer Lady!) and I
%% recently played some dances down in the garden State and at the
%% summit Church in Philly. We had a real fine time, and I was
%% very pleased to meet her nice husband, Dave Rewick, when they
%% so kindly put me up for the night. I bet you won't have a problem finding
%% someone to play this tune for you, Dave!  Thanks again to you both for your
%% hospitality.
