N:The A section is from  "The Toy Parade," composed by David Kahn, Melvyn Leonard, and Mort Greene. The music seemed to be a kind of answer, if not an inversion, to Charles  Gounoud's 1872 composition, "Funeral for a Marionette," adapted as the equally familiar theme to television's Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The statement above is quoted from wikipedia and I found it on Feb. 18 2007. I apparently was not the only one to notice these two themes fit together.
