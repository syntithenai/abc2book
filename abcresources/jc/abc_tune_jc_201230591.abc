%% Recently, Doug
%% Creighton on Button Box, Ethan Allen-Watkins
%% on fiddle, and I on piano played a dance together
%% in Peterborough. Steve Zaken-Anderson was the
%% caller, and it was a great night. Doug and Ethan
%% were a wonderful matched pair, and I thought their
%% music was spectacular. Doug can really push those
%% buttons!
