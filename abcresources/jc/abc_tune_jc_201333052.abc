w: Though_ he was the world to me.*
W:He came from his palace grand,
W:And he came to my cottage door;
W:His words were few, but his looks
W:Will linger forevermore.
W:The smile in his sad dark eyes,
W:More tender than words could be;
W:But I was nothing to him,
W:Though he was the world to me;
W:But I was nothing to him,
W:Though he was the world to me.
W:
W:And there in his garden strolled,
W:All robed in satins and lace,
W:A lady so strange and cold,
W:Who held in his heart no place.
W:For I would be his bride
W:With a kiss for a lifetime fee;
W:But I am nothing to him,
W:Though he is the world to me;
W:But I am nothing to him,
W:Though he is the world to me.
W:
W:Today in his palace grand
W:On a flower-strewn bier he lies,
W:With the beautiful lids fast closed
W:O'er the beautiful sad dark eyes.
W:Among the mourners who mourn
W:Why should I a mourner be?
W:For I was nothing to him
W:Though he was the world to me.
W:
W:How will it be with our souls
W:When we meet in that spirit land?
W:What the mortal heart ne'er knows
W:Will the spirit then understand?
W:Or in some celestial form
W:Will our sorrows repeated be?
W:Will I still be nothing to him
W:Though he is the world to me?
W:Will I still be nothing to him
W:Though he is the world to me?
