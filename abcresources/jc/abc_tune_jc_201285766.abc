W:
W:There were three brothers in Merry Scotland,
W:In Merry Scotland there were three,
W:And they did cast lots which of them should go,
W:should go, should go,
W:And turn robber all on the salt sea.
W:
W:The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
W:The youngest of all the three,
W:That he should turn robber all on the salt sea,
W:the salt sea, the salt sea,
W:For to maintain his two brothers and he.
W:
W:They had not been sailing for but a long Winter's night,
W:And part of the short Winter's day,
W:When he espied a stout lofty ship,
W:lofty ship, lofty ship,
W:Come abibbing down on him straight way.
W:
W:"Hello, hello," cried Henry Martin,
W:"What makes you sail so nigh?"
W:"I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London town,
W:London town, London town,
W:Would you please for to let me pass by?"
W:
W:"Oh no, oh no," cried Henry Martin,
W:"This thing could never be,
W:for I have turned robber all on the salt sea,
W:the salt sea, the salt sea,
W:For to maintain my two borthers and me."
W:
W:"Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizzen,
W:Bring your ship under my lee
W:Or I will give you a full cannon ball,
W:cannon ball, cannon ball,
W:And all you dead bodies drown in the salt sea."
W:
W:"Oh no, we won't lower our lofty topsail,
W:Nor bring our ship under your lee
W:And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods,
W:merchant goods, merchant goods,
W:Nor point our bold guns to the sea."
W:
W:And broadside and broadside and at it they went
W:For fully two hours or three,
W:Till Henry Martin gave to them the death shot,
W:death shot, death shot,
W:And straight to the bottom went she."
W:
W:Bad news, bad news to old England came,
W:Bad news to fair London town,
W:There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away,
W:cast away, cast away,
W:And all of her merry men drowned.
