W:     Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow;
W:   Busk ye, busk ye, my bonny bride;
W:     Think nae mair on the Braes of Yarrow.
W:   Where, where gat ye that bonny bride?
W:     Where, where gat ye that winsome marrow?
W:   'Twas where I daur nae weel be seen,
W:     By the birks on the Braes of Yarrow.
W:
W: 2.Weep not, weep not, my bonny bride,
W:     Weep not, weep not, my winsome marrow,
W:   Nor let thy heart lament to leave
W:     The birks upon the Braes of Yarrow.
W:   Why does she weep, thy bonny bride?
W:     Why does she weep, thy winsome marrow?
W:   And why daur ye nae weel be seen
W:     By the birks on the Braes of Yarrow?
W:
W: 3.Lang maun she weep, lang maun she weep,
W:     Lang maun she weep wi' dule and sorrow,
%page 274
W:   And lang maun I nae mair be seen
W:     By the birks on the Braes of Yarrow:
W:   For she has tint her luver dear,
W:     Her luver dear, the cause of sorrow,
W:   And I hae slain the comeliest youth
W:     By the birks on the Braes of Yarrow,
W:
W: 4.Why runs thy stream, O Yarrow, red?
W:     Why on thy braes the voice of sorrow?
W:   And why yon melancholious weeds,
W:     Hung on the bonny birks of Yarrow?
W:   What's yonder on the rueful stream?
W:     What yonder floats? O dule and sorrow!
W:   'Tis he, the comely swain I slew
W:     Upon the duleful Braes of Yarrow.
W:
W: 5.Wash ye, O wash his wounds in tears,
W:     His wounds in. tears with dule and sorrow,
W:   And wrap his limbs in mourning weeds,
W:     And lay him on the Braes of Yarrow.
W:   Then build, then build, ye sisters sad,
W:     Ye sisters sad, his tomb with sorrow,
W:   And weep around in waefu' wise.
W:     Weep his fate on the Braes of Yarrow.
W:
W: 6:Curse ye, curse ye his useless shield,
W:     My arm that wrought the deed of sorrow,
%page 275
W:   The fatal spear that pierc'd his breast,
W:     His breast upon the Braes of Yarrow!
W:   Did I not warn thee not to lu'e,
W:     And warn from fight? but, to my sorrow,
W:   O'er rashly bold, a stronger arm
W:     Thou met'st, upon the Braes of Yarrow*
W:
W: 7.Sweet smells the birk, green grows the grass;
W:     Yellow on Yarrow banks the gowan,
W:   Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,
W:     And sweet the wave of Yarrow flowan,
W:   Flows Yarrow sweet? as sweet flows Tweed,
W:     As green its grass, its gowan yellow;
W:   As sweet smells on its braes the birk,
W:     The apple frae the rock as mellow.
W:
W: 8.Fair was thy luve, fair fair thy luve;
W:     In flow'ry bands thou him didst fetter;
W:   Though he was weel beluv'd again,
W:     Than me he never lu'ed thee better.
W:   Busk ye, then busk, my bonny bride,
W:     Busk ye, busk ye, my winsome marrow,
W:   And lu'e me on the banks of Tweed;
W:     Think nae mair on the Braes of Yarrow.
W:
W: 9.How can I busk a bonny bride?
W:     How can I busk a winsome marrow?
%page 276
W:   How lu'e thee on the banks of Tweed,
W:     That slew him on the Braes of Yarrow?
W:   O Yarrow fields, may never rain
W:     Nor dew thy tender blossoms cover;
W:   For there was basely slain my luve,
W:     My luve, as he'd ne'er been a luver.
W:
W:10.The boy put on his robes of green,
W:     His purple vest, 'twas my own sewing;
W:   Ah, wretched me! I little kend
W:     He was in these to meet his ruin.
W:   The boy took out his milk-white steed,
W:     Unheedful of my dule and sorrow,
W:   But ere the toofal of the night,
W:     Lay slain upon the Braes of Yarrow!
W:
W:11.Much I rejoiced, that waeful day;
W:     I sang, my voice the woods returning;
W:   But lang ere night the spear was flown,
W:     That slew my luve, and left me mourning!
W:   What can my barb'rous father do,
W:     But with unfeeling rage pursue me?
W:   My luver's blood is on thy spear,
W:     How canst thou, cruel man, then woo me?
W:
W:12.My happy sisters, in their pride,
W:     With bitter and ungentle scoffin.
%page 277
W:   May bid me seek, on Yarrow Braes,
W:     My luver nailed in his coffin.
W:   My brother Douglas may upbraid,
W:     And try with threat'ning words to move me;
W:   My luver's blood is on thy spear;
W:     How canst thou ever bid me luve thee?
W:
W:13.Yes, yes, prepare the bed of love;
W:     With bridal sheets my body cover;
W:   Unbar, ye bridal maids, the door,
W:     Let in th' expected husband luver.
W:   But who th' expected husband is?
W:     His hands, methinks, are bath'd in slaughter;
W:   Ah me ! what ghastly spectre's yon,
W:     Comes in his pale shroud, bleeding after?
W:
W:14.Pale as he is, here lay him down,
W:     O lay his cold head on my pillow;
W:   Take off, take off these bridal weeds,
W:     And crown my careful head with willow.
W:   Pale though thou art, yet best beluv'd,
W:     O could my warmth to life restore thee!
W:   Yet lie all night between my breasts,
W:     No youth lay ever there before thee.
W:
W:15.Pale, pale indeed, O luvely youth,
W:     Forgive, forgive so foul a slaughter!
%page 278
W:   And lie all night between my breasts;
W:     No youth shall ever lie there after.
W:   Return, return, O mournful bride,
W:     Return and dry thy useless sorrow;
W:   Thy luver heeds nought of thy sighs;
W:     He lies slain on the Braes of Yarrow.

W:  They'll ne'er make a tempest like that in my mind;
W:  Tho' loudest of thunders on louder waves roar,
W:  That's naething like leaving my love on the shore.
W:  To leave thee behind me my heart is sair pain'd;
W:  But by ease that's inglorious no fame can be gain'd;
W:  And beauty and love's the reward of the brave;
W:  And I maun deserve it before I can crave.
W:
W:3.Then glory, my Jeany, maun plead my excuse;
W:  Since honour commands me, how can I refuse?
W:  Without it, I ne'er can have merit for thee,
W:  And losing thy favour I'd better not be.
W:  I gae, then, my lass, to win glory and fame,
W:  And if I should chance to come gloriously hame,
W:  I'll bring a heart to thee with love running o'er,
W:  And then I'll leave thee and Lochaber no more.

W:   Bid hir cum to the gude grene wode,
W:     And bring nane but her lain:

W: 6.Yes, I will gae zour black errand,
W:   Tho' it be to zour cost ;
W:   Sen ze by me will nae be warn'd,
W:   In it ze sall find frost.
%page 245

W:     Set down his feet and ran.
W:
W: 8.And when he cam to Barnard's ha'.

W:   The lady stamped wi' hir foot,
W:     And winked wi' hir ee;
W:   Bot a' that she could say or do,
W:     Forbidden he wad nae be.
W:
W:11.It's surely to my bow'r-woman;
W:     It neir could be to me.
W:   I brought it to Lord Barnard's lady;
W:     I trow that ze be she.
W:   Then up and spack the wylie nurse,
W:     (The bairn upon her knee),
W:   If it be cum from Gil Morrice,
W:     It's dear welcum to me.
W:
W:12.Ze lied, ze lied, ze filthy nurse,

W:   I brought it to Lord Barnard's lady;
W:     I trow ze be nae she.
%page 247
W:   Then up and spack the bauld baron,
W:     An angr y man was he;
W:   He's tain the table wi' his loot,
W:     Sae has he wi' his knee,
W:   Till silver cup and ezar dish
W:     In flinders he gard flee.
W:
W:13.Gae bring a robe o' zour cliding,
W:     That hings upon the pin;
W:   And I'll gae to the gude grene wode,
W:     And speik wi' zour lemman.
W:   O bide at hame, now, Lord Barnard,
W:     I ward ze bide at hame;
W:   Neir wyte a man for violence,
W:     That neir wyte ze wi' nane.
W:
W:14.Gil Morrice sat in gude grene wode,
W:     He whistled and he sang:
W:   O what means a' the folk coming?
W:     My mother tarries lang.
W:   His hair was like the threds o' gowd,
W:     Drawn from Minerva's loome;
W:   His lips like roses drapplng dew,
W:     His breath was a perfume.
W:
W:15.His brow was like the mountain snaw.
W:     Gilt by the morning beam:
%page 248
W:   His cheiks like living roses glow:
W:     His een like azure stream.
W:   The boy was clad in robes of grene,
W:     Sweet as the infant spring:
W:   And like the mavis on the bush,
W:     He gart the vallies ring.
W:
W:16.The baron cam to the grene wode,
W:     Wi' muckle dule and care,
W:   And there he first spied Gil Morrice,
W:     Kaiming his zellow hair,
W:   That sweetly waved round his face,
W:     That face beyond compare:
W:   He sang sae sweet, it might dispel
W:     A' rage but fell despair.
W:
W:17.Nae wonder, nae wonder, Gil Morrice,
W:     My lady loed thee weel:
W:   The fairest part of my body
W:     Is blacker than thy heel.
W:   Zet zier-the-less now, Gil Morrice,
W:     For a* thy great bewty,
W:   Ze's rew the day ze eir was born;
W:     That head sall gae wi' me.
W:
W:18.Now he has drawn his trusty brand,
W:     And slaited on the strae;
%page 249
W:   And thro' Gil Morrice' fair body
W:     He's gard cauld iron gae.
W:   And he has tain Gil Morrice' head,
W:     And set it on a speir:
W:   The meanest man in a' his train
W:     Has gotten that head to bear.
W:
W:19.And he has tain Gil Morrice up,
W:     Laid him across his steid,
W:   And brought him to his painted bow'r,
W:     And laid him on a bed.
W:   The lady sat on castil wa',
W:     Beheld baith dale and doun,
W:   And there she saw Gil Morrice' head
W:     Cum trailing to the toun.
W:
W:20.Far better I loe that bluidy head,
W:     Bot and that zellow hair,
W:   Than Lord Barnard and a' his lands,
W:     As they lig here and thair.
W:   And she has tain her Gil Morrice,
W:     And kiss'd baith mouth and chin:
W:   I was ance as fow o' Gil Morrice
W:     As the hip is o' the stane.
W:
W:21.I got ze in my father's house,
W:     Wi' mickle sin and shame;
%page 250
W:   I brocht ze up in gude grene wode,
W:     Under the heavy rain.
W:   Oft have I by thy cradle sat,
W:     And fondly seen thee sleip;
W:   But now I'll gae about thy grave,
W:     The saut teirs for to weip.
W:
W:22.And syne she kiss'd his bluidy cheik,
W:     And syne his bluidy chin:
W:   O better I loe my Gil Morrice
W:     Than a' my kith and kin!
W:   Away, away, ze ill woman,
W:     And an ill deith may ze dee!
W:   Gin I had kend he'd been zour son,
W:     He'd neir been slain for me.
W:
W:23.Obraid me not, my Lord Barnard!
W:     Obraid me not for shame!
W:   Wi' that same spier, O pierce my heart.
W:     And put me out o' pain.
W:   Since naething but Gil Morrice' head
W:     Thy jealous rage could quell,
W:   Let that saim hand now tack hir life.
W:     That neir to thee did ill.
W:
W:24.To me nae after days nor nichts
W:     Will eir prove true or kind;
%page 251
W:   I'll fill the air with heavy sighs.
W:     And greet till I am blind.
W:   Enouch o' bluid by me's bin spilt,
W:     Seek not zour death frae me;
W:   I rather it had bin mysel,
W:     Than eather him or thee.
W:
W:25.Wi' waefou wae I hear zour plaint;
W:     Sair, sair I rew the deid,
W:   That eir this cursed hand o' mine
W:     Had gard his body bleid.
W:   Dry up zour tears, my winsom dame,
W:     Ze neir can heal the wound;
W:   Ze see his head upon the speir,
W:     His heart's bluid on the ground.
W:
W:26.I curse the hand that did the deid,
W:     The heart that thocht the ill,
W:   The feit that bore me wi' sic speid,
W:     The comely zouth to kill.
W:   I'll ay lament for Gil Morrice,
W:     As gin he were my ain;
W:   I'll neir forget the dreiry day,
W:     On which the zouth was slain.

W:    That gild the passing shower,

W:    When feather'd pairs are courting,
W:  And little lambkins wanton wild,
W:    In playful bands disporting.
W:
W:3.Were Fortune lovely Peggy's foe,
W:    Such sweetness would relent her;
W:  As blooming spring unbends the brow
W:    Of surly, savage winter.
W:  Detraction's eye no aim can gain
W:    Her winning pow'rs to lessen,
W:  And spiteful Envy grins in vain
W:    The poison'd tooth to fasten.
W:

W:    From ev'ry ill defend her;
W:  Inspire the highly-favour'd youth
W:    The destinies intend her.
W:  Still fan the sweet connubial flame,
W:    Responsive in each bosom,
W:  And bless the dear parental name
W:    With many a filial blossom.

W: 2.Lord Thomas said a word in jest,

W:     "And let fair Annet be?"
W:
W: 7."The nut-browne bride has oxen, brither,
W:     "The nut-browne bride has kye;

W:   And he has gane into the bower
W:     Wherein fair Annet lay.
W:
W:13."Rise up, rise up, fair Annet, he says,"
W:     "Put on your silken sheene
W:   "Let us gae to Saint Marie's kirk,
W:     "And see that rich wedden."
W:
W:14."My maids, gae to my dressing-room,

W:18.Four-and-twenty gay gude knights
W:     Rade by fair Annet's side,
W:   And four-and-twenty fair ladies,
W:     As gin she'd been a bride.
W:
W:19.And when she cam to Marie's kirke,
W:     She sat on Marie's stane;
W:   The cleading that fair Annet had on,
W:     It skinkled in their een.
W:
W:20.And when she cam into the kirke,
W:     She skimmer'd like the sun;
W:   The belt that was aboute her waist
W:     Was a' wi' pearles bedone.
W:
W:21.She sat her by the nut-browne bride,
W:     And her een they were sae clear,
W:   Lord Thomas he quite forgat the bride.
W:     When fair Annet drew near.
W:
W:22.He had a rose into his hand,
W:     He gae it kisses three,
%page 207
W:   And, reaching by the nut-browne bride..
W:     Laid it on fair Annet's knee.
W:

W:   "And whare gat ye that rose-water
W:     "That does mak ye sae white?"
W:
W:24."O, I did get that rose-water

W:     "Into my mither's wame."
W:
W:25.The bride she drew a lang bodkin
W:     Frae out her grey head-gear,
W:   And strack fair Annet into the heart,
W:     That word she ne'er spak mair.
W:
W:26.Lord Thomas saw fair Annet wax pale,
W:     And marvelit what mote be;
W:   But when he saw her dear heart's blude,
W:     A' wood wroth waxed he.
W:
W:27.He drew his dagger that was sae sharp,
W:     That was sae sharp and meit,
W:   And drave it into the nut-browne bride
W:     That fell deid at his feit.
%page 208
W:
W:28."Now stay for me, dear Annet,"he said,
W:     "Now stay, my dear," he cry'd;
W:   Then strack the dagger intil his heart,
W:     And fell deid by her side.
W:
W:29.Lord Thomas was bury'd without kirk-wa',
W:     Fair Annet within the quiere ;
W:   And o' the tane there grew a birk,
W:     The ither a bonny briere.
W:

W: 2.Na, Patie; O wha's tell'd you that?
W:     I think that o' news they've been scanty,
W:   That I should be married sae soon,
W:     Or yet should hae been sae flanty:
W:   I winna be married the year,
W:     Suppose I were courted by twenty;
W:   Sae, Patie, ye need nae mair spier,
W:     For weel a wat I dinna want ye.

W: 3.Now, Maggy, what maks ye sae sweer?
W:     Is't 'cause that I hae na a mailen?
W:   The lad that has plenty o' gear
W:     Need ne'er want a hauf nor a hale ane.
W:   My dad has a gude grey mare,
W:     And yours has twa cows and a filly?
W:   And that will be plenty o' gear,
W:     Sae, Maggy, be na sae ill-willy.
W:
W: 4.Indeed, Patie, I dinna ken,
W:     But first ye maun spier at my daddy;
W:   You're as weel born as Ben,
W:     And I canna say but I'm ready:
W:   There's plenty o' yarn on the clues,
W:     To mak me a coat and a jimpy,
W:   And plaiden eneugh to be trews,
W:     Gif I get ye, I shanna scrimp ye.
W:
W: 5.Now fair fa' ye, my bonny Meg,
W:     I'se let a wee smacky fa' on you;
W:   May my neck be as lang as my leg,
W:     If I be an ill husband to you;
W:   Sae gang your way hame e'now,
W:     Mak ready gin this day fifteen days,
W:   And tell your father the news,
W:     That I'll be his son in great kindness.

W:
W: 6.It was nae lang after that,
W:     Wha cam to our bigging but Patie,
W:   Weel drest in a braw new coat,
W:     And vow but he thought himsel pretty;
W:   His bannet was little frae new,
W:     In it was a loop and a slitty,
W:   To tie in a ribbon sae blue,
W:     To bab at the neck o' his coaty.
W:
W: 7.Then Patie cam in wi' a sten',
W:     Said, Peace be here to the bigging.
W:   You're welcome, quo' William, come ben,
W:     Or I wish it may rive frae the rigging:
W:   Now draw in your seat and sit down,
W:     And tell's a' your news in a hurry,
W:   And haste ye, Meg, and be done,
W:     And hing on the pan wi' the berry.
W:
W: 8.Quo' Patie, my news is nae thrang;
W:     Yestreen I was wi' his Honour;
W:   I've ta'en three rigs o' braw land,
W:     And hae bound mysel under a honour:
W:   And now my errand to you
W:     Is for Maggy to help me to labour;
W:   I think ye maun gie's the best cow,
W:     Because that our hadden's but sober.

W:
W: 9.Weel, now for to help ye through,
W:     I'll be at the cost o' the bridal;
W:   I'se cut the craig o' the ewe
W:     That had amaist died o' the side-ill;
W:   And that will be plenty o' bree,
W:     Sae lang as our weel is nae reisted,
W:   To a' the gude neighbours and we,
W:     And I think we'll no be that ill feasted.
W:
W:10.Quo' Patie, O that'll do weel,
W:     And I'll gie you brose i' the morning,
W:   O' kail that was made yestreen,
W:     For I like them best in the forenoon.
W:   Sae Tam, the piper, did play,
W:     And ilka ane danc'd that was willing,
W:   And a' the lave they ranked through,
W:     And they held the stoupy ay filling.
W:
W:11.The auld wives sat and they chew'd;
W:     And when that the carles grew nappy,
W:   They danc'd as weel as they dow'd,
W:     Wi' a crack o' their thumbs, and a kappie.
W:   The lad that wore the white band,
W:     I think they ca'd him Jamie Mather,
W:   And he took the bride by the hand,
W:     And cry'd to play up Maggie Lauder.

W:2.I've wanted a sark for these eight years and ten,
W:    And this was to be the beginning o't;
W:  But I vow I shall want it for as lang again,
W:    Or ever I try the spinning o't.
W:  For never, since ever they ca'd me's they ca' me,
W:  Did sic a mishap and mishanter befa' me;
W:  Ye shall hae leave baith to hang me and draw me,
W:    If ever I try the spinning o't.
W:
W:3.I hae kept a house for these threescore o' years,
W:    And never did try the spinning o't;
W:  But how I was sacked, foul fa' them that spiers,
W:    It minds me upo' the beginning o't.
%page 140
W:  But women are now-a-days turned sae braw,
W:  That ilk ane maun hae a sark, some maun hae twa,
W:  The warld was better when the fient ane ava,
W:    To hinder the first beginning o't.
W:
W:4.Foul fa' them that ever advis'd me to spin,
W:    That had been sae lang o' beginning o't;
W:  I weel might hae ended as I did begin,
W:    Nor got sic a fear wi' the spinning o't:
W:  But they say she's a wise wife wha kens her ain weird;
W:  I thought ance on a day it wad never been spier'd,
W:  How loot ye the low tak the rock by the beard,
W:    When ye gade to try the spinning o't?
W:
W:5.The spinning, the spinning, it gars my heart sab,
W:    When I think upon the beginning o't;
W:  I thought ere I died to have made me a wab,
W:    But still I had weirs o' the spinning o't.
W:  But had I nine daughters, as I hae but three,
W:  The safest and soundest advice I wad gie,
W:  Is that they frae spinning wad keep their hands free,
W:    For fear of a bad beginning o't.
W:
W:6.Yet in spite of my counsel, if they will needs run
W:    The drearysome task o' the spinning o't,
W:  Let them seek a lown place in the heat o' the sun,
W:    And there venture on the beginning o't.
%page 141
W:  But to do as I did, alas and avow!
W:  To busk up my rock by the cheek o' the low,
W:  Some may say that I had little wit in my pow,
W:    And as little to do wi' the spinning o't.
W:
W:7.But yet, after a', there is ae thing that grieves
W:    My heart, to think on the beginning o't;
W:  Had I won but the length o' ae pair o' sleeves,
W:    Then there wad been word o' the spinning o't:
W:  Then I'd hae twa washin' and bleached like snaw.
W:  And on my twa gardies like muggons to draw,
W:  And then fouk wad say that auld Grizzy was braw,
W:    And a' was upon her ain spinning o't.
W:
W:8.But gin I wad shog about till a new spring,
W:    I should yet hae a bout o' the spinning o't;
W:  A mutchkin o' lintseed I'd in the yird fling,
W:      For a' the wanchancie beginning o't.
W:  I'll gar my ain Tammie gang down to the howe,
W:  And cut me a rock o' the withershins grow,
W:  O' gude rantry-tree, for to carry my tow,
W:  And a spindle o' the same for the twining o't.
W:
W:9.For now when I mind me, I met Maggy Grim,
W:    That morning, just at the beginning o't;
W:  She was ne'er ca'd chancy, but unlucky and slim,
W:    And sae it has far'd o' my spinning o't.
%page 142
W:  But gin my new rock were ance cutted and dry,
W:  Ise a' Maggy's can and her cantrips defy,
W:  And, but ony soothing, the spinning I'll try,
W:    And yese a' hear o' the beginning o't.
W:
W:10.Quo' Tibby her daughter, tak tent what ye say,
W:    The never a rag we'll be seeking o't;
W:  Gin ye ance begin, ye'll traverse night and day,
W:    Sae it's vain ony mair to be speaking o't.
W:  Since Lammas I'm now gane thirty and twa,
W:  And ne'er a dud sark had I yet, great or sma',
W:  And what waur am I? I'm as warm and as braw
W:    As thrummmy-tail'd Meg, that's a spinner o't.
W:
W:11.To labour lint land, and then buy the seed,
W:    And then to yoke me to the harrowing o't,
W:  And syne hobble amang't, and pick out ilka weed,
W:    Like a swine in a sty, at the farrowing o't:
W:  Syne bowing, and rippling, and steeping, and then
W:  To gar's gae and spread it upon the cauld plain;
W:  And then, after a', maybe labour in vain,
W:    When the wind and the weet gets the fushon o't.
W:
W:12.But though it should happen the weather to bide,
W:    Wi' beetles we're set to the drubbing o't;
W:  And then frae our fingers to gudge a' the hide,
W:    Wi' the wearisome wark o' the spinning o't.
%page 143
W:  And syne ilka tait maun be heckled out-through,
W:  The lint putten ae gate, anither the tow,
W:  Sjne on a rock with it, and it taks a low:
W:    The back o' my hand to the spinning o't.
W:
W:13.Quo' Jenny, I think, woman, ye're in the right,
W:    Set your feet a-spar to the spinning o't;
W:  We may tak our advice frae our ain mither's fright,
W:    That she gat when she tried the spinning o't.
W:  But they'll say that auld fouk are twice bairns indeed,
W:  And sae has she kyth'd it, but there is nae need,
W:  To sic an amshah that we drive out o' head,
W:    As lang's we're sae scar'd frae the spinning o't,
W:
W:14.Quo' Nancy the youngest, I've now heard you a%
W:    And dowy's your doom o' the spinning o't;
W:  Gin ye fan, the cow flings, the cog's cast awa,
W:    Ye may see where ye'll lick up your winning o't.
W:  But I see that by spinning ye'll never be braw.
W:  But gae by the name o' a dilp or a daw;
W:  But lick where ye like, I shall ance shake a fa',
W:    Afore I be dung wi' the spinning o't.
W:
W:15.For weel can I mind me, when black Willie Bell
W:    Had Tibbie there, just at the winning o't,
W:  What blew up the bargain, she kens weel hersel,
W:    Was the want o' the knack o' the spinning o't,
%page 144
W:  And now, poor woman, for ought that I ken,
W:  She never may get sic an offer again,
W:  But pine awa, bit and bit, like Jenkin's hen,
W:    And naething to wyte but the spinning o't.
W:
W:16.But were it for naething but just that alane,
W:    I shall yet hae a bout at the spinning o't;
W:  They may cast me, and e'en ca' me black at the bane,
W:    But no 'cause I shunn'd the beginning o't.
W:  But be that as it happens, I carena a strae,
W:  For nane o' the lads e'er shall hae it to say,
W:  When he comes to woo, she kens naething ava,
W:    Nor has ony can at the spinning o't.
W:
W:17.It's needless for us to tak our remarks
W:    Frae our mither's miscooking the spinning o't;
W:  She never kend ought o' the gude o' the sarks,
W:    Frae this, a' back to the spinning o't.
W:  Three ell o' plaiding was a' that was sought
W:  By our auld waly bodies, and that boot be bought,
W:  For in ilka town sickan things were na wrought,

W:  For when we were married our cleedin was thin,
W:  And poortith, ye ken, made me eydent to spin;

W:  But thrift and industry maks poor fouk to thrive,
W:    A clear proof o' that is the spinning o't.

W:    And heartless and hard the beginning o't,
W:  When ye was engaged the ousen to ca',
W:    And first my young skill tried the spinning o't:

W:2.It's now ten at night, and the stars gie nae light,
W:    And the bells they ring, ding dong;
W:  He's met wi' some delay, that causeth him to stay,
W:    But he will be here ere long.

W:3.The surly auld carle did naething but snarl,
W:    And Johnny's face it grew red;
W:  Yet tho' he often sigh'd, he ne'er a word reply'd,
W:    Till all were asleep in bed.
W:
W:4.Up Johnny rose, and to the door he goes,
W:    And gently tirled the pin:
W:  The lassie taking tent, unto the door she went,
W:    Then open'd and let him in.
W:
W:5.And are ye come at last, and do I hold ye fast?
W:    And is my Johnny true?
W:  I hae nae time to tell, but sae lang's I like mysel
W:    Sae lang shall I love you.
W:
W:6.Flee up, flee up, my bonny grey cock,
W:    And craw when it is day;
W:  Your neck shall be like the bonny beaten gold,
W:    And your wings of the silver grey.
W:
W:7.The cock prov'd fause, and untrue he was,
W:    For he crew an hour o'er soon:
W:  The lassie thought it day when she sent her love away,
W:    And it was but a blink of the moon.

%page 80
W:  I thought upon the banks o' Coil,
W:    I thought upon my Nancy,
W:  I thought upon her witching smile,
W:    That caught my youthfu' fancy.
W:
W:3.At length I reach'd the bonny glen,
W:    Where early life I sported,
W:  I pass'd the mill and trysting thorn,
W:    Where Nancy oft I courted.
W:  Wha spied I but mine ain dear maid,
W:    Down by her mother's dwelling!
W:  And turn'd me round to hide the flood
W:    That in my een was swelling.
W:
W:4.Wi' alter'd voice, quoth I, Sweet lass,
W:    Sweet as yon hawthorn blossom,
W:  O ! happy, happy may he be
W:    That's dearest to thy bosom!
W:  My purse is light, I've far to gang,
W:    Fain wad I be thy lodger;
W:  I've serv'd my king and country lang,
W:    Tak pity on a sodger.
W:
W:5.Sae wistfully she gaz'd on me,
W:    And lovelier grew than ever;
W:  Quoth she, A sodger ance I lo'ed,
W:    Forget him I shall never.

W:  Our humble cot, and namely fare,
W:    Ye freely shall partake o't:
W:  That gallant badge, the dear cockade,
W:    Ye're welcome for the sake o't.
W:
W:6.She gaz'd--she redden'd like a rose,
W:    Syne, pale like ony lily,
W:  She sunk within my arms, and cried,
W:    Art thou mine ain dear Willie?
W:  By him who made yon sun and sky,
W:    By whom true love's regarded,
W:  I am the man!--and thus may still
W:    True lovers be rewarded.
W:
W:7.The wars are o'er, and I'm come hame,
W:    And find thee still true-hearted;
W:  Though poor in gear, we're rich in love,
W:    And, mair, we'se ne'er be parted.
W:  Quo' she, My grandsire left me gowd,
W:    A mailin plenish'd fairly;
W:  Come then, my faithfu' sodger lad,
W:    Thou'rt welcome to it dearly.
W:
W:8.For gold the merchant ploughs the main,
W:    The farmer ploughs the manor;
W:  But glory is the sodger's prize;
W:    The sodger's wealth is honour,

W:  The brave poor sodger ne'er despise,

W: Alas! for I lo'ed her owre well,
