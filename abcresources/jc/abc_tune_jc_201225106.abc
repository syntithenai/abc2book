%% Robin Slieth is the other half of that
%% dynamic duo of twin boys I told you about in Connor's Tune; their
%% folks are Mary Des Roziers and Rod Slieth, and they are great kids.
%% I'm so glad you and Connor each have your own tune, Robin -
%% perhaps some day I'll see you both on the floor in Nelson dancing to them!
