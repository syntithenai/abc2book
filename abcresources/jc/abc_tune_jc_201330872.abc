W:Robin he married a wife in the West,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:And she turned out to be none of the best,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:When she rises she gets up in haste,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:And flies to the cupboard before she is laced,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)

W:She milks her cows but once a week

W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:When she churns she churns in a boot,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:And instead of a cruddle she puts in her foot,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:She puts her cheese upon the shelf
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:And leaves it to turn till it turns of itself,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:It turned of itself and fell on the floor,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:Got up on its feet and ran out of the door,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:It ran till it came to Wakefield Cross,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:And she followed after upon a white horse,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
W:
W:This song it was made for gentlemen,
W:(Moppety, moppety, mono:)
W:If you want any more you must sing it again,
W:(With a high jig jiggety, tops and petticoats,
W:Robin-a-Thrush cries mono.)
