N: This tune is written oddly:  The first two staves both have key and time signatures; the 3rd staff doesn't.
N: Also, the first two staves both end with a fermata, while the 3rd has a "D.C.".  It's as if it's really
N: a 2-strain tune, with the 2nd staff and the bottom voice on staff 3 are a harmony to the 1st staff and 
N: the top voice on staff 3.  Also, the rhythms are messed up at the start of the 3rd staff.
N: Also, there seem to be two different dance descriptions in this tune.
