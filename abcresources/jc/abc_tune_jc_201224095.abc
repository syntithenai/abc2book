%% If you look in
%% Book 3 on Pg.27, you will find "Ernie's Tune", written
%% back in 1978 for my good friend Ernie Spence. He
%% still comes up from Reading, MA, to the Peterborough
%% Dance, and he keeps on being real nice to me, and so
%% anyway, I hope you enjoy dancing to this tune, Ernie,
%% as much as I appreciate your many kindnesses.
