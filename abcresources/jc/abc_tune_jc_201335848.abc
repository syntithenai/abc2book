W:As I walked out one May morning
W:One May morning early
W:'Twas there I spied a pretty maid
W:So handsome and so clever
W:
W:	(With my rue, rum, ray,
W:	Fol the riddle ay
W:	Whack fol loora, lido)
W:
W:Her shoes were black, her stockings white,
W:And her buckles shone like silver;
W:She had a dark and rolling eye
W:And her hair hung down her shoulders.
W:
W:?How old are you, my pretty fair maid,
W:How old are you, my honey??
W:She answered me quite cheerfully,
W:?I am seventeen come Sunday?
W:
W:?Will you marry me, my pretty fair maid,
W:Will you marry me, my honey??
W:She answered me quite cheerfully,
W:?I dare not for my mammy
W:
W:?If you come down to my mammy?s house
W:When the moon is shining brightly,
W:Then I?ll come down and let you in
W:And my mammy will not hear me
W:
W:I went to her mammy?s house
W:When the moon was brightly shining;
W:She came down and let me in,
W:And I lay in her arms till morning
W:
W:?Oh, soldier, will you marry me?
W:For now?s your time or never.
W:Oh, soldier, will you marry me?
W:Or I?m undone for ever?
W:
W:And now she is a soldier?s wife
W:And sails across the brine,
W:?The drum and fife is my delight
W:And a merry man is mine, 0?
