W:There was an old man lived out in the wood,
W:His trade was a cutting of Broom, green Broom;
W:He had but one son without thrift, without good,
W:Who lay in his bed till 'twas noon, bright noon.
W:
W:The old man awoke, one morning and spoke,
W:He swore he would fire the room, that room,
W:If his som John would not rise and open his eyes,
W:And away to the wood to cut Broom, green Broom.
W:
W:So Johnny arose, and he slipped on his clothes,
W:And away to the wood to cut Broom, green Broom,
W:He sharpened his knives, for once he contrives
W:To cut a great bundle of Broom, green Broom.
W:
W:When Johnny passed under a lady's fine house,
W:Passed under a lady's fine room, fine room,
W:She called to her maid, "Go fetch me," she said,
W:"Go fetch me the boy that sells Broom, green Broom.
W:
W:When Johnny came into the lady's fine house,
W:And stood in the lady's fine room, fine room,
W:"Young Johnny," she says, "Will you give up your trade,
W:And marry a lady in bloom, full bloom?"
W:
W:Johnny gave his consent, and to church they both went,
W:And he wedded the lady in bloom, full bloom.
W:At market and fair, all folks do declare,
W:There is none like the boy that sold Broom, green Broom.
