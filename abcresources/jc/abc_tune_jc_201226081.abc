%% Two days before I wrote this tune,
%% the phone rang and it was one of my former school boys who is in the Navy
%% calling me up just to say "hello". I said "where are you?" and he said "Puerto Rico."
%% Well, I thought that was a pretty nice thing for Shane Sullivan to do (he's Nicki Noonan's
%% cousin, by the way) and so I thought the least I could do was write him a tune
%% by way of saying "_thanks_" - love to you and to your nice Veronica, Shane -
%% (P.S.- I love my new hat!)
