%% Unforgettable! That's what dancing
%% in Nelson is. You line up on the 
%% north side of the hall at the start of
%% the dance, and you finish 'way
%% over on the south side. Now why do
%% you suppose that is?

%% Note: Bob had this page printed with the staff lines
%% all sloping down slightly to the right, as a subtle
%% hint at what he's talking about. This doesn't work
%% very well in computer transcription, especially ABC
%% which lacks any real positioning fetures. This is
%% one of many examples why you might like to have your
%% own copies of his booklets. I hope they're still
%% in print many years from now (2021 as I type this).
