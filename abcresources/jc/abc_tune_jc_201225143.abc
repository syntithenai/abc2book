%% Janie Orzechowski, who is the
%% fiddler in our new band "Old New England," sent me such a pretty
%% picture post card of this great river up in Newport, NH,
%% that I thought it needed a tune to go with it. So here it
%% is, Janie! (Deanna Stiles plays flute in our band, too; she's out
%% there in a canoe in the picture, but you can't really tell who it is.)
