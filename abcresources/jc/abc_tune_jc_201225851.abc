%%The "Folkway" coffee house is
%% right here in Peterborough, and when you go there for a
%% concert, be sure to go early enough so you can enjoy a nice
%% dinnnr before the music. Davis Barnes does the cooking, and
%% the dinners are delicious. Ask anyone. Ask me! (P.S.- See you
%% soon, Davis - love that swordfish!!)
