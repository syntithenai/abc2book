%% You know those nice concerts they have during the week at Augusta?
%% (Well, even if you don't know they still have 'em.) Well anyway,
%% do you know who puts them on, who arranges them, who
%% directs them, who makes everybody happy back stage,
%% and makes everybody happy out in FRONT of the stage?
%% Do you know who does all this? Vicki Moss, that's who!
%% Thanks a lot for al your hard work, Vicki - you're awesome!
