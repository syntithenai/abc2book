S:Kilkenny Tavern sessions, London
N:As 'Yellow Hair'd Laddie' it originated as a late 17th
N:century Scottish reel; it first appears on English
N:broadside ballad sheets in the 1790s for a song called
N:'In April, when Primroses Paint the Sweet Plain' [from
N:Bruce Olson].
N:It was published as 'Four Hand Reel' by Elias Howe in
N:'Howe's 1000 Jigs and Reels', Boston, 1867; as an
N:untitled reel in Levey's 'Dance Music of Ireland, 2nd
N:Collection', 1873; and in Ryan's Mammoth Collection of
N:1883.
N:'The Five Mile Chase' seems to have been the name of
N:a dance (a four hand reel, naturally enough) which got
N:attached to the present tune, although O'Neill gives
N:it under other titles; also in Mulvihill.
