O:Barry, JAF, XVIII (1905), pp212 and 49-50, as from
O:"Family Songs compiled by Rosa Allen," 1899, p.14 in
O:whose family, of Medfield, Mass., it had long been traditional.
O:Also in Linscott, 1939, pp. 170-71.
H:The Linscott copy was sung by Lucy Allen, West Newton, Mass.;
learned from her uncle, c. 1870.
Barry connects this tune with "Dunnocht Head" (R.A. Smith, The
Scottish Minstrel, III, p.96), but if perhaps there is a resemblance in
first and last phrases, this does not hold true of the earlier copy in
the SMM, No. 375.
