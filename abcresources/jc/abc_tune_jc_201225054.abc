%% I think the last time
%% I played for Dick Reger was up at Vermong Academy with
%% April and Pete as New England Tradition, but I played for him
%% occasionallyh long before that when I was a member of Ralph's
%% band in the late 40's and early 50's. He is a fine caller and
%% great fun to work for; I've wanted a tune for you for a long
%% while, Dick - I'm so glad this one finally showed up with
%% your name on it!
