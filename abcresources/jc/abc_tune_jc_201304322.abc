w:I o-ver-heard a_ sail-or boy, like_ wise a la-dy_ fair
W:As I walked out one morning
W:In the springtime of the year,
W:I overheard a sailor boy,
W:Likewise his lady fair.
W:
W:They sang a song together,
W:Made the valleys for to ring,
W:While the birds on the spray and the meadows gay,
W:That proclaimed the lovely spring.
W:
W:Said Henry to Nancy,
W:"We must soon sail away,
W:For it's lovely on the water
W:To hear the music play."
W:
W:"For our Queen she do want seamen,
W:So I will not stay on shore.
W:I will brave the wars for my country
W:Where the cannons loudly roar."
W:
W:"Oh", then said pretty Nancy,
W:"Pray stay at home with me,
W:Or let me go along with you
W:To bear you company."
W:
W:"I'll put a pair of trousers
W:And leave my native shore.
W:Then let me go along with you
W:Where the cannons loudly roar."
W:
W:"It will not do", said Henry,
W:"It's vain for you to try.
W:They will not ship a female",
W:Young Henry did reply.
W:
W:"Besides, your hands are delicate,
W:And the ropes would make them sore;
W:And it would be worse if you should fall
W:Where the cannons loudly roar".
W:
W:Poor Nancy fell and fainted,
W:And soon they brought her to;
W:They both shook hands together
W:And took a fond adieu.
W:
W:"Come, change your ring with me, my love,
W:For we may meet once more.
W:There's one above that will guard you, love,
W:Where the cannons loudly roar."
W:
W:"Four pounds it is our bounty,
W:And that would not do for thee
W:For to help thy aged parents while I am on the sea."
W:
W:For Tower Hill is crowded
W:With mothers weeping sore
W:For their sons are gone to face the foe
W:Where the cannons loudly roar.
W:
W:There's many a mother's darling
W:Has entered for the main,
W:And in the dreadful battles
W:What numbers will be slain.
W:
W:For many a weeping mother
W:And widow will deplore
W:For those who fall by cannob balls
W:Where the cannons loudly roar.
