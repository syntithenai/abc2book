W:Sing May, Queen May, sing Mary!
W:'Tis stained with blood like cardinal red.
W:Sing all good men for the new-born Baby!

W:Sing May, Queen May, sing Mary!
W:From Christ's own side, 'tis water and blood,
W:Sing all good men for the new-born Baby!

W:7. Oh hail yon hall where none can sin,
W:Sing May, Queen May, sing Mary!
W:Cause hit's gold outside and silver within,
W:Sing all good men for the new-born Baby!
