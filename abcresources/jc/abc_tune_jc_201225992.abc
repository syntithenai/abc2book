%% A wonderful group of Tom Anderson's
%% Shetland fiddle students and their piano accompanist (Hi Jim!) came to the States
%% this summer, on tour as Shetland's Young Heritage. I first heard them in Nelson, where
%% they were joined by Walt Michael and Company, and the music that night was out of
%% this world. It was a grand evening, and I could just tell that one of the group, Miss
%% Valerie Nicolson, badly needed a waltz! So here it is, Valerie, with much love from Bob.
%% "Will ye no come back again?" I sure hope so!
