T:Hanged Man's Reel
S:irtrad-l, 8/94,Edward A Beimborn
D:Aly Bain Version from "Far From Home"
H:It's originally a French-Canadian tune, called "Le Reel du Pendu", so
H:it is indeed the Hanged Man's Reel, rather than the Hangman's reel. Jean
H:Carignan recorded it in a couple of places--with clogging--and I suspect
H:his is the definitive version, in the sense that the others got it from
H:him, either directly or indirectly. It's a wild tune the way he plays it:
H:there is _lots_ going on: intricate use of drone strings and/or
H:double-stopping, (none of which is reproduced in the Fiddler's Fakebook,
H:even tho they got it from him--the printed version is a pale imitation of
H:the real thing); he manages to make it sound in places like a duet played
H:on one instrument. Then there are the plucked strings and the clogging, of
H:course, as well as some subtle spizzicato (sp?) variations, i.e. the
H:bow-bouncing that's been mentioned in the list lately. Worth listening to
H:(And thanks for giving me the motivation to go back and re-listen to some
H:of Carignan's playing and to be reminded how good he really was)
N: Oh boy- bet this will cause confusion. I tried to keep things as simple
N:as possible (no triplets etc), but there is bound to be some confusion with the
N:fingerings. The numbers are the fingers you must use to produce the notes with
N:the desired effect. Try to do the tune a few times with what seems like "normal
N:fingerings", then try the funky ones. To save wear on fiddles, tune to GDGB (1
N:step down) or AbEbAbBb (1/2 step down). This is a tricky one to read, as the
N:notes aren't what they seem... but WELL worth the effort. The main technical
N:problems lie in the odd fingerings, nothing really tricky other than that. Look
N:at it as a translation problem. I'm curious to see if anyone writes it out
N:Note also- F part is played on the two bass strings simultaneously. If there is
N:only one note listed, don't sound the other string. Apologies to Mtex users- I'm
N:POSITIVE that this won't print out.
