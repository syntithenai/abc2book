H:This tune is for Petra Kaiser from Kerpen (near Cologne),
dancer, teacher and musician.
Those who have met her on dance workshops
will undoubtedly be able to figure out
the meaning of the title for themselves.
If you're thinking of ships and the sea
(as you should, considering that this tune is, after all, a hornpipe)
you're actually already quite close :-)
