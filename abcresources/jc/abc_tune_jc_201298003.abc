N:This version of the tune is based on recordings by Squip!, and published notation by Wolfgang Jehn: jehnmusik.de/akkordeonspiele/music/kruzifunger.php, and the playing of another dance band.
N:So, I believe that this version is "correct". It differs from all other ABC versions of this tune I've found in that bars 1 and 5 are 3 1/4 notes rather than 3 1/8 notes. In the other ABC versions, these bars are notated as 3/4, but only contain 3 1/8ths, another sign that this is a notation error, rather than intentional.
N:For dancers, this means 3 pivot steps instead of one waltz step.
