W: The rose by the door, I've seen it before, but never as lovely as now.
W: With you by my side, I'm filled with such pride, makes everything different somehow.
W: If my love were a boat, I'd set it afloat, and send it to gather up sun.
W: When it couldn't hold more, I'd bring it to shore, a present for my darling one.
W: Come dance through the night, your feet are so light.
W: Your hands make such music, I ne'er saw the like.
W: And when we are old, 'twill be better than gold, this day of the rose by the door.
