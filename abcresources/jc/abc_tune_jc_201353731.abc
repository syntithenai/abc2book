w: One sang high and an-oth-er sang low And the oth-er sang bon-ny, bon-ny Bis-cay, O!
W:There were three gipsies a-come to my door,
W:And downstairs ran this a-lady, O!
W:One sang high and another sang low
W:And the other sang bonny, bonny Biscay, O!
W:
W:Then she pull'd off her silk finish'd gown
W:And put on hose of leather, O!
W:The ragged, ragged rags about our door
W:She's gone with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
W:
W:It was late last night, when my lord came home,
W:Enquiring for his a-lady, O!
W:The servants said, on ev'ry hand:
W:She's gone with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
W:
W:O, saddle to me my milk-white steed,
W:Go and fetch me my pony, O!
W:That I may ride and seek my bride,
W:Who is gone with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
W:
W:O he rode high and he rode low,
W:He rode through woods and copses too,
W:Until he came to an open field,
W:And there he espied his a-lady, O!
W:
W:What makes you leave your house and land?
W:What makes you leave your money, O?
W:What makes you leave your new wedded lord,
W:To go with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O?
W:
W:What care I for my house and my land?
W:What care I for my money, O?
W:What care I for my new wedded lord?
W:I'm off with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
W:
W:Last night you slept on a goose-feather bed,
W:With the sheet turned down so bravely, O!
W:And tonight you'll sleep in a cold open field,
W:Along with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
W:
W:What care I for a goose-feather bed,
W:With the sheet turned down so bravely, O?
W:For tonight I'll sleep in a cold open field,
W:Along with the wraggle taggle gipsies, O!
