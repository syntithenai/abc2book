The Ghost that 'aunted Bunty
For notation click here

This is a sang that's just come out,
Ye'll want te hear it, there is ne doot,
So aa'll try te tell ye aal aboot
The ghost that 'aunted Bunty
Bunty lives not far frae here,
He's a terrible chap for drinkin beer;
An' from his yem he went way,
But manny's the time he rued the day.
As he was comin yem that neet,
Something white he chanced te meet;
He stood an' leuked, he said Aalreet-
But thou cannot frighten Bunty.
Chorsu-
Fol de rol de rol de ray
Fol de rol de rol de ray
Fol de rol de rol de ray,
The ghost that 'aunted Bunty.
Bunty sais, If aa'd a gun,
Aa wad knock tha doon or make tha run,
Aa wad let tha see tha'd not make fun,
Or try te frighten Bunty.
Come oot o' the way, an' let me past,
An' dinna make thisel se fast;
Thou think aa dinna knaa whe thou is,
But aa ken nicely whe it is.
The ghost then spread his airms baith oot,
Which made poor Bunty shake an' shoot,
Thou's a fairly ghost there is ne doot,
But keep away frae Bunty.
Bunth then began te say,
Aa wish aa'd gyen the tother way,
Or sat an' drank another day--
An'aa wadn't ha' been se frightent.
Aa've getten drunk noo many a time,
But never did commit a crime;
Aa love me neighbour as mesel;
the worst o' me, aa like me yell.
But O canny ghost, if thoo'll let me be,
Aa'll never mair gan on the spree,
Aa will aalways choose good company
Te gan alang wi' Bunty.
Bunty stooped te pick up a stane;
He grappled about, but findin nane,
He said O Ghost, let me alane,
An aa'll be Teetotal Bunty.
Aa'll try te mind me aan affaris,
At neets an' mornins say me prayers;
Aa'll make the bairns aal say theirs,
At neets, before they gan upstairs;
Aa'll try to be a diff'rent man;
Aa'll bide at yem beside wor Nan.
He turned about, an' off he ran,
But the ghost ran after Booty.
He ran till he was short o' breeth;
He said, There's nowt for me but deeth.
the ghost was there, an' scringed his teeth;
He still is wantin Bunty.
He took poor Bunt up in his airm,
Just like as if he'd been a bairn;
He clashed him doon upon a stane;
When he got up the ghost was gyen.
He sais, Thank God, yence mair aa's free;
He's had a nice bit fun wi' me
As wonder whe the ghost can be,
That has been after Bunty.
Strite off yem poor Bunty ran;
He knocked at the door an' shouted, Nan!
Be as sharp as ever thou can;
The ghost's been after Bunty!
She turned the lock an' eased the sneck;
He flung his arms around hor neck;
His hair stood strite up frae his heed.
He sais, As's nearly flaid te deed.
Lock the door, he'll be here just noo!
Get out, says Nan; it isn't true!
Sa that again, an' aa'll bring him to thoo
For he's been after Bunty!
