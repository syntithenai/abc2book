%% Ed Bonsell is a fine hammer
%% dulcimer player from Ft. Washington, PA. He has a nursery
%% in his back yard where he raises pretty trees and bushes
%% and woodchucks. He also has a real nice friend named
%% Priscilla Mather (whom he does NOT keep in the back yard) and
%% I happen to think she's so cool that I wrote her this tune. I
%% sure hope you like it, Priscilla - See if you can get Eddy to
%% play it for you on his dulcimer - much love to you guys -
