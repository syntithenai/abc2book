w:roved the coun-try round a-bout, A mer-ry jour-ney-man._
W:Young Jack he was a journeyman
W:That roved from town to town,
W:And when he'd done a job of work,
W:He lightly sat him down.
W:With his kit upon his shoulder, and
W:A grafting knife in hand,
W:He roved the country round about,
W:A merry journey-man.
W:
W:And when he came to Exeter,
W:The maidens lept with joy;
W:Said one and all, both short and tall,
W:Here comes a gallant boy.
W:The lady dropt her needle, and
W:The maid her frying-pan,
W:Each plainly told her mother, that
W:She loved the journey-man.
W:
W:He had not been in Exeter,
W:The days were barely three,
W:Before the Mayor, his sweet daughter.
W:She loved him desparately;
W:She bid him to her mother's house,
W:She took him by the hand.,
W:Said she, "my dearest mother, see
W:I love the journey-man!"
W:
W:Now out on thee, thou silly maid!
W:Such folly speak no more:
W:How can'st thou love a roving man,
W:Thoust ne'er seen before?
W:"O mother sweet, I do entreat,
W:I love him all I can;
W:Around the country glad I'll rove
W:With this young journey-man.
W:
W:"He need no more to trudge afoot,
W:He'll travel with coach and pair;
W:My wealth with me - or poverty
W:With him content I'll share."
W:Now fill the horn with barleycorn,
W:And flowing fill the can:
W:Here let us toast the Mayor's daugter
W:And the roving journey-man.
