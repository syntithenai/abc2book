W:1. One evening as the sun went down, and the jungle fire was burning,
W:Down the track came a hobo hiking, and he said, "Boys, I'm not turning.
W:I'm heading for a land that's far away beside the crystal fountain.
W:So, come with me. We値l go and see the Big Rock Candy Mountains."
W:
W:2. In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, there's a land that's fair and bright,
W:Where the handouts grow on bushes, and you sleep out ev'ry night.
W:Where the boxcars all are empty, and the sun shines ev'ry day.
W:Oh, the birds and the bees and the cigarette trees,
W:The lemonade springs where the bluebird sings,
W:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
W:
W:3. In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, all the cops have wooden legs,
W:And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth, and the hens lay soft boiled eggs.
W:The farmer's tree are full or fruit, and the barns are full of hay.
W:Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow,
W:Where the rain don't fall, and the wind don't blow,
W:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
W:
W:4. In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, you never change your socks,
W:And little streams of alcohol come trickling down the rocks.
W:The brakemen have to tip their hats, and the railroad bulls are blind.
W:There's a lake of stew, and whiskey, too,
W:And you can paddle all around it in a big canoe,
W:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
W:
W:5. In the Big Rock Candy Mountains, the jails are made of tin,
W:And you can walk right out again as soon as you are in.
W:There ain't no short-handled shovels, no axes, saws or picks.
W:Oh, I'm bound to stay where you sleep all day,
W:Where they hung the jerk that invented work,
W:In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
W:
W:(whistle)
W:
W:I値l see you all this coming fall in the Big Rock Candy Mountains.
