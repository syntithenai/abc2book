%% "The Four Hand Reel" as far as the writer is aware was first brought
%% to Chicago in 1886 by Barney Delaney, an excellent Irish piper. So
%% versatile was he, like most great Irish musicians, in the manipulation
%% of his instrument, that he varied his tunes according to fancy
%% without detriment to tone or rhythm, but rather to the advantage of
%% the general effect. Although not included in any collection of Irish
%% music published beyond the Atlantic, the strain must have been quite
%% popular in the Eastern States, for we find the tune in a Boston
%% publication no less than four times, and named respectively:
%% "Corporal Casey's Favorite", "Lady Gardner's Reel", "Parnell's Reel",
%% and "Yellow-Haired Laddie"; all consisting of but two parts each.

%% The setting here presented was memorized from Delaney's playing,
%% but no bare scoring of measured bars could do justice to his
%% inimitable execution.

%% Since the foregoing was written I find that "The Five Mile Chase"
%% in R.M. Levey's Second Collection of the Dance Music of Ireland,
%% London, 1873; consisting of but two parts, is also a variant of
%% "The Four Hand Reel".
