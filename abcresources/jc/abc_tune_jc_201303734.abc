w:cern-ing Frank-lin and his gal-lant crew
W:It was homeward bound one night on the deep
W:Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
W:I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
W:Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew.
W:
W:With a hundred seamen he sailed away
W:To the frozen ocean in the month of May
W:To seek that passage around the pole
W:Where we poor sailors do sometimes go.
W:
W:Through cruel hardship his men did go
W:His ship on mountains of ice was drove
W:Where the Eskimo in his skin canoe
W:Was the only one who ever came through.
W:
W:In Baffin Bay where the Whale fish blow
W:The fate of Franklin no man may know
W:The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
W:Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell.
W:
W:And now my burden it gives me pain
W:For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
W:Ten thousand pounds would I freely give
W:To know on earth that my Franklin do live.
