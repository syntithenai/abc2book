Q:450
N:I was walking up Seamab Hill behind Pool of Muckhart one
N:New Year's day. It was freezing cold, and as I sat down on
N:the summit I spotted a spider marching puposefully across
N:the frozen snow- walking off a hangover like me perhaps?
N:During the time we were arranging this tune for the Spyka
N:album there was a blackbird in the garden where we were
N:playing that kept singing the same little riff over and over.
N:Inevitably this riff found its way into the arrangement, with
N:the blackbird itself singing on the recording.
