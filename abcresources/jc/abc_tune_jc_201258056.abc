W: Now the deputy says 'Thee plaice is holed, ye'll hev te gan straight on',
W: Aa says te him 'What's the matter wi' mi aan? He says 'She canna gan on.'
W: Now Aa filled fifteen oot of a judd, titty fa-la, titty fa-lay,
W: Aw by God, she was good, titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
W: Aa went oot te get a shaft, when the timmer it gave a crack,
W: Aya and a stone fell on mi back, titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
w: Chorus
w: La la la-la-la-laa, Ower the walls oot.

w: A later verse:
w: Mi name it's Jackie Robinson, that name Aa div advance,
W: Aa drive a little Gallowa and the call her Little Chance.
W: Chancey has twee greasy feet, likewise a kickely back
W: And gannin alang the gannin boards she makes the chum'uns knack.
W: Whey Aa wes comin' aroond the turn, titty fala titty falay
W: Chancey wadnt hang on, titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
W: The tubs they gave a click, Aa jumped off at the switch,
W: Y'bugger Aa smashed the deputy's kist, titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
w: Chorus
w: The last verse as sung by the Elliots
w: There was me and mi wife and mi mother-in-law, we went to the silvery sea.
W: Mi mother-in-law got into a boat, a sailor she wad be.
W: She hadn't gone passin' twenty yards when all of a sudden there's a shoot.
W: Aa looks aroond and there's mi mother-in-law a-splashin aboot.
W: Whey, she shoots "Help Aa cannot swim!" titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
W: Aa says "Noos the time te larn". titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
W: Mi wife she says "Ye hoond, ye're not ganna watch her droond?"
W: Aa says "Naa, Aa'll shut mi eyes", titty fa-la, titty fa-lay
w: Chorus
