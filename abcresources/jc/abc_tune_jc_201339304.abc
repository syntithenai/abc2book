W:Songs of Shepherds in rustical roundelays,
W:Formed in fancy and whistled on reeds,
W:Sung to solace young nymphs upon holy days,
W:Are too unworthy for wonderful deeds;
W:Sottish Silenus to Phoebus the genius,
W:Was sent by dame Venus a song to prepare;
W:In phrase nicely coin'd
W:And verse quite refin'd;
W:How the states divine hunted the hare.
W:
W:Stars quite tir'd with pastimes Olympical,
W:Stars and planets that beautiful shone,
W:Could no longer endure men only shall
W:Swim in pleasures and they but look on;
W:Round about horned Lueina they swarmed,
W:And her informed how minded they were,
W:And each god and goddess,
W:To take human bodies,
W:As lords and ladies to follow the hare.
W:
W:Light God Cupid was mounted on Pegasus
W:Drawn from the Muses by kisses and prayers;
W:Stern Alcides upon cloudy Caucasus,
W:Mounted a centaur that proudly him bears;
W:Postillion of the sky,
W:Light-heel'd Mercury,
W:Made his courser fly fleet as the air;
W:While tuneful Apollo
W:The chase did follow,
W:And whoop and hollow, boys, after the hare.
W:
W:Three brown bowls to the Olympical rector,
W:The Troy-born boy presents on his knee;
W:Jove to Phoebus carouses in nectar,
W:And Phoebus to Hermes, and Hermes to me;
W:Wherewith infused,
W:I piped and I mused,
W:In language unused, their sports to declare;
W:Till the house of Jove,
W:Like the Spheres did move;
W:Health to those who love hunting the hare.
