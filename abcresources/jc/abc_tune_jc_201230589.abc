%% Debbie Ash lives in
%% Peterborough, where I live. She is a farrier, shoeing horses
%% all over (mostly their feet); she is involved in Search-and-Rescue
%% with her sweet doggies (who wash my neck) and
%% she likes to attend our contra dances as an observer.
%% All the best to you, Debbie - see you at Aesop's for coffee
%% in the morning! love, MAC
