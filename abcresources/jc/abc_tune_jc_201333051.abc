W:'Twas one midsummer morning,
W:As I walked o'er the grass,
W:I had no thought of 'listing
W:Till a soldier did me pass.
W:He kindly then invite of me
W:To drink a flowing bowl;
W:He advanced, he advanced,
W:He advanced, he advanced,
W:He advanced me that morning
W:Five guineas in bright gold.

W:O may he never prosper,
W:O may he never thrive,
W:In anything he ventures
W:So long as he's alive.
W:The very grass he treads on
W:The ground refuse to grow,
W:For that he alone, for that he alone,
W:For that he alone, for that he alone,
W:For that he alone has caus-ed
W:My exile, grief and woe.
W:
W:O now that I'm enlisted
W:And parted from my love,
W:I'll write her name, and carve it,
W:Throughout the greenwood grove,
W:Where the hunter long doth holloo,
W:The hounds so sweetly cry,
W:To remind me, to remind me,
W:To remind me, to remind me,
W:To remind me of my true love
W:Until the day I die
