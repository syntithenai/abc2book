w:To_ seek for serv-ice as you shall know
W:The grazier's daughter living near,
W:A fair young damsel as you shall hear,
W:Then up to London she did go,
W:To seek for service as you shall know.
W:
W:Her master having but one son,
W:Oh! she being fair, his heart she won,
W:Oh! Betsy being so very fair,
W:She drawed his heart into a snare.
W:
W:One Sunday evening he stole her thyme,
W:Unto young Betsy he told his mind,
W:"By all the swearing powers above,
W:'Tis you, fair Betsy, 'tis you I love."
W:
W:His mother then being standing nigh,
W:Hearing these words that her son did say,
W:Next morning by the break of day,
W:Unto fair Betsy she took her way.
W:
W:Saying, "Rise up, rise up, my fair Betsy,
W:And dress yourself most gallantly,
W:For in the country you must go,
W:Along with me for one day or two."
W:
W:As they were a-crossing over the plain,
W:They saw some ships sailing over the main,
W:No wit, no wit could this poor woman have,
W:But to sell poor Betsy to be a slave.
W:
W:In a few days after the mother returned,
W:"Oh! welcome, mother," replied the son,
W:"Come, tell me, tell me true, I pray,
W:Where is young Betsy? Behind you say?"
W:
W:"Oh! son, oh! son, I plainly see,
W:What love you bear to poor Betsy;
W:Your sobbing and sighing are all in vain,
W:For Betsy's a-sailing across the main."
W:
W:In a few days after her son lie sick,
W:No sort of music his heart could take,
W:But he often did sigh and often cry,
W:"Oh! Betsy, Betsy, I shall die."
W:
W:In a few days after her son lie dead,
W:Mother wrung her hands and she tore her head,
W:Saying, "If I could fetch but my son again,
W:I'd send for Betsy far over the main."
