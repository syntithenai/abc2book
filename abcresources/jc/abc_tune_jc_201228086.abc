%% A couple of summers ago Lee Breslaw and
%% Sarah Nelson had a music party at their home over in Londonderry.
%% We were playing tunes out in their back yard beside a great big pile
%% of brush, when suddenly, the fipple (Q.V.!) in Lorna McKinnon's
%% recorder loosened up and went flying out into the brush! Oh dear!
%% Well, we started pulling the brush apart, and suddenly, Lorna
%% _found her fipple! Oh joy! Amazing!!
