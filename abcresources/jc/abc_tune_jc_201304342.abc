O:Sharp MSS., 763/826.  Also in Sharp and Marson, 3rd series,
O:1906, pp. 26-27.  Sung by William Huxtable, Rowbarton, Taunton,
O:January 15, 1906.
H:The variants are from the singing of Bessie Huxtable, at Minehead,
January l2, 1906. She sang the first refrain line as "O yes, she said,
Sweet William and time."
This form of the tune is sung by Clive Carey, on a phonograpb
record (English Columbia, rec. WA 10685 [DB 335]).
Pope's text appears to be assigned in Sharp's MS. to Bessie
Huxtable's and William Huxtable's tune, above. But Pope's name may
inadvertently have been written for W. Huxtable's, since Pope
belonged to Alcombe, Dunster. Sharp usually tidied up the texts he printed.
