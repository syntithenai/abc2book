%% Back in the early
%% 70's, Dick and Marlene Levine arranged for the Canterbury
%% Orchestra to go down to the Middletown, NJ, Folk Festival.
%% We had a great time, and it was there that I met their
%% young son, David, who was just getting started with the
%% fiddle. He can fiddle up a storm now, and this is his
%% tune. Hope you have fun with it, David!
