%%*In the performance of this figure it has long been a practice
%% with persons unacquainted with the true system of Country
%% Dancing to make it a long instead of (what it really
%% is) a short figure, and by galloping down a dozen couple
%% instead of two (the proper extent of this figure) take up
%% in its performance a whole strain of Music in long
%% measure instead of half a strain, if this system is practised
%% the Dancer will have to every tune where this figure occurs
%% a figure too much for the Music as may be seen in this
%% figure, the first 4 bars of the Music is sufficient for
%% Lead down the middle & up again & the remaining 4 bars
%% of the strain are employed for the performance of Allemande.
%%   For a further Elucidation of this subject with an
%% explanation of the different Measures and Times of the
%% Music, see WILSON'S Companion to the Ball room.
