%% The summer of 2009 sent me
%% some super students at the Maine Fiddle Camp piano class,
%% and one of them was Fiona Crey Hall, from Camden. It
%% was so much fun working with you, Fio, and you did so
%% well, that I thought you earned a tune. So here it is,
%% and I hope you like it. Much love to you, from Bob--
