%% Jane Orzechowski lives up in
%% Newport, NH with Peter O. and five neat kids - She played fiddle
%% with "Greengate" and other for several years, and is most recently
%% a member of "Old New England", along with Deanna Stiles on flute
%% and yours truly on piano. We are having a wonderful time together,
%% and I'm glad she has her own march (note please: John Phillips Souze
%% I'm _NOT_!)
