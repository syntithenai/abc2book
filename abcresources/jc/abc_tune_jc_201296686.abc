W:The money in me hand, it looked so neat and jolly,
W:I took it right straight home, for to give to me Molly.
W:She swore that the loved me and she never would deceive me,
W:But the devil's in the women and they always lie so easy.
W:     Chorus
W:I went to me chambers to prepare myself for sumber,
W:To dream of gold and girls, and sure it is no wonder,
W:But Molly took me pistols and she filled them up with water,
W:And sent for Colonel Pepper to make ready for a slaughter

W:I woke next morning early, between six and seven,
W:With guards around me bed in both numbers odd and even.
W:I flew to me pistols, but alas, I was mistaken,
W:I couldn't shoot the water and prisoner I was taken.

W:For robbing Colonel Pepper up on Kilgary Mountain.
W:But they didn't take me fists, so I knocked the jailer down,
W:And bit myself adieu to the jail in Sligo town.
W:     Chorus
W:Now some gets their delight in the boxing and the bowling,
W:And some gets their delight in the hurling and the rolling.
W:But I get my delight from the juice of the barley,
W:And courting pretty girls in the morning oh so early.
W:     Chorus
