N:Ed wanted one of his tunes to commemorate
N:this favorite poem of his. He didn't know much Yeats, but what he knew
N:he appreciated-particularly the last verse of "the Swans"
N:But now they drift on the still water,
N:Mysterious, beautiful;
N:Among what rushes will they build,
N:By what lake's edge or pool,
N:Delight men's eyes when I awake someday,
N:To find they have flown away.
