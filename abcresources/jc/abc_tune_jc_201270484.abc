W:   Put him in a long-boat 'til he's sober, ...
W:   Put him in the scuppers until he's sober, ...
W:   Put him in the bilge and make him drink it, ...

W:   Heave him by the leg in a runnin' bowline, ...
W:   Lock him in the guard room 'til he gets sober, ...
W:   Put him in a cabin with the captain's daughter, ...
W:   You ain't seen the captain's daughter, ...
