W:There was an old woman to market did go,
W:To purchase herself a pig.
W:When taking the little porker home
W:He led her an awful rig.
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:The pig he won't jump over the stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:The old woman saw a dog passing by
W:When she'd waited a little while.
W:"Good doggie," said she, "will you bite the pig
W:And make him jump over the stile?"
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:"Dog won't bite pig;
W:Pig won't jump stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:The old woman saw a stick lying by
W:When she'd waited a little while.
W:"Good stick," said she, "will you beat the dog,
W:For the dog to bite the pig to jump the stile?"
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:"Stick won't beat dog;
W:Dog won't bite pig;
W:Pig won't jump over the stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:The old woman saw a blazing fire
W:When she'd waited a little while.
W:"Good fire," said she, "will you please burn the stick,
W:The stick to beat the dog, the dog to bite the pig,
W:the pig to jump the stile?"
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:"Fire won't burn stick;
W:Stick won't beat dog;
W:Dog won't bite pig;
W:Pig won't jump over the stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:The old woman saw a pool of water
W:When she'd waited a little while.
W:"Good water," said she, "will you squinch the fire,
W:The fire to burn the stick;
W:The stick to beat the dog;
W:The dog to bite the pig,
W:The pig to jump the stile?"
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:"Water won't squich fire;
W:Fire won't burn stick;
W:Stick won't beat dog;
W:Dog won't bite pig;
W:Pig won't jump over the stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:The old woman saw an ox passing by
W:And he came near the stile.
W:"Good ox," said she, "will you drink the water,
W:The water to squinch the fire;
W:The fire to burn the stick;
W:The stick to beat the dog;
W:The dog to bite the pig,
W:The pig to jump the stile?"
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry -
W:She was in a terrible plight -
W:"Ox won't drink water;
W:Water won't squich fire;
W:Fire won't burn stick;
W:Stick won't beat dog;
W:Dog won't bite pig;
W:Pig won't jump over the stile;
W:I shall never get home tonight."
W:
W:[So the old woman saw a butcher passing by
W:As he came near the stile.]
W:The butcher began to kill the ox, the ox to drink the water;
W:The water began to squinch the fire, the fire to burn the stick;
W:The stick began to beat the dog,
W:(Spoken) Dog to bite the pig, the pig to jump the stile.
W:"Oh my," was the old woman's cry,
W:"I'm not in such a terrible plight."
W:The little pig he jumped over the stile
W:And the old woman got home that night.
