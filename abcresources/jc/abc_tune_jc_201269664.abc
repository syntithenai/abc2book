w:ea-sy till my dar-ling were in my sight.
W:You rambling boys of pleasure, give ear to those few lines I write,
W:Although I'm a rover, and in roving I take great delight.
W:I set my mind on a handsome girl who ofttimes did me slight,
W:But my mind was never easy till my darling were in my sight.
W:
W:It was down by Sally's garden one evening late I took my way.
W:'Twas there I spied this pretty little girl, and those words to me sure she did say;
W:She advised me to take love easy, as the leaves grew on the tree,
W:But I was young and foolish, with my darling could not agree.
W:
W:The very next time I met my love, sure I thought her heart was mine,
W:But as the weather changes, my true love she changed her mind.
W:Cursed gold is the root of evil, oh it shines with a glittering hue,
W:Causes many the lad and lass to part, let their hearts be ever so true.
W:
W:Sure I wish I was in Dublin town, and my true love along with me,
W:With money to support us and keep us in good company,
W:With lots of liquor plentiful, flowing bowls on every side.
W:Let fortune never daunt you, my love, we're both young and the world is wide.
W:
W:But there's one thing more that grieves me sore is to be called a runaway,
W:And to leave the spot I was born in, oh Cupid cannot set me free,
W:And to leave the darling girl I love, oh, alas, what will I do?
W:Will I become a rover, sleep with the girl I never knew?
