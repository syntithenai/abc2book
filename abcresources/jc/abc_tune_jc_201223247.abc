%% Jason Little lives
%% over in Marlow, N.H., the "Icebox of the Monadnock
%% Region." Jason's a great musician. He and Harvey Tolman
%% made a super tape of Cape Breton tunes. This tune is supposed
%% to be that style, also. Jason, I began this tune in June 84 according
%% to my notes. I guess it's about time I finally finished it!
%% Hope you like it!
