w:beau-ty and *plea-sure were known.
W:One evening for pleasure I rambled
W:To view the fair fields all alone
W:It was down by the banks of Loch Erin
W:Where beauty and pleasure were known.
W:
W:I spied a fair maid at her labour,
W:Which caused me to stay for awhile;
W:I thought her the goddess of beauty,
W:The blooming bright star of Belle Isle.
W:
W:I humbled myself to her beauty;
W:'Fair maiden, where do you belong?
W:Are you from the heavens descended,
W:Abiding in Cupid's fair throng?.
W:
W:'Young man I will tell you a secret,
W:It's true I'm a maid that is poor,
W:And to part with my vows and my promises,
W:'Tis more than my poor heart can endure.
W:
W:Therefore I'll remain at my service,
W:And go through all hardships and toil,
W:And wait for the lad that do love me,
W:Alone on the banks of Belle Isle.'
W:
W:'Young maiden I wish not to banter,
W:It's true I came here in disguise;
W:I came to fulfil my last promise,
W:And hoped to give you a surprise.
W:
W:I own you're the maid I love dearly,
W:You've been in my heart all the while;
W:For there's no other damsel in this wide world
W:Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle.'
