%% What a wonderful place! I hope that, some day,
%% you, too, can go there. Sarah Bauhan[?] took me there on the best vacation
%% I ever had. We stayed with the Iain Bains at Acheronic, and were (and still
%% are) most grateful for their hospitality; we enjoyed beautiful scenery and great boat
%% rides; ate haggis (yummy) and roast beef and broiled salmon (more
%% yummy!); we played music with good friends at pubs, and I can
%% tell you right now that, for as long as I live, part of me will be in the Isle of
%% Mull, and part of Mull will always be with me.
