%% Whenever I go down to the
%% Augusta Heritage Arts Workshops, I always have the good fortune to
%% encounter caller-fiddler Bill Wellington, and so far he's never failed to fulfil
%% my heart's desire by getting me a good seat on the keyboard side of a piano,
%% and we go on from there. He and Betsy Bartholomew have a fine relationship,
%% and she was Ms concert coordinator last summer (and the one before that??
%% I forget - help me, Vicky) and she's a real neat lady, and so here's a tune for you
%% both, with fondest best wishes always and many thanks for happy times.
