W:A Cheshire man sailed into Spain,
W:To trade for merchandise;
W:When he arrived from the main,
W:A Spaniard him espies.
W:
W:Who said "You English rogue, look here!
W:What fruit and spices fine
W:Our land produces twice a year!
W:Thou hast not such in thine."
W:
W:The Cheshire man ran to his hoard,
W:And fetched a Cheshire cheese;
W:And said, "Look here, you dog! behold!
W:We have such fruits as these.
W:
W:"Your fruits are ripe but twice a year,
W:As you yourself do say;
W:But such as I present you here,
W:Our land brings twice a day."
W:
W:The Sapniard in a passion flew,
W:And his rapier took in hand;
W:The Cheshire man kick'd up his heels,
W:Saying "Thou'rt at my command."
W:
W:So never let the Sapniard boast
W:While Cheshire men abound;
W:Lest they should teach him to his cost
W:To dance a Cheshire round.
