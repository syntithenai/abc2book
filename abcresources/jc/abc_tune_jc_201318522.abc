W:(Chorus)
W:For 'tis O, good ale, thou art my darling
W:And my joy both night and morning.

W:The brewer brew'd thee in his pan,
W:The tapster draws thee in his can;
W:Now I with thee will play my part
W:And lodge thee next unto my heart
W:For tis, etc
W:
W:Thou oft hast made my friends my foes
W:And often made me pawn my clothes;
W:But since thou art so nigh my nose
W:Come up, my friend, and down he goes.
W:For 'tis, etc
