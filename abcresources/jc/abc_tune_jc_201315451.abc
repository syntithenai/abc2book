w:My_ John-ny was a shoe-mak-er.
W:My Johnny was a shoemaker, and dearly he loved me;
W:My Johnny was a shoemaker, but now he's gone to sea;
W:With nasty pitch to soil his hands,
W:And sail upon the stormy sea
W:My Johnny was a shoemaker.

W:His jacket was a deep sky blue, and curly was his hair,
W:His jacket was a deep sky blue, it was I do declare;
W:To reef the topsail now he's gone
W:And sail upon the stormy sea
W:My Johnny was a shoemaker.

W:And he will be a captain by and bye, with a brave and gallant crew
W:And he will be a captain by and bye, with a sword and spyglass too,
W:And when he is a captain bold,
W:He'll come back and marry me,
W:My Johnny was a shoemaker.
