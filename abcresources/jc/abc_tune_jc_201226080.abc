%% When you go (you _WILL_ go, you
%% know) to Seattle, WA, you will discover that one of the 237 Scenic Seattle Wonders is
%% the "S" Curves. These are 3 lucious lovelies who sing like nightingales -
%% 3-part harmonies of the 50's and 60's; and of course, they have Pat Spaeth doing
%% miracles on the piano to go with, and they are AWESOME! Talk about your Audio-Video
%% extravaganza! You'll see! And when you do, tell them I sent you, and give
%% them my love - Wendy Whittemore, Juanita Rmsay, Anita Anderson - Thanks for your
%% beautiful music - I can't wait to hear you again!
