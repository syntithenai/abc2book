W: I'll tell you of a raftsman right from the pinery,
W: And how he loved a lady, she was of a high degree,
W: Her fortune was so great it scarcely could be told,
W: And still she loved the raftsman because he was so bold.
W:
W: One day when they had been to church and were just returning home,
W: They met her old father and several armed men,
W: "Oh daughter, oh daughter, oh daughter I pray,
W: Is this your good behavior, or is't your wedding day?"
W:
W: "I fear," cried the lady, "we both shall be slain,"
W: "Fear nothing at all," said the raftsman again,
W: "Now, since you've been so foolish as to be a raftsman's wife,
W: Down in this lonely valley I will quickly end your life."
W:
W: "Hold," cried the raftsma, "I do not like such prattle,
W: Although I am the bridegroom, I'm all prepared for battle,"
W: He drew his sword and pistol and caused them for to roar,
W: The lady held the horses while the raftsman battled sore.
W:
W: The first man came to him, he ran him through the main,
W: The next one stepped up to him, he served him the same,
W: "Let's run," cried the rest of them, "we all shall be slain,
W: To fight this gallant raftsman is altogether vain."
W:
W: "Stay," cried the old man, "you make my blood run cold,
W: You shall have my daughter and five thousand pounds in gold,"
W: "Oh no," cried the lady, "the fortune is too small,
W: Fight on, my bold raftsman, and you shall have it all."
W:
W: "Oh raftsman, oh raftsman, if you will spare my life,
W: You shall have my daughter for your beloved wife,"
W: He took them home unto his house, he made him his heir,
W: It wasn't out of love but it was from dread and fear.
W:
W: Come all you rich maidens with money in great store,
W: Never shun a raftsman, although he may be poor,
W: For they're jolly good fellows-happy, fresh, and free,
W: And how gallantly they fight for their rights and liberty.
