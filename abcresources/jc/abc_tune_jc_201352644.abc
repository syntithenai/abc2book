W:Young man come from hunting, faint and weary
W:"What doth ail my lord, my dearie?"
W:"Oh mother dear, let my bed be made
W:For I feel the gripe of the woody nightshade."
W:Lie low, sweet Randal

W:And they that sup right merry
W:'Tis better, I entreat, to have toads for your meat
W:Than to eat of the wild, wild berry.
W:
W:This young man, he died eftsoon
W:By the light of a hunter's moon
W:'Twas not by bolt, nor yet by blade,
W:But the deathly gripe of the deadly nightshade.
W:Lie low, sweet Randal
W:Now all you young men that do eat full well
W:And they that sup right merry
W:'Tis better, I entreat, to have toads for your meat
W:Than to eat of the wild, wild berry.
W:
W:This lord's false love, they hanged her high
W:For her deeds were the cause of her love to die
W:And within her locks, they entwined a braid
W:Of the leaves and berry of the deadly nightshade.
W:Lie low, sweet Randal
W:Now all you young men that do eat full well
W:And they that sup right merry
W:'Tis better, I entreat, to have toads for your meat
W:Than to eat of the wild, wild berry.
