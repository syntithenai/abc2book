w:Our gal-lant sea-men a lord did wear.
W:I'm a gay young sailor stout and strong.    
W:a bow like vessel I do belong,
W: All carved in anchor so fine and rare,
W:Our gallant seamen a lord did wear.
W:
W:Our captain's name was William Gower
W:His crew amounted to just four score.
W:Our seamen's brave as ever crossed the sea
W:Bound for New York in Amerikee.
W:
W:Our captain in his cabin lay
W:And a dreadful voice to him did say:
W:Prepare yourself and ship's company
W:For tomorrow night in the deep might lay.
W:
W:O boatsman, boatsman, don;t ley none know
W:What we poor sailors do undergo,
W:But keep my secrets in your breast
W:And pray to God to give you rest.
W:
W:O boatsman, boatsman, it grieves my heart
W:To think I've acted a villain's part
W:By keeping that which was not my due,
W:Starved my passengers and ship's crew.
W:
W:I killed my wife and children three,
W:'Twas all for the sake of jealousy.
W:
W:And a gay young sailor he beared the blame
W:He was hanged and quartered for the same.
W:It is his ghost, I am afraid,
W:This very night my heart betrayed.
W:
W:The sea runs over us both fore and aft
W:Till a very few men was left on the deck.
W:At length our boatsman did declare
W:Our captain was a strong murderer.
W:
W:The sea emerged all the ship's crew
W:And overboard the captain threw.
W:The wind did cease and calm the sea
W:And we sailed safe to Amerikee.
