%% Last night was such
%% fun. Deanna Stiles (flute), Janie Orzechowski (fiddle),
%% and I (piano) played for a dance in Francestown (20
%% minuts from my house), and we had such a good time.
%% You should have heard those two sail into Cincinatti,
%% Durang's, and Bricklayer's - They were just wonderful!
