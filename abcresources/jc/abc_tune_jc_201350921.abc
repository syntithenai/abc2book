Q:450
N:The title of this reel comes from an incident on a cross-
N:channel ferry. As I stood in a long queue to exchange
N:currency a small boy ran excitedly up to the man in front of
N:me shouting 'Dad, dad, we just missed the rock'. Looks of
N:alarm and panic flickered across the faces of those around me
N:-'A rock, in the channel? It's a good thing we didn't hit it or
N:we could all be sinking right now!' However, it transpired that
N:The Rock is a film starring Nicholas Cage so there was no
N:real danger after all.
