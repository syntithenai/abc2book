%% Weekend finds a small group of us musical types
%% gathered for our annual get-together at Camp Isabella
%% Freedman, in Falls Village, CT. Called The Indian Neck
%% Folk Festival (that's where it used to be held), it is a happy
%% time. Robert Murray's cooking contributes to that
%% happiness, so much so that I thought he deserved a tune of
%% his own for all his hard work. I Hope you agree! Thanks, Robert!
