%% Pete Jung (pro. yung) hails from
%% Kingston, N.Y., and does great stuff on both guitar and bass. You can hear him
%% on Bo Bradham's new tape "Moving Clouds", and he wrote a waltz called "Far
%% Away" which is truly "state of the art", it's so beautiful. This tune attempts
%% to tell you how much I appreciate both, your tune and you, Pete -
