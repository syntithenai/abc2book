W: For the Charlie Chester song, the tune is played 1A 1B, as a 48 polka 1A 2B
W:Sand bags, wind bags, camels with a hump,
W:Fat girls, thin girls, some a little plump,
W:Slave girls sold here, fifty bob a lump,
W:In the old bazaar in Cairo.
W:Brandy, shandy, beer without a froth,
W:Braces, laces, a candle for the moth.
W:Bet you'd look a smasher in an old loin cloth,
W:In the old bazaar in Cairo.
W:You can buy most anything,
W:Thin bulls, fat cows, a little bit of string,
W:You can purchase anything you wish,
W:A clock, a dish and something for your Auntie Nellie,
W:Harem, scarem, what d'ya think of that,
W:Bare knees, striptease, dancing on the mat,
W:Umpa! Umpa! That's enough of that,

W:In the old bazaar in Cairo.
W:Rice pud, very good, what's it all about,
W:Made it in a kettle and they couldn't get it out,
W:Everybody took a turn to suck it through the spout,
W:In the old bazaar in Cairo.
W:Mamadan, Ramadan, everything in style,
W:Genuine, beduine carpet with a pile,
W:Funny little odds and ends floating down the Nile,
W:From the old bazaar in Cairo.
W:You can buy most anything,
W:Sheeps eyes, sand pies, a watch without a spring,
W:You can buy a pomegranate too,
W:A water-bag, a little bit of hokey pokey,
W:Yashmaks, pontefracts, what a strange affair,
W:Dark girls, fair girls, some with ginger hair,
W:The rest of it is funny but they censor it out there,
W:In the old bazaar in Cairo.
