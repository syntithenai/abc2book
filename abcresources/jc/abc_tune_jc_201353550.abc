D:Sharon Shannon (first album) track 14
H:In the sleeve notes it says that she learnt the tune from two Swedish
H:musicians, "Jurgen and Lotta". Jo:rgen Astner is a very good banjo and
H:box player, and his wife Lotta plays the fiddle. They live on the
H:island of O:land in the Southeast of Sweden. I don't know where they
H:got this tune from, but I could ask them.
