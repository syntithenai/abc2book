w: 1.~Hark where the night is fall-ing.  Hark hear the pipes a call-ing Loud-ly and proud-ly call-ing down thru the glen.***
w: 2.~High in the mist-y moun-tains, Out by the pur-ple high-lands, Brave are the hearts that beat be-neath Scot-tish skies.***
w: 3.~Far-off in sun-lit pla-ces, Sad are the Scot-tish fa-ces, Yearn-ing to feel the kiss of sweet Scot-tish rain.***

w: There where the hills are sleep-ing, Now feel the blood a leap-ing, High as the spi-rits of the old high-land men.**
w: Wild are the winds to meet you.  Staunch are the friends that greet you.  Kind as the love that shines from fair maid-ens eyes.**
w: Where tro-pic skies are beam-ing, Love sets the heart a'-dream-ing, Long-ing and dream-ing for the home-land a-gain!**
