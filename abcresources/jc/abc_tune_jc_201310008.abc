W: Chorus:
W:    Heel y'ho boys, let her go, boys
W:    Bring her head round now all together
W:    Heel y'ho boys, let her go boys
W:    Sailing homeward to Mingulay!
W: What care we tho' white the Minch is
W: What care we for wind and weather?
W: Let her go boys, every inch is
W: Wearing homeward to Mingulay!
W:    Chorus
W: Wives are waiting on the bank, boys, .
W: Looking seaward from the heather.
W: Pull her 'round boys, and we'll anchor
W: 'Ere the sun sets at Mingulay!
W:    Chorus
