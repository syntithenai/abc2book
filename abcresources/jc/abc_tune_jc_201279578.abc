W:The day was gone, the moon shone bright,
W:The village clock struck eight,
W:Young Mary hasened with de-light
W:Unto the garden gate.
W:But what was there to make her sad?
W:The gate was there but not the lad;
W:Which made poor Mary say and sigh,
W:"Was ever poor girl so used as I?"
W:
W:She waited here, she waited there,
W:The village clock struck nine;
W:Which made poor Mary to sigh and swear
W:"You shan't, you shan't be mine;
W:You promised to meet me here at eight
W:You have deceived me and made me wait
W:But I'll let all such sweethearts see
W:They never shall make a fool of me."
W:
W:She traced the garden here and there,
W:The village clock struck ten,
W:When William caught her in his arms,
W:Oh ne'er to part again.
W:For he had been for the ring that day
W:Which took him from home such a long, long way,
W:Then how could Mary cruel prove
W:To banish the lad she so dearly did love?
W:
W:Up with the morning sun they rose
W:To church they went away,
W:And all the village joyful were,
W:Upon their wedding-day.
W:Now in a cot by a river side,
W:William and Mary both reside;
W:And she blesses the night that she did wait
W:For her absent swain at the garden gate.
