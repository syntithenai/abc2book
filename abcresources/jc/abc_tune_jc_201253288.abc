w:And if I was with m-y love, I'd live for ev-er._
W:A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better.
W:He fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter.
W:With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever,
W:And if I was with my love, I'd live forever.
W:
W:And where is my love gone, with his cheeks like roses,
W:And his good black billycock on, decked with primroses?
W:I'm afraid the scorching sun will shine and burn his beauty,
W:And if I was with my love, I'd do my duty.
W:
W:Strange news is come to town, strange news is carried,
W:Strange news flies up and down that my love is married.
W:I wish them both much joy, though they don't here me,
W:And may God reward him well for the slighting of me.
W:
W:'What did you promise when you sat beside me?
W:You said you would marry me, and not deny me.'
W:'If I said I'd marry you, it was only for to try you.
W:So bring your witness love, and I'll never deny you.'
W:
W:'Oh, witness have I none save God Almighty.
W:And He'll reward you well for slighting of me.'
W:Her lips grew pale and white, it made her poor heart tremble
W:To think she loved one, and he proved deceitful.
