W:Our jolly wassail, our jolly wassail,
W:Love and joy come to you,

W:We are not daily beggars, that beg from door to door;
W:We are the neighbours' children, whom you have seen before.
W:
W:I have a little purse, it is made of leather skin;
W:I want a little sixpence, to line it well within.
W:
W:Bring us out your table, and spread it with the cloth;
W:Bring us out the bread and cheese, and a bit of your Christmas loaf.
W:
W:God bless the master of this house, and the mistress too;
W:Also the little children which round the table grew.
