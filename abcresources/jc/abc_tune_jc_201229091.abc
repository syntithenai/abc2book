Dis een wis made up be an auld fiddler named Jack Goudie frae
da Ness.  Some said dat he'd hed a dunt on his head when he
wis young dat gave him queer turns.  He wis a very good fiddler
an made up loks o' t\"uns.  Wan night in Lerook wi a dram in him
he got a queer turn an da poliss lockit him up ida auld prison.
He waited til dey wir sleepin an dan he brook doon da prison
door an made fir hame as fast as he could.  Da poliss wir awaur
it he wis gaen, bit tocht better to let be fir let be, so dey
didna geng efter him.  When Jack got hame he took his fiddle
an made up dis t\"un an caaed him, "Jack Broke da Prison Door".
If du listens to da first twartre notes du can hear hit sayin dat.
