W:I'll build myself a gallant ship,
W:A ship of noble fame;
W:And four and twenty mariners,
W:Shall box and man the same;
W:And I will stand with helm in hand,
W:To urge them oe'r the main.
W:
W:No scarf shall o'er my shoulders go,
W:I wil not comb my hair;
W:The pale moonlight, the candle bright
W:Shall neither tell I'm fair.
W:Beside the mast I stand so fast,
W:Unresting in despair.
W:
W:The rain may beat, and round my feet
W:The waters wash and foam,
W:O thou North wind lag not behind
W:But bear me far from home!
W:My hands I wring, and sobbing sing,
W:As over seas I roam.
W:
W:The moon so pale shall light my sail,
W:As o'er the sea I fly,
W:To where afar the Eastern star
W:Is twinkling in the sky.
W:I would I were with my love fair,
W:E'er ever my love die!
