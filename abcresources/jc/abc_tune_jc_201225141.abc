%% ssissy ffolliott (that's the way
%% she writes it) is a fine fiddler and dancer from South Hamilton,
%% and she's awfully nice to me when I'm down that way.
%% Once, when it was a real hot night, she brought me a
%% big glass of ice cold ginger ale during the break.
%% Boy, did that ever taste good! Thanks a lot, Ssissy!
