W:I went down to St. James infirm'ry.
W:I saw my baby there,
W:stretched out on a long white table,
W:so sweet, so cool and so fair.
W:
W:Though she treated me mean and low-down,
W:somehow I didn't care.
W:Oh, the Lord knows she was a good girl,
W:and I'll see her again up there.
W:
W:Let her go, let her go, god bless her
W:wherever she may be.
W:She can look this wide world over
W:but she'll never find a sweet man like me.
W:
W:When I die, bury me in straight lace shoes,
W:a boxback coat and a stetson hat.
W:Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
W:so the boys know I died standing flat.
