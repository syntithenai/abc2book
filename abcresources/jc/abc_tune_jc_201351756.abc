W:2.The dainty sprites that still remaine in fleeting aire
W:  Affect for pastime to untwine her tressed hair,
W:  And the birds think sweete Aurora, morning's Queene doth shine
W:  From her bright sphere when Laura shews her looks devine.

W:3.Diana's eyes are not adorn'd with greater power
W:  Than Laura's when she lists awhile for sport to loure,
W:  But when she her eyes encloseth, blindnesse doth appear
W:  The chiefest grace of beauty sweetly seated there.
W:
W:4.Love hath no fire but what he steales from her bright eyes,
W:  Time hath no power, but that which in her pleasure lies,
W:  For she with her devine beauties all the world subdues,
W:  And fills with heav'nly spirits my humble muse.
