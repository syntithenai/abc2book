%% You've already met my
%% good Monday-Night-in-Nelson-Caller-Dancer-friend (that's
%% a noun and it's all one word) Don Primrose in this book,
%% but what I didn't tell you before is that he's nuts about polkas!
%% He'd walk a mile (2 miles?) to dance a polka. Harvey Tolman's
%% been playing this one for Don lately, and it's fun watching him
%% go. Especially when he's dancing with daughter Shannon.
%% Now _there's_ a wonderful sight to see!!
