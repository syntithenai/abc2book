w:in the O-hi-o_ State
W:I often heard of Shakers while in my native land
W:That they were a deluded a blind bewitched band
W:Such awful news was spreading, too horrid to relate
W:How wicked they were acting in the Ohio State.
W:
W:At length I went amongst them to see how they went on
W:I quickly was convinced that those reports were wrong.
W:I found they were a people such as I'd never seen
W:So bright so pure so holy so much opposed to sin.
W:
W:I often heard of Zion but now I've found the place
W:The City that's adorned with truth and love and grace
W:My heart was struck with wonder to find such glory there
W:Where all was peace and glory without a single jar.
W:
W:I found I'd got to Zion where saints and angels dwelt
W:Such piercing streams of glory my heart had never felt
W:This is no place of darkness but one eternal day
W:Here doubts and fears are banish'd and satan cannot stay.
W:
W:I cried adieu to pleasure of every other kind
W:I'll give up all my Idols and leave the world behind.
W:I found the blessed people with whom I'll bear the cross
W:And count all earthly glory but vanity and dross.
W:
W:Here is the holy fire that burns all sin and shame
W:The guilty sons of babel cannot endure the flame
W:I'll shout eternal praises to Jacobs awful King
W:That I have found such glory as saves the soul from sin.
W:
W:O why was I so stupid to stay away so long
W:And labor in confusion with babel's mixed throng
W:But since I've found the city where God in glory reigns
W:I'll bid adieu to Sodom and all its dismal pains.
W:
W:Salvation here is flowing from sin and dross refign'd
W:I'm willing here to tarry and leave my lust behind
W:I feel my soul united to this despised flock
W:Let death and hell [oppose] us we are safe upon the rock.
W:
W:Though persecution rages we'll boldly shout and sing
W:We shall be safely guarded by Salem's conquering King,
W:Amidst all tribulation we feel our love increase
W:Altho' the world doth hate us in Zion we have peace.
W:
W:Sweet union here is rolling all thro' this happy place
W:Here flows the crystal fountain and God unveils his face
W:Fair lillies here are growing that never fade or die
W:No other ground produces such fruits of peace and joy.
W:
W:How blessed are the people who are admitted in
W:And dwell secure in Zion delivered from all sin
W:Their joys are still increasing their songs are always new
W:They love their great Creator and all their brethren too.
