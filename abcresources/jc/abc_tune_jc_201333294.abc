W:A sailor's life is a merry life:
W:They rob young girls of their heart's delight,
W:Leaving them behind to sigh and mourn:
W:They never know when they will return.

W:Here's four and twenty in a row;
W:My sweetheart cuts the brightest show.
W:He's proper, tall, genteel withal,
W:And if I don't have him I'll have none at all.

W:"O father, fetch me a little boat
W:That I might on the ocean float,
W:And every queen's ship that we pass by
W:I'll make enquire for my sailor boy."
W:
W:We had not sailed long upon the deep
W:Before a queen's ship we chanced to meet.
W:"You sailors all, come tell me true,
W:Does my sweet Willam sail among your crew?"
W:
W:"Oh no, fair lady, he is not here,
W:For he is drown-ed, we greatly fear.
W:On yon green island as we passed by
W:There we lost sight of your sailor boy."
W:
W:She wrung her hands and she tore her hair.
W:Much like a woman in great despair.
W:Her little boat 'gainst a rock did run:
W:"How can I live now my William is gone?"
