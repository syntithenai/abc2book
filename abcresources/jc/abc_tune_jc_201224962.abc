%% Do you know Monica
%% Strogen from the West Coast? I met her in Seattle at
%% Frank + Dina Blade's. She's a really good button box
%% player and we played a few tunes together. We
%% had a good time, and I told her if she kept it up
%% the way she was going, she was going to be a
%% great boxman someday (gimme a break, that's
%% supposed to be =funny=).
%% She's in Ireland now, and
%% having the time of her life.
