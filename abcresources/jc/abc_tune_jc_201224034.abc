%% A lot of nice people
%% are involved with dance music out on the West
%% Coast, and one of them is Armin Barnett of Seattle.
%% Armin is a real fine fiddler, and he also _makes_
% real fine fiddles. He's even been known to teach
%% FRank Blade how to make and repair fiddles; I guess
%% all these things are reason enough for this tune's being here!
