%% That night, a brand new contradance band had its
%% "World Premier" when "Old New England" played over in Francestown[?]. The fiddler
%% was Janie Orzechowski, Dearma[?] Stiles played flute and piccolo, and I
%% played piano. We had a real nice evening. There was a pretty good turn-out, and
%% the reason for that was that Ed Hall, from Greenfield NH, who did a great
%% job calling the dance, did everything he could to publicize it, including
%% having some really neat fliers printed. Thanks loads for all your hard
%% work, Ed - we really appreciate all you did to launch us in style!
