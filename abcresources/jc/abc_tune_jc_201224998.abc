%% Once upon a time there was a band who
%% called themselves the "Bobolinks". Deanna Stiles was the spark plug of this
%% group. Deanna loves to play these little tunes of mine, and she got this band
%% interested in them, hence its name (link with Bob). So that's what happened,
%% and Mark Dowdy was the mandolin player, and I see Mark occasionally
%% at a dance, and he's a real nice guy, and soooo - Now you have a new
%% tune to try out on your mandolin, Mark!
