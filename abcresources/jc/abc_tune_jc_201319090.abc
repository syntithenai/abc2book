W:If she will buy one inch of cloth,
W:To make a shirt to wear thereof.
W:
W:Tell her to sew it up without any seam,
W:And wash it in water that never was seen.
W:
W:Tell her to wring it out of a dry well,
W:Where never a drop of rainwater fell.
W:
W:And hang it out on a bush of thorn,
W:Which never bore bud since Adam was born.
W:
W:Oh say, do you know the way back again?
W:Remember me to a young man therein.
W:
W:If he will buy one acre of land;
W:Between the salt water and the sea sand.
W:
W:Tell him to plow it with one turtle's horn;
W:And plant it all over with one peppercorn.
W:
W:Tell him to reap it down with a goose quill;
W:And winnow it up inyo an egg shell.
W:
W:Tell him to reap it down into a trice;
W:And haul it home with a yoke of mice.
W:
W:Tell him to put it into a dry barn;
W:Which never's been boarded since Adam was born.
W:
W:Tell the man when he's done his work,
W:To come to me and he will have his shirt.
