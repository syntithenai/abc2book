%% Perhaps you've
%% heard the tune "Mairi's Wedding"- it's been around a long
%% time, but it gave birth to this tune, which is brand
%% new, because it's celebrating Linda Morley's marriage
%% to Ormand Szainer on 21 April 91. Congratulations and
%% very best wishes to you both!

N: Bob seems to have spelled it "Mauri's Wedding", but I can't find any reference to that anywhere.
