W:The time is come, I must be going,

W:All over the mountains I've rode with pleasure
W:This very night I'll be with my lass.
W:
W:I came unto my true love's window,
W:I knelt down gently upon a stone.
W:'Twas through a pane that I whispered slowly,
W:Saying, "My dear girl, are you alone?"
W:
W:She rose her head from her soft down pillow,
W:Snowy was her milk-white breast,
W:Crying, "Who is there outside my window,
W:That have deprived me of my night's rest?"
W:
W:"It's your true love, do not discover,
W:I pray, love, rise and let me in,
W:I am fatigued after my long journey,
W:Besides I'm wet unto the skin."
W:
W:My love she rose with greatest pleasure,
W:Opening the door for to let me in,
W:We kissed, shook hands, embraced each other,
W:Till that long night were at an end.
W:
W:When that long night were gone and over,
W:The cocks they did begin to crow.
W:We kissed, shook hands, in sorrow parted,
W:I took my leave and away did go.
W:
W:My love has skin as the snow in winter,
W:Her cheeks as red as the rose in June,
W:Her black sparkling eye like a blazing star,
W:In a winter's night and it freezes too.
