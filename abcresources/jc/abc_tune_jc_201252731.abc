This was composed for a great country dancing friend, John Connon of Dufftown, when he celebrated
his 80th birthday in 2003. His dancing friends asked John Drewry to devise a dance (Birlin' Awa')
especially for John's 80th birthday and I was asked to compose a tune for the dance.  As John is
well known for wearing braces with his kilt and for giving his partner a good "birl" when he dances,
the tune title is appropriate.
