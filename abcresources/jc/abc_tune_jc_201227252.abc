w: 1.~It came up-on* the mid-night clear,       That glo-*rious song* of old,*
w: 2.~Still thro' the clo-*ven skies they come, With peace-*ful wings* un-furled,*
w: 3.~Oh, ye, be-neath* life's crush-ing load,  Whose forms* are bend-*ing low,*
w: 4.~For lo! the days* are has-t'ning on,      By proph-*et-bards* fore-told,*

w: From an-gels bend-*ing near the earth    To touch their harps* of gold;*
w: And still their heav'n-*ly mu-sic floats O'er all the wea-*ry world;*
w: Who toil a-long* the climb-ing way       With pain-ful steps* and slow;*
w: When with the ev-*er-cir-cling years     Comes round the age* of gold;*

w: "Peace on the earth,* good-will to men, From heav'n's* all-gra-*cious King."*
w: A-bove its sad* and low-ly plains       They bend* on hov'-*'ring wing,*
w: Look now! for glad* and gold-en hours   Come swift-*ly on* the wing;*
w: When peace shall o-*ver all the earth   Its an-*cient splen-*dors fling;*

w: The world in sol-*emn still-ness lay    To hear the an-*gels sing.*
w: And ev-er o'er* its Bab-el sounds       The bless-ed an-*gels sing.*
w: Oh, rest be-side* the wear-y road,      And hear the an-*gels sing.*
w: And the whole world* send back the song Which now the an-*gels sing.*
