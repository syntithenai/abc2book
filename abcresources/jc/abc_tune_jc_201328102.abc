S: Handwritten MS by Barbara McOwen
N: This "tangled reel"  is  specially  written  for  Lance  Ramshaw,  artificial
N: intelligence  wizard, dance teacher, minister, musician and poet.  Instead of
N: waiting around at a jam session for the piano to be free, he decided to learn
N: the  fiddle,  so  he  could  play  all  the time.  And he is devouring tunes!
N: "Raivlin" is Scots for "a tangled thread," or, "used of rhyme: loose odds and
N: ends" and at his request it is intended to be a fun tune for him to play.
