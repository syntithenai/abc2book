w: Which I nev-er had seen_ be-fore_ Which I nev-er had seen_ be-fore*
W:It's forty miles I've gone today,
W:I spied a cottage on my way,
W:Which I never had seen before,
W:Which I never had seen before.
W:
W:I stepped up to that cottage door,
W:A pretty, fair maid tripped o'er the floor,
W:And she cried aloud, "Who's there?"
W:And she cried aloud, "Who's there?"
W:
W:"My dear, it hails, it rains, it blows,
W:And I've got wet through all my clothes,
W:And I pray you, let me in,
W:And I pray you, let me in."
W:
W:"Oh, no! kind sir, that never can be,
W:For there's no-one in the house but me,
W:And I dare not let you in,
W:And I dare not let you in."
W:
W:I turned me round away to go,
W:When she did sweet compassion bestow,
W:And she called me back again,
W:And she called me back again.
W:
W:We spent that night in sweet content,
W:And the very next morning to church we went,
W:And I made her my lawful bride,
W:And I made her my lawful bride.
