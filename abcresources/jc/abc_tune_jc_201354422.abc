%W:1. Ye nations all, on you I call, come, hear this declaration.
%W:And don't refuse this glorious news of Jesus and salvation.
%W:To royal Jews came first the news of Christ the great Messiah,
%W:As was foretold by prophets old, Isaiah, Jeremiah.
%W:
W:2. To Abraham the promise came, and to his seed for ever,
W:A light to shine in Isaac's line, by scripture we discover;
W:Hail, promised morn! the Savior's born, the glorious Mediator--
W:God's blessed Word made flesh and blood, assumed the human nature.
W:
W:3. His parents poor in earthly store, to entertain the stranger
W:They found no bed to lay his head, but in the ox's manger:
W:No royal things, as used by kings, were seen by those that found him,
W:But in the hay the stranger lay, with swaddling bands around him.
W:
W:4. On the same night a glorious light to shepherds there appeared,
W:Bright angels said, "Be not afraid, although we much alarm you,
W:The angels said, "Be not afraid, although we much alarm you,
W:We do appear good news to bear, as now we will inform you.
W:
W:5. "The city's name is Bethlehem, in which God hath appointed,
W:This glorious morn a Savior's born, for him God hath anointed;
W:By this you'll know, if you will go, to see this little stranger,
W:His lovely charms in Mary's arms, both lying in a manger."
W:
W:6. When this was said, straightway was made a glorious sound from heaven
W:Each flaming tongue an anthem sung, "To men a Savior's given,
W:In Jesus' name, the glorious theme, we elevate our voices,
W:At Jesus' birth be peace on earth, meanwhile all heaven rejoices."
W:
W:7. Then with delight they took their flight, and winged their way to glory,
W:The shepherds gazed and were amazed, to hear the pleasing story;
W:To Bethlehem they quickly came, the glorious news to carry,
W:And in the stall they found them all, Joseph, the Babe, and Mary.
W:
W:8. The shepherds then returned again to their own habitation,
W:With joy of heart they did depart, now they have found salvation.
W:Glory, they cry, to God on high, who sent his Son to save us
W:This glorious morn the Savior's born, his name it is Christ Jesus.
