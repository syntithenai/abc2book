w:And it blew these_ three maid-ens to and fro
W:Three maidens a-milking did go,
W:Three maidens a milking did go;
W:The wind it blew high, and the wind it blew low,
W:And it blew these three maidens to and fro
W:
W:[They met with a man by the way
W: And one of them to him did say
W: Kind sir have you the will, and kind sir have you the skill
W: For to catch little birds off the tree?
W:
W: O yes I will show you some skills
W: And very good skills they be too
W: If you'll come along with me to yonder shady tree
W: I will catch you a small bird or two.
W:
W: To the merry greenwood they all went
W: To the merry greenwood they all went
W: For the birds they did whistle on every green thistle
W: For they very well knew their intent.
W:
W: I laid my love under a bush
W: I laid my love under a tree
W: And he beat at the bush and the bird it did fly in
W: A little above my love's knee.
W:
W: Then her sparkling eyes turned around
W: As if she had been in a swound
W: And she said, upon my word I have caught a little bird
W: Picking upon its own ground.
W:
W: Pretty maidens be ruled by me
W: Pretty maidens be ruled by me
W: Never catch a small bird upon a green ground
W: But catch them upon the green tree.]
