[COMERS_OF_LARGO,_A_REELL]: COMERS OF LARGO, A REELL (sic), THE. Scottish, Air (9/8 time). D Major. Standard tuning. AB. Published by Henry Playford in his 1700 collection of Scottish dance music, and the first use in print of the word reel for a tune title (the tune however is in an odd 9/8 time, not at all what we think of as a reel today but more akin to the triple‑time hornpipe, states Emmerson {1971}). The tune is incomplete, and since it is in 9/8, it is obviously not what we consider today to be a reel, though Alburger thinks it may have been inaccurately recorded from someone's playing. Alburger (Scottish Fiddlers and Their Music), 1983; Ex. 9, pgs. 26‑27.
