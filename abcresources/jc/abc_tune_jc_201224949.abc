%% If you have had very much
%% to do with the Country Cance and Song Society down in
%% Northampton, MA, then most likely you have encountered
%% Ann Pearce in their office, where she is sales manager.
%% I see her quite often at various dance functions, and
%% she is always nice to me. Now it's my turn to be nice to
%% you, Ann!
