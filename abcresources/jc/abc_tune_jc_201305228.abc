C: James MacPherson, 1700
N:
N: Composed and played by James MacPherson, a robber and fiddler, shortly before he was
N: hanged on 16 November 1700. He reportedly played the tune at the scaffold. There is a
N: myth that he destroyed the fiddle so that nobody else could ever play it again. The
N: truth seems to be that he offerred his fiddle to anyone in the crowd. There were no
N: takers, possibly from fear of being considered his friend, so he smashed the fiddle
N: and threw the pieces at the crowd. Part of the story is that the local authorities,
N: fearing the arrival of a reprieve, advanced the clock so as to speed up his execution.
N: The fiddle's remains are in the MacPherson Clan museum at Newtonmore. The
N: published versions of this tune vary widely, not surprisingly for a song air.
