N:The earliest setting of this rare composition which the compiler can
N:trace is that found in Vol.3 of Aird's Selections of Scotch, English,
N:Irish and Foreign Airs, printed in 1788. Slightlly disguised as
N:"Captain Oakhain: A Favorite Irish Tune", it appears in McGoun's
N:Repository of Scots and Irish Airs, Strathspeys, Reels, etc. Glasgow
N:1803", but it is not numbered among the Bunting or Petrie
N:Collections. "The Wounded Hussar" we learn from Alexander
N:Campbell's song of that name printed with the music in Smith's Irish
N:Minstrel, Edinburgh 1825" was Captain Henry O'Kain who died of
N:his wounds on "the banks fo the dark rolling Danube".
N:Included as one of Carolan's compositions in Hardiman's Irish
N:Minstrelsy, 1831" the author adds: "Capt. O'Kane or O'Cahan of a
N:distinguished family, a sporting Irishman well know in Antrim in his
N:day as "Slasher O'Kane'". There can be no doubt that he was
N:the hero of Campbell's song. The Wounded Hussar is also included in
N:Serenne's "Songs of Ireland without words, Edinburgh 1854".
