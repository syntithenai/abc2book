W:"Will come nae muckle speed.
W:We'll cry upon our merry men

W:"Oh na, Oh na", say John the Graham,
W:"That thing can never be.
W:The gallant Grahams were never beat
W:We'll try what we can dee."

W:Sic strokes ye never saw,
W:For ilka sword gaed clash for clash
W:At the battle o' Harlow.
W:
W:The Hielandmen wi' their lang swords
W:They laid on us fu' sair
W:And they drove back oor merry men

W:Brave Forbes to his brother said,
W:"Oh brither don't ye see.
W:They've beat us back on ilka side
W:And we'll be forced to flee."
W:
W:"Oh na, oh na," my brother said,
W:"That thing can never be.
W:You'll take your sword into your hand
W:And ye'll come on wi' me."
W:
W:Then back to back the brithers twa
W:Gaed in among the throng
W:And they laid doon the Hielandmen
W:Wi' swords baith sharp and lang.
W:
W:The first aw stroke that Forbes struck,
W:He gart McDonald reel
W:And the neist ae stroke that Forbes struck,
W:The brave McDonald fell.
W:
W:And siccan a Pitlarichie

W:As was among the Hielandmen
W:When they saw McDonald fa'.
W:
W:And when they saw that he was dead,
W:They turned and ran awa'
