T:Untitled Polka
C:from John W. Summers
H:JWS learned this tune from Tom
H:Riley, fiddler from KY.
N:The figures in the first 2 halves of
N:bars 1 and 2 were frequently used by
N:JWS. The second note is tied to the lower
N:note of the double-stop, while the upper
N:note of the d-s is caught by a scooping
N:down of the bow hand.
