w:fair_ wo-man Lord Thom-as he lov-ed her dear_
W:Lord Thomas he was a bold forester,
W:The chasener of the King's deer.
W:Fair Eleanor she was a fair woman;
W:Lord Thomas he loved her dear.
W:
W:'Oh riddle, Oh riddle, dear mother,' he said,
W:'Oh riddle it both as one,
W:Whether I shall marry fair Ellen or not,
W:And leave the brown girl alone?'
W:
W:'The brown girl she've a-got houses and land,
W:Fair Ellen she've a-got none,
W:Therefore I charge thee to my blessing
W:To bring the brown girl home.'
W:
W:Lord Thomas he went to fair Eleanor's tower.
W:He knocked so loud on the ring.
W:There was none so ready as fair Eleanor's self
W:To let Lord Thomas in.
W:
W:'What news, what news, Lord Thomas?' she said,
W:'What news have you brought to me?'
W:'I've come to invite thee to my wedding
W:Beneath the sycamore tree.'
W:
W:'O God forbid, Lord Thomas,' she said,
W:'That any such thing should be done.
W:I thought to have been the bride myself,
W:And you to have been the groom.'
W:
W:'Oh riddle, Oh riddle, dear mother,' she said,
W:'Oh riddle it both as one,
W:Whether I go to Lord Thomas's wedding,
W:Or better I stay at home?'
W:
W:'There's a hundred of thy friends, dear child,
W:A hundred of thy foes,
W:Therefore I beg thee with all my blessing
W:To Lord Thomas's wedding don't go.'
W:
W:But she dressed herself in her best attire,
W:Her merry men all in green,
W:And every town that she went through,
W:They thought she was some queen.
W:
W:Lord Thomas he took her by the hand,
W:He led her through the hall,
W:And he sat her down in the noblest chair
W:Among the ladies all.
W:
W:'Is this your bride, Lord Thomas ?'she says.
W:'I'm sure she looks wonderful brown,
W:When you used to have the fairest young lady
W:That ever the sun shone on.'
W:
W:'Despise her not,' Lord Thomas he said,
W:'Despise her not unto me.
W:For more do I love your little finger
W:Than all her whole body.'
W:
W:This brown girl she had a little pen-knife
W:Which was both long and sharp.
W:And betwixt the long ribs and the short
W:She pricked fair Eleanor's heart.
W:
W:'Oh, what is the matter?' Lord Thomas he said.
W:'Oh, can you not very well see?
W:Can you not see my own heart's blood
W:Come trickling down my knee?'
W:
W:Lord Thomas's sword is hung by his side,
W:As he walked up and down the hall,
W:And he took off the brown girl's head from her shoulders,
W:And he flung it against the wall.
W:
W:He put the handle to the ground,
W:The sword into his heart.
W:No sooner did three lovers meet,
W:No sooner did they part.
W:
W:Lord Thornas was buried in the church,
W:Fair Eleanor in the choir,
W:And out of her bosom there grew a red rose,
W:And out of Lord Thomas a briar.
W:
W:And it grew till it reached the church steeple top.
W:Where it could grow no higher,
W:And there it entwined like a true lover's knot
W:For all true loves to admire.
