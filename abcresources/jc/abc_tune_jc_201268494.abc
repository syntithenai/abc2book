w:But by your cru-el lan-guage my hopes you would un-do.
W:Come all who hate old Esau and Jacobs cause defend
W:See Jacobs faithful struggle on Esau dont depend
W:Poor Esau's weak and feeble his armour and his shield
W:Is sure to fall in battle and he will have to yield
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:The war is now proclaim-ed the battle is begun
W:I'm bound for full salvation with world and flesh I'm done
W:I'll keep you at a distance to die it is your doom
W:I'll never shed a tear for you but lay you in the tomb.
W:
W:(Esau:)
W:My state is truly awful 'tis more than I can bear
W:You doom me to destruction I'm almost in despair
W:I want to have salvation and go to heaven too
W:But by your cruel language my hopes you would undo.
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:Heaven is not intended for such a wretch as you
W:There is a place prepared for all old Adam's crew
W:I want none of your snuffles your talk will all be vain
W:I doom you to destruction with your old Brother Cain.
W:
W:(Esau:)
W:O listen to my story and hear me plead my right
W:See what I've suffred with dont bring me to the light
W:I want to be concealed dont bring me to disgrace,
W:I want to have salvation when I have run my race.
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:Your race will soon be ended Salvation's not for you
W:For death it is your portion my strength I will renew
W:I'll slay you in the battle your torment I'll increase
W:Now give up for you're undone you never shall have peace.
W:
W:(Esau:)
W:You treat me more than cruel in anguish I lament
W:You will not have compassion altho' I do repent.
W:If I pour out my sorrow and tell you of my pain
W:I find you're so hard hearted your pity I cant gain
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:Pity is not intended for any of your race
W:Destruction is determined to meet you in the face
W:You need not plead your sorrow nor tell of my hard heart
W:I'm hard enough to tell you from me you shall depart.
W:
W:(Esau:)
W:I'm troubled to the centre I wont consent to die
W:It looks like cruel murder you set me in a fry.
W:I have been your companion and led you at my will
W:And now you're se hard hearted my blood you want to spill.
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:Your blood it shall be spilled the least and last remains
W:Now you may give the ghost up you surely shall be slain
W:This is not all your portion to hell you've got to go
W:With all your generation your doom'd to endless wo
W:
W:(Esau:)
W:My troubles are enlarged forever I'm undone
W:I'll plead no more for favor I'm done I'm done I'm done,
W:I ask no more salvation I yield I yield I yield
W:I'm sure to have damnation for I have left the field.
W:
W:(Jacob:)
W:The battle is decided Old Esau's left the field
W:No thanks for your surrender you was obliged to yield
W:Now I'll go on to conquer dont think to rise again
W:I have got on the armour and I intend to reign.
