w:The_ Fa-ther_ and the Son
W:There is six good days all in the week,   
W:All for a labouring man,
W:But the seventh is the Sabbath of our Lord Jesus Christ,
W:The Father and the Son.
W:
W:On Sunday go to Church, dear man;
W:Down on our knees we must fall,
W:And then we must pray that the Lord Jesus Christ
W:He will bless and save us all.
W:
W:Bring up your children well, dear man,
W:Whilst they are in their youth,
W:For it might be the better for your sweet soul
W:When you go to the Lord {Jesus Christ/of Truth}
W:
W:Now the fields they are as green, as green,
W:As green as any leaf,
W:Our Lord our God He has watered them
W:With the heavenly dew so sweet.
W:
W:In hell it is dark, in hell it is dim,
W:In hell it is full of lies;
W:And that is the place where all wicked men must go
W:When they part from the Lord Jesus Christ.
W:
W:Then take your Bible in your hand
W:And read your chapter through;
W:And when the day of Judgement comes,
W:The Lord will remember you.
W:
W:Then bring us some of your Christmas ale,
W:And likewise your Christmas beer;
W:For when another Christmas comes
W:We may not all be here.
W:
W:With one stone at your head, oh man,
W:And another stone at your feet.
W:Your good deeds and your eil
W:Will all together meet.
