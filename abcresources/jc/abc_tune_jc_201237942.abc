T:Anselm Lingnau's Compliments to Rik de Vroome

H:Rik de Vroome from Aalst Waalre, The Netherlands,
likes to compose tunes and devise dances.
I wrote this tune for him because he especially seems to fancy hornpipe tunes.
With the broken rhythm, this tune is nice to play more slowly and listen to,
but if it is played faster and as just mostly eighth notes
it could also serve as a dance tune.
