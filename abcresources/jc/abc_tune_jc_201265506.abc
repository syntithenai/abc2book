W:
W:There lived a lady by the North Sea shore.
W:  Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W:Two daughters were the babes she bore.
W:  Fa la la la la la la la la la
W:
W:As one grew bright as in the sun,
W:so coal black grew the other one.
W:
W:A knight came riding to the lady's door.
W:He'd travelled far to be their wooer.
W:
W:He courted one with gloves and rings,
W:but loved the other above all things.
W:
W:Oh sister will you go with me
W:to watch the ships sail on the sea?
W:
W:She took her sister by the hand
W:and led her down to the North Sea strand.
W:
W:And as they stood on the windy shore,
W:the dark girl threw her sister o'er.
W:
W:Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam,
W:crying "sister, reach to me your hand.
W:
W:Oh sister, sister let me live,
W:and all that's mine I'll surely give."
W:
W:"It's your truelove I'll have and more,
W:but thou shalt never come ashore."
W:
W:And there she floated like a swan.
W:The salt sea bore her body on.
W:
W:Two minstrels walked along the strand
W:and saw the maiden float to land.
W:
W:They made a harp of her breast bone
W:whose sound would melt a heart of stone.
W:
W:They took three locks of her yellow hair
W:and with them strung the harp so rare.
W:
W:They went into her father's hall
W:to play the harp before them all.
W:
W:But as they laid it on a stone,
W:the harp began to play alone.
W:
W:The first string sang a doleful sound;
W:The bride her younger sister drwoned.
W:
W:The second string as that they tried,
W:in terror sits the black-haired bride.
W:
W:The third string sang beneath their bow,
W:and surely now her tears will flow.
