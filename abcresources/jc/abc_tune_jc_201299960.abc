W:1.On the moonlight shores of Lake Dore
W:  On a night that was made for romance
W:  Let me tell of a real true love story
W:  Of a boy and a girl at a dance
W:2.They were only a couple of strangers
W:  Dancing forgetting all faults
W:  But a friendship was made while the orchestra played
W:  The beautiful Lake Dore waltz
W:3.He came from the city, she came from the farm
W:  He thought she was pretty, and she fell for his charm
W:  On the moonlight shores of Lake Dore
W:  They met in a waltz just by chance
W:  And there is the real true love story
W:  Of a boy and a girl at dance
W:4.While dancing together, he asked for her hand
W:  She smiled at him sweetly, and then they both smiled up at the band
W:  Now every Saturday night you will find them
W:  Dancing forgetting all faults
W:  And they always stay just to hear the band play
W:  The beautiful Lake Dore waltz
