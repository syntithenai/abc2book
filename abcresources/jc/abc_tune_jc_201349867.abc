%W:I'll never forget the day I went and join'd the "Ninety third"
%W:The chums I used to run with said they thought I look'd absurd.
%W:As they saluted me, and gather'd round me in a ring,
%W:And as I wagg'd my tartan kilt they a' began to sing -
%W:   Chorus:
%W:He's a braw braw Hielan' laddie, Private Jock McDade.
%W:There's not anither soger like him in the Scotch Brigade.
%W:Rear'd amang the heather, you can see he's Scottish built,
%W:By the wig, wig, wiggle, wiggle, waggle o' the kilt.

%W:I'll never forget the day we were order'd on review.
%W:The king came down to see us, and the queen was with him too.
%W:As I march'd by the royal coach the king just shook his head.
%W:The queen put on her royal spec's and look'd at me and said -
%W:   -- Chorus --
%W:I'll never forget the day we went away to camp.
%W:But the sun was hot, I drank a lot, I was nearly dead with cramp.
%W:I'm very nearly certain sure I would have died that day,
%W:But the thing that saved my life was when the band began to play-
%W:   -- Chorus --
