w:sTo see if I could find_ my bon-ny black hare.
W:One morning in Autumn by the dawn of the day,
W:With my gun in good order I straight took my way;
W:To hunt for some game to the woods I did steer,
W:To see if I could find my bonny black hare.
W:
W:I met a young damsel, her eyes black as sloes,
W:Her teeth white as ivory, her cheeks like the rose,
W:Her hair hung in ringlets on her shoulders bare,
W:"Sweet maiden," I cried, "did you see my black hare?
W:
W:This morning a-hunting I have been all round,
W:But my bonny black hare is not to be found."
W:The maiden she then answer'd, and at him did stare,
W:"I never yet heard of - or saw - a black hare."
W:
W:"I think you are deceitful, young maid," he did say,
W:"My bonny black hare I am told pass'd this way;
W:And you have decoy'd me, I vow and declare,
W:You shall go with me for to hunt the black hare.
W:
W:My gun in good order, my balls are also,
W:And under your smock I was told she did go.
W:So delay me no longer, I cannot stop here,
W:One shot I will fire at your bonny black hare."
W:
W:His gun he then loaded, determin'd he was,
W:And instantly laid her down on the green grass;
W:His trigger he drew, put his balls in her ear,
W:And fired one shot at her bonny black hare.
W:
W:Her eyes they did twinkle, and smiling did say:
W:"How oft, dearest sportsman, do you come this way?
W:There is few in this country can with you compare,
W:So fire once again at my bonny black hare."
W:
W:His gun he reloaded and fired once more,
W:She cried, "Draw your trigger and never give o'er.
W:Your powder and and balls are so sweet, I declare,
W:Keep shooting away at my bonny black hare."
W:
W:He said, "My dear maiden, my powder is all done,
W:My gun is out of order, I cannot ram home,
W:But meet me tomorrow, my darling so fair,
W:And I'll fire once again at your bonny black hare."
