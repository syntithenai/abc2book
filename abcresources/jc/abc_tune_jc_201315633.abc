W:O where are you roaming this long weary day?
W:I am waiting by the water down here at the bay.
W:Where the wind and the waves seem to whisper of joy
W:While I wait and I long for my own pretty boy.
W:
W:You told me you loved me down here by the bay,
W:And then with the flood-tide your boat sailed away,
W:Now darkness has fallen, the boats are all home;
W:But my own pretty boy is afar on the foam.
W:
W:You promised me riches and dresses so fine,
W:And a little white cottage and all to be mine,
W:Now the waves seem to mock all my joy,
W:As I wait here and long for my own pretty boy.
