W:2.When Fergus, the first of our kings, I suppose,
W:  At the head of his nobles had vanquish'd our foes,
W:  Just before they began, they'd been feasting on brose.
W:      O! the kail-brose, &c.
W:
W:3.Our sodgers were drest in their kilts and short hose,
W:  Wi' their bonnets and belts, which their dress did compose,
W:  And a bag of oat-meal on their backs to be brose.
W:      O! the kail-brose, &c.

W:4.At our annual elections for bailies or mayor,
W:  Nae kickshaws o' puddings or tarts were seen there;
W:  But a cog o" gude brose was the favourite fare.

W:  We've lost a great deal o' our relish for brose.

W:  Likes always to feast on a cog o' gude brose;
W:  And thanks be to heav'n, we've yet plenty of those.
W:      O! the kail-brose, &c.
