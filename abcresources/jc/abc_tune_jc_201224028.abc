%% I'd like to send my thanks down to Chris Abell of Concord, MA, for a lot of
%% hard work. He made All of Sarah Bauhan's beautiful whistles and rebuilt
%% part of her great Haines wooden flute, so I guess it would be fair to say
%% that he has been (forgive me!) instrumental to her success. I hope this
%% tune sounds OK in your shop, Chris!
