W:We will boast of our fine wool and cheese.

W:(Chorus)
W:Our sweet shepherdess then will we chorus amain,
W:And rejoice in our dairymaid's praise,
W:Our dairymaid's praise, dairymaid's praise;
W:Our sweet pretty dairymaid's praise.

W:Should your wishes incline to beer, cider or wine,
W:As you sit with your pipe at your ease,
W:Their true flavour to find always keep this in mind,
W:Clear your taste with a bit of old cheese.
W:
W:Like Gloucester Noke, we'll sing and we'll joke,
W:And be merry whenever we please,
W:Drink the fleece and the pail, the plough and the flail,
W:O'er a relish of best making cheese.
W:
W:Join hands then, unite with joy and delight,
W:This happy occasion we'll seize,
W:And with am'rous desire we will drik "May our Squire
W:Live long, and enjoy his own cheese!"
