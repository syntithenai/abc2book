H:I composed this tune to provide original music for a dance which
Torsten Stein dedicated to his wife, Alexandra.
I'd already written another tune for Alexandra
(see Scotch Snap Leaflet \#1),
and so I had to think of a different title for this one!
At the time in question -- a couple of months before their wedding --,
Alexandra used to live in Hamburg, which necessitated quite a
bit of travelling if the two were to spend any time together.
Therefore I've decided to name this dance in honour of the good
offices of the `Deutsche Bahn';
imagine Torsten riding on the `Hamburg train' on a sunny Saturday morning
in May, a little restless and full of anticipation of another wonderful
weekend\dots
