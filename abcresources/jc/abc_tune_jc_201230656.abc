%% Max Nunemacher sure 
%% rates a tune. In the first place, he's a good friend of Lisa
%% Sieverts; in the second place, he's a regular at the
%% Monday Night Dance in Nelson (so's Lisa!), so it's
%% obvious (to me at least!) that you ought to have a tune,
%% Max, so here it is! I hope it works for you!
