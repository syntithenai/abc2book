W:So I gaed up tae Ainsty fee
W:Ma fortune for tae chase

W:I met wiâ?? Adam Mitchell
W:And tae fee we did presume
W:Heâ??s a fairmer up Kinethmont way
W:At a place caâ??d Sleepytoon
W:
W:â??If ye and I agreeâ? said he
W:â??I promise ye fair play,
W:For I never gar ma servants work
W:mair nor ten â??oors a dayâ?
W:
W:â??Yeâ??ll work well when the day is fine
W:In rain ye shall work none.
W:A regular diet ye shall hae
W:And wages when theyâ??re won.â?
W:
W:â??If aâ?? be true ye tell tae me
W:I think the place might suitâ?
W:Says I, â??Iâ??ll gang wiâ?? you
W:although ye are an ugly brute.â?
W:
W:So I agreed tae fee wiâ?? him
W:Anâ?? thocht masel well kent
W:Until I got tae Sleepytoon
W:And there I did repent
W:
W:The order was tae yoke at five
W:And work while we could see
W:â??Oh no! youâ??re not in order Sir,
W:Defied ye maun beâ?
W:
W:â??Will ye defy what I command,
W:Ye scoundrel that ye are?
W:Ten â??oors a day did we agree
W:Deny it if ye daur.â?
W:
W:Next order was tae bed at nine
W:And never leave the toon
W:And ilka time we left it
W:Weâ??d be fined half a croon
W:
W:But we took little heed oâ?? that
W:And oftimes took the pass
W:Sometimes tae buy tobacco
W:And sometimes tae court a lass
W:
W:The ither lads were often fined
W:But never lost the hairt
W:And I maself was fined a croon
W:For riding in the cairt
W:
W:And noo the term is nearly done
W:And soon we shall be free
W:And wiâ?? that wary fairmer
W:I never more will fee.
W:
W:And noo the term is over
W:And oor wages we hae won
W:So weâ??ll awaâ?? tae Rhynie mere
W:And hae oorselves some fun
W:
W:Maybe weâ??ll see old Adam,
W:Suppinâ?? at his brose.
W:Iâ??ll gie him a lenâ?? o' ma hankie
W:For tae dicht his snotty nose
