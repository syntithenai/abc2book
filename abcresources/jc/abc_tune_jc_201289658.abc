w:A-*las I must live all a-lone *
W:As I was a-walking one morning by chance,
W:I heard a maid making her moan.
W:I asked why she sighed and she sadly replied,
W:"Alas I must live all alone, alone,
W:Alis! I must live all alone!"
W:
W:I said, "My fair maid, pray whence have you strayed?
W:And are you some distance from home?"
W:"My home," replied she, "is a burden to me,
W:For there I must live all alone, alone,
W:For there I must live all alone!"
W:
W:"When I was eleven I had sweethearts seven,
W:And then I would look upon none;
W:But now all in vain I must sigh and complain,
W:For my true love has left me alone, alone,
W:For my true love has left me alone!"
W:
W:"Oh! Come back from sea, my dear Johnny to me,
W:And make me a bride of your own!
W:Or else for your sake my poor heart it will break,
W:And here I will die all alone, alone,
W:And here I shall die all alone."
