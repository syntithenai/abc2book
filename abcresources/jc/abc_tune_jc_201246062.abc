W:All on a misty morning, when cloudy was the weather,
W:I met an old man walking that cloth-ed was in leather
W:And ne'er a shirt upon his back but wool unto his skin,
W:With, how d'ye do? and how d'ye do?And how d'ye do again?

W:I went a little further,And there I met a maid
W:Was going then a-milking, A-milking, Sir, she said;
W:Then I began to compliment, and she began to sing;
W:With, How do you do? (etc)
W:
W:I told her I would married be, and she should be my bride,
W:And long we should not tarry, and twenty things beside;
W:I'll plow and sow and reap and mow, while thou shalt sit and spin;
W:With, How do you do? (etc)
W:
W:Kind Sir, I have a mother, beside a father still;
W:These freinds above all other, pray ask for their good will;
W:For if I be undutiful to them, it is a sin;
W:With, how do you do? (etc)
W:
W:Her parents being willing, the parties were agreed,
W:Her portion thirty shilling, we married were with speed;
W:Then Will the piper he did play, the others dance and sing,
W:With, How do you do? (etc)
W:
W:Then lusty Ralph and Robin, with many damsels gay,
W:Did ride on Roan and Dobbin, to celebrate the day;
W:When being met together, their caps they off did fling,
W:With, How do you do? (etc)
