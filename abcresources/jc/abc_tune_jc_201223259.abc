%% Luther Block really
%% deserves a tune. I mean _really_! If you've ever
%% seen him in action, you know what I mean -
%% he's one of the hardest workers I ever saw. The great
%% West Coast Dance scene would not be what it is today
%% without him. Thanks a lot, Luther, for all you have
%% done for all of us.
