%% Charlie Pilzer is one of the
%% east coast's great musicians (bass and button box) and
%% every once in a while it's been my great good fortune
%% to play a few tunes with him. He and lovely wife
%% Cecily and their cute daughter live in Tacoma Park, MD,
%% where they operate a B+B for grateful itinerant musicians.
%% =Thanks=, you guys!
