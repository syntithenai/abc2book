W:I am a man of constant sorrow
W:And I've seen troubles all my days.
W:I'll bid farewell to old Kentucky
W:the state where I was born and raised.

W:All through this world I'm bound to ramble,
W:Through sun and wind and driving rain,
W:I'm bound to ride the northwest railway,
W:Perhaps I'll make the very next train.

W:There is a promise that is given,
W:I'll see you on God's golden shore.
