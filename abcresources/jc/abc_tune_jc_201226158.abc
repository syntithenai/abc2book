%% Walt Michael, from Cold Spring,
%% NY, had a great deal to do with getting the Shetland fiddlers over here
%% last summer, and I've been grateful to him ever since. We were able
%% to listen to some of the best fiddle music I've ever heard, and we've got
%% Walt to thank for it. When he and his group (Walt Michael and Company)
%% joined in with the Shetlanders, the music was out of this world. Thanks,
%% Walt, for giving us all such a wonderful treat --
