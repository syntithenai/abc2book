W:I've been to the wars and I've lost one leg,
W:While fighting over the ocean,
W:I fought for king and country too,
W:Won honour and promotion,
W:So my jolly, jolly crew,
W:I'll bid you all adieu
W:No more to the wars will I go with you,
W:But I'll travel the country through and through,
W:And still be a rambling soldier
W:
W:And if anybody here wants to know my name,
W:My name it is Ben Johnson,
W:I have a message from the King
W:To court all girls that are handsome,
W:To court 'em all both old and young,
W:To court 'em all and marry none
W:To court 'em all and amrry marry none
W:And still be a rambling soldier
