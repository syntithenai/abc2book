w:And_ glint-in' is his hawk-ing e'e Wi'_ kind-love dwell-ing there
W:Oh! Derwentwater's a bonny lord,
W:And golden is his hair,
W:And glintin' is his hawkin' e'e
W:Wi' kind love dwelling there.
W:
W:Yestreen he cam to out lord's yett,
W:And loud, loud, did he ca',
W:"Rise up, rise up, for good King James,
W:And buckle and come awa'."
W:
W:Our ladie held by our good lord,
W:Wi' weel love-locket hands,
W:But when young Derwentwater came,
W:She loos'd the snawy bands.
W:
W:And when young Derwentwater kneeled -
W:"My gentle, fair ladie,"
W:The tears gave way to the glow o' love
W:In our gude ladie's e'e.
W:
W:"I will think," he said, "on those e'en o' blue,
W:And on this snawy hand,
W:When on the helmy ridge o' war
W:Comes down my burly brand."
W:
W:O never a word our ladie spake,
W:And he pressed her snawy hand,
W:"But O, my Derwentwater!" she sighed,
W:When his glowing lips she fand.
W:
W:He has drapp'd frae his hand his tassel o' gowd,
W:Which knots his gude weir-glove,
W:And he has drapp'd a spark frae his e'en,
W:Which gars our ladie love.
W:
W:"Come down, come down," our gude lord says,
W:"Come down, my fair ladie,
W:O dinna young Derwentwater stop,
W:The morning sun is hie."
W:
W:And hie, hie, rose the morning sun,
W:Wi' front o' ruddie blude -
W:The harlot front, frae the white curtain,
W:Betokens naething gude.
W:
W:Our ladie look'd frae the turret top,
W:As long as she could see,
W:And for every sigh for her gude lord,
W:For Derwent there were three.
