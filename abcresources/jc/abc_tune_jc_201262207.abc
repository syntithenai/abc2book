W:1.
W: My (D)name is Francis (Bm)Tolliver. I (G)come from Liver(Em)pool.
W: Two (A)years ago the war was waiting (G)for me after (D)school.
W: To Belgium and to (Bm)Flanders, to (G)Germany to (Em)here,
W: I (A)fought for King and country I love (D)dear.
W: It was (A)Christmas in the trenches where the (G)frost so bitter (D)hung.
W: The (Bm)frozen fields of (F#m)France were still, no (G)Christmas song was (A)sung.
W: Our (D)families back in (Bm)England were (G)toasting us that (Em)day,
W: Their (A)brave and glorious lads so far a(D)way.
W:2.
W: I was (D)lyin' with my (Bm)mess-mate on the (G)cold and rocky (Em)ground
W: When a(A)cross the lines of battle came a (G)most peculiar (D)sound.
W: Says I "Now listen (Bm)up me boy", each (G)soldier strained to (Em)hear
W: As (A)one young German voice sang out so (D)clear.
W: "He's (A)singin' bloody well you know", my (G)partner says to (D)me.
W: Soon (Bm)one by one each (F#m)German voice (G)joined in in harmo(A)ny.
W: The (D)cannons rested (Bm)silent. The (G)gas cloud rolled no (Em)more
W: As (A)Christmas brought us respite from the (D)war.
W:3.
W: As (D)soon as they were (Bm)finished a (G)reverent pause was (Em)spent.
W: 'God (A)rest ye merry ,gentlemen' struck (G)up some lads from (D)Kent.
W: The next they sang was (Bm)"Stille Nacht". "T'is (G)'Silent Night'" says (Em)I
W: And (A)in two toungues one song filled up that (D)sky.
W: "There's (A)someone commin' towards us" the (G) front-line sentry (D)cried.
W: All (Bm)sights were fixed on (F#m)one lone figure (G)trudging from their (A)side.
W: His (D)truce flag, like a (Bm)Christmas star, shone (G)on that plain so (Em)bright
W: As he (A)bravely strode, unarmed,  into the (D)night.
W:4.
W: Then (D)one by one on (Bm)either side walked (G)into no-mans-(Em)land
W: With (A)neither gun nor bayonet we (G)met there hand to (D)hand.
W: We shared some secret (Bm)brandy and (G)wished each other (Em)well
W: And in a (A)flare-lit soccer game we gave 'em (D)hell.
W: We (A)traded chocolates, cigarettes and (G)photographs from (D)home
W: These (Bm)sons and fathers (F#m)far away from (G)families of their (A)own.
W: Young (D)Sanders played his (Bm)squeeze box and they (G)had a vio(Em)lin
W: This (A)curious and unlikely band of (D)men.

W: Soon (D)daylight stole u(Bm)pon us and (G)France was France once (Em)more.
W: With (A)sad farewells we each began to (G)settle back to (D)war.
W: But the question haunted (Bm)every heart that (G)lived that wonderous (Em)night
W: "Whose (A)family have I fixed within my (D)sights?"
W: It was (A)Christmas in the trenches where the (G)frost so bitter (D)hung.
W: The (Bm)frozen fields of (F#m)France were warmed as (G)songs of peace were (A)sung.
W: For the (D)walls they'd kept bet(Bm)ween us to e(G)xact the work of (Em)war
W: Had been (A)crumbled and were gone forever (D)more.
