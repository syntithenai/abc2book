W:Once in a blythe greenwood
W:Lived a hermit wise and good
W:Whom the folks from far and near
W:For his council sought,
W:Knowing well that what he taught
W:The dreariest of hearts would cheer.
W:Though his hair was white
W:His eye was clear and bright,
W:And he thus was ever wont to say:
W:Though to care we are born,
W:Yet the dullest morn
W:Often heralds in the fairest day!"
W:
W:"The very longest lane,
W:Has a turning, it is plain,
W:E'en the blackest of clouds will fly:
W:And what can't be cured
W:Must with patience be endured:
W:As cheaply can we laugh as cry."
W:And people gazed,
W:At words so deep amazed,
W:While the Sage went on to say:
W:"Though to care (etc)
W:
W:Pray, is the hermit dead?
W:From the forest has he fled?
W:No, he lives to counsel all
W:Who an ear will lend
W:To their wisest, truest friend,
W:And Hope the Hermit's name they call.
W:Still he sits, I ween,
W:'Mid branches ever green,
W:And cheerly you may hear him say:
W:"Though to care (etc)
