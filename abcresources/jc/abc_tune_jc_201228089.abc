%% Niki Tatro started
%% showing up at area contradances in the last year or so,
%% and boy, is she having fun! In fact, she's having such a
%% good time that I thought she needed a tune of her own to
%% dance to. So here, it is, Niki, and I hope you like it. Maybe
%% somebody will play it for you on their fiddle!
