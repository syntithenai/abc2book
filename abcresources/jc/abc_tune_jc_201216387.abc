The Sheel Raa Flood
For notation click here
For midi sound click here
Se lang as aa live, aa' niver forget,
One Saturda when it was se wet;
Iverybody was nearly bet,
Frae the Saturda till the Sunda O!
The ducks did quack an' the cocks did craa,
For what was up they didn't knna;
It nearly droonded all Sheel Raa
That nasty Sunda mornin O!
Mall Johnson tiv hor husband sais,
Reach me me stockins an' me stays;
For God sake, let us have me claes,
Or else we'aal be droonded O!
Thi claes, said he, they're gyen wi' mine,
Like Boyd an' Elliot, up the Tyne;
Aa've leuked fra five, an' noo it's mine,
This nasty Sunda morning O!
On the bed she began to rowl,
An flung hor airms aroond the powl,
(powl-pole-bedpost)
Sayin, Lord hae mercy on me sowl,
This nasty Sunda mornin O!
the vary cats they ran upstairs,
Got on their knees te say thor prayers,
Thinkin they wor gone for fairs,
That nasty Sunda mornin O!
Aa was sorry fur Sally Clark;
The fire was oot, an'aal was dark;
She got oot o' bed wi' nowt but hor sark,
That nasty Sunda morning O!
She made a splash wi' sic a clatter.
That Bob cried oot, Sal, what's the matter?
She sais, Aa's up te me eyes in watter
It must be a nasty mornin O!
Bob jomped oot of his bed an 'aal,
He went wherever he hord her squaal,
But the watter was always shiftin Sal,
That nasty Sunda mornin O!
At last the water burst oppen the door,
An' weshed both Bob and hor;
At Tinmuth tha were washed ashore,
That nasty Sunda morning O!
