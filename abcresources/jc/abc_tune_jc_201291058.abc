% % What a wonderful place! I hope that, some day,
% % you, too, can go there. Sarah Bauhan[?] took me there on the best vacation
% % I ever had. We stayed with the Iain Bains at Acheronic, and were (and still
% % are) most grateful for their hospitality; we enjoyed beautiful scenery and great boat
% % rides; ate haggis (yummy) and roast beef and broiled salmon (more
% % yummy!); we played music with good friends at pubs, and I can
% % tell you right now that, for as long as I live, part of me will be in the Isle of
% % Mull, and part of Mull will always be with me.
