W:Each night as I lay on my pillow
W:My bosom it heaves with a sigh,
W:I think of each angry willow (? billow)
W:And I'm watching the clouds in the sky.
W:Some say that my love is returning
W:To his own native country and me,
W:So blow gently the winds of the ocean
W:And send back my Johnny to me.
W:
W:He's gone for his fortune to better
W:I know that he's gone for my sake.
W:I'll soon be receiving a letter
W:Or else my poor heart it will break.
W:Some say that my love is returning
W:To his own native country and me,
W:So blow gently the winds of the ocean
W:And send back my Johnny to me.
