w: I'll sit and weep down by his_ grave For_ twelve months_ and_ a day.
W:Cold blows the wind o'er my true love
W:Cold blows the drops of rain;
W:I never, never had but one true love,
W:And in Camvile he was slain.
W:I'll do as much for my true love
W:As any young girl may,
W:I'll sit and weep down by his grave
W:For twelve months and a day.
W:
W:But when twelve months were come and gone,
W:This young man he arose,
W:"What makes you weep down by my grave?
W:I can't take my repose."
W:"One kiss, one kiss of your lily-white lips,
W:One kiss is all I crave;
W:One kiss, one kiss of your lily-white lips
W:And return back to your grave."
W:
W:"My lips they are as cold as clay
W:My breath is heavy and strong;
W:If thou wast to kiss my lily-white lips,
W:Thy days would not be long!"
W:"O don't you remember the garden grove,
W:Where we was used to walk?
W:Pluck the finest flower of them all
W:'Twill wither to a stalk."
W:
W:"Go fetch me a nut from a dungeon keep
W:And water from a stone,
W:And white milk froma maiden's breast
W:That babe bare never none."
W:"Go dig me a grave both wide, and deep,
W:(As quickey as you may)
W:I will lie down in it and take one sleep
W:For a twelve month and a day."
