W:Three gipsies stood at the Castle gate,
W:They sang so high, they sang so low,
W:The lady sate in her chamber late,
W:Her heart it melted away as snow,
W:Her heart it melted away as snow.
W:
W:They sang so sweet; they sang so shrill,
W:That fast her tears began to flow.
W:And she laid down her silken gown,
W:Her golden rings and all her show,
W:All her show &c.
W:
W:She plucked off her high-heeled shoes,
W:A-made of Spanish leather, o.
W:She would in the street; with her bare, bare feet;
W:All out in the wind and the weather, O.
W:Weather, O! &c.
