%% I went to my first dance
%% (we called them Square Dances back then) in Francestown, and very
%% soon became a regular because it was such fun. Part of the
%% pleasure was waltzing with Mrs. St. John; she was a very very
%% large lady, but she was an absolute feather on her feet. I have
%% never known anyone who could waltz like that wonderful woman,
%% and I always looked forward to dancing with her. Perhaps, some day, in
%% a far-away place, we'll do it again. I do hope so, Mrs. St. John.
