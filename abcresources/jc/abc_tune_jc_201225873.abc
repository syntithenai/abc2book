%% Back in 1975, Jack Sloanaker had
%% a Fife and Drum Corps down in Lincoln, MA, and Brian Flannery
%% was one of his drummers. Brian was kind enough to write out
%% the drum part to "Fife and Drum" (Bk 1/2 Comb.) for me in invisible
%% ink, so by way of thanks, here's a tune for you, Brian. Hope you're
%% still keeping the beat!
