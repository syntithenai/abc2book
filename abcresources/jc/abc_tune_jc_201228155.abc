%% Up in Newport, H.H. is
%% where the Orzechowski family lives (You have already met
%% them in these tune books.) The Sugar River runs right
%% past their house, and Jane, Francis, Russell, Sophie, and
%% Neil are all members of the Sugar River Band. They have
%% a wonderful time together, making good music for Contra
%% Dances. You should go hear them the next time you are
%% up their way. Bring your
%% dancing shoes, too - you'll
%% need them!
