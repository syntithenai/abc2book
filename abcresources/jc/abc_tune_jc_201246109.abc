w:All round my hat for a twelve-month and a day:

w:It's all be-cause my true love is far, far a-way.
W:All round my hat, I will wear the green willow,
W:All round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day:
W:If anybody asks me the reason why I wear it,
W:Its all because my true love is far, far away.
W:
W:My love she was fair, and my love she was kind, too,
W:And many were the happy hours between my love and me;
W:I never could refuse her whatever she'd a mind to,
W:But now she's far away, far across the stormy sea.
W:
W:O will my love be true, and will my love be faithful?
W:Or will she find another swain to court her where she's gone?
W:The men will all run after her, so pretty and so graceful,
W:And perhaps she may forget me, lamenting all alone.
W:
W:So all round my hat I will wear a green willow,
W:All round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day:
W:And if anybody asks me the reason why I wear it.
W:Its all because my true love is far, far away.
