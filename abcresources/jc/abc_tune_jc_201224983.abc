%% From Philly comes Danny Flynn,
%% bringing his beautiful accordion with him, and boy! can he play
%% it! We get together every so often, at Augusta, or the Philly
%% Festival, or the Mermaid, and we do have such a good time, the
%% bunch of us, and we're all into Irish style, and it's great fun. How
%% lucky we all are to be together in this wonderful thing we enjoy so
%% much. See you at Augusta, Danny!
