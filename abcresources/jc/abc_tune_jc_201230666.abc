%% When I came out
%% to the Northwest Folklife Festival in Seattle this year,
%% Marcy Kubbs introduced me to her dad, Jim Kubbs.
%% He pretty much glued himself to the Roadhouse Stage,
%% and enjoyed listening to the music so much that I thought
%% he might like a tune of his own. Marcy told me she played
%% it for him on her fiddle. Thanks loads, Marcy!
