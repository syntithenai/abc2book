W: Come all you fellows from far and near and listen to my story
W: I’ll tell you about the plans I made to fool Miss Katie Morey
   W: Chorus
W: Tee oo da roddle neck tee I ay hay rye o
W:
W: I went down to Miss Katie’s house just like some clever feller
W: I told her that the plums and grapes was getting ripe and meller
W:
W: I told her that her sister Nan, that lived in yander holler
W: Had sent for her to come down there and stay on half an hour
W:
W: As we went a walking through the field, she squeezed my hand with fear sir,
W: Saying Mama she will come this way and she will catch us here sir
W:
W: If you will climb up yonder tree and see if she is near sir
W: Then we’ll go to that pretty grove and court and sport an hour
W:
W: Oh how he heaved to climb that tree till he was nearly winded
W: Miss Katie stood and smiled and watched to see how high he ascended
W:
W: His heart was thumping in his chest till the tree was gently swaying
W: As Miss Katie smiled and watched, he could what she was saying
W:
W: Your ugly looks I do despise, you look just like an owl sir
W: Now you scratch down like you scratched up, for I’m going back to the house sir
