%% meet up with R.P. Although he lives up in Concord, just an hour
%% from here, about the only time our paths cross is atfestivals and
%% such. He is a great musician, playing hammered dulcimer and
%% harpsichord, and I love to listen to his bautiful tapes. Best
%% Wishes always to you, RP - see you in West Virginia this summer!
