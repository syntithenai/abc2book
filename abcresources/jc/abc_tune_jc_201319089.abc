w:Oh no, John, no, John, no_ John, no!
W:
W:On yonder hill there stands a creature,
W:Who she is I do not know
W:I will court her for her beauty,
W:She must answer yes or no
W:  Oh no, John, no, John, no, John, no!
W:
W:My father was a Spanish Captain,
W:Went to sea a month ago
W:First he kissed me, then he left me,
W:Bid me always answer no
W:  Oh no, John...
W:
W:Oh madam in your face is beauty,
W:On your lips red roses grow
W:Will you take me for your lover,
W:Madam answer yes or no
W:  Oh no, John...
W:
W:Oh madam I will give you jewels,
W:I will make you rich and free
W:I will give you silken dresses,
W:Madam will you marry me?
W:  Oh no, John...
W:
W:Oh madam since you are so cruel,
W:And that you do scorn me so
W:If I may not be your lover,
W:Madam will you let me go?
W:  Oh no, John...
W:
W:Then I will stay with you forever,
W:If you will not be unkind
W:Madam I have vowed to love you,
W:Would you have me change my mind?
W:  Oh no, John...
W:
W:Oh hark, I hear the churchbells ringing,
W:Will you come and be my wife?
W:Or dear madam, have you settled,
W:To live single all your life?
W:  Oh no, John...
