%% Well, today does happen to be Chelsea Clinton's
%% 13th birthday, so "Happy Birthday, Chelsea!", but that isn't why
%% I wrote this tune. There's a "President Garfield's Hornpipe" that's pretty
%% well known here in New England, and since I am such a strong
%% believer in and supporter of our new president, I just felt it would
%% be nice if he had his own tune, too. It comes to you with faith,
%% hope, and trust, and most sincere best wishes on the arduous
%% years ahead, Mr. President. Good Luck to you!
