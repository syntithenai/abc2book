%% Blanche Bouquet is a simply
%% super Seattle singer (so, by the way, is Dina Black! Yeah!) Blanche
%% sings what I guess would be called music hall songs, with the Volunteer
%% Park Conservatory Orchestra, and it sure is great fun to listen to her
%% "Betty Boop" style in full flight. She has another name she occasionally
%% goes by when she desires privacy, but it's _so_ private even I can't
%% remember it. If you need it, ask John Culhane - he may be able to help.
%% P.S. Blanche actually _lives_ in Olympia - but if she sings in
%% Seattle, doesn't that make her a Seattle singer?
