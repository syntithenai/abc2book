%% Yeah, I know, I wrote
%% Eugenie Brennan a waltz back in Bk.7. But what's it
%% been, over 20 years? So I just felt, she ought to be up-dated,
%% especially since she's John Brennan's sister. That's a pretty good
%% reason, and besides, she sings like a bird. That's another
%% good reason, and besides that, I don't think a hell of a 
%% lot of that other waltz, even if I _did_ write it. So there!
