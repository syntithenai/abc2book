%% Janet May is an old friend
%% and a fine piano player from Youngstown, OH. She recently engineered
%% a trip out there for me to do a piano workshop and dance in Cleveland.
%% I played for a Saturday-night dance with their local band, "Rhubarb
%% Pie", and boy, can they play! What a great night of music it
%% was; I really enjoyed our evening together so much. Thanks
%% loads, Janet; it was a wonderful week-end!
