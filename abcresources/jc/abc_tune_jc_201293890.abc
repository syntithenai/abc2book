W:Chorus.
W:For the sound of his horn brought me from my bed,
W:And the cry of his hounds which he oft-times led;
W:Peel's view halloo would awaken the dead,
W:Or the fox from his lair in the morning.
W:
W:Yes, I ken John Peel and Ruby too!
W:Ranter and Ringwood, Bellman and True,
W:From a find to a check, from a check to a view,
W:From a view to a death in the morning.
W:
W:Then here's to John Peel from my heart and soul,
W:Let's drink to his health, let's finish the bowl,
W:We'll follow John Peel thro' fair and thro' foul,
W:If we want a good hunt in the morning.
W:
W:D'ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
W:He lived at Troutbeck once on a day;
W:Now he has gone far, far, far away;
W:We shall ne'er hear his voice in the morning.
