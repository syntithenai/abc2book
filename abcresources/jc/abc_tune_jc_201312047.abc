W:Our mistress's health we now begin,
W:In spite of the Pope and the Spanish King;
W:For she has got gold and silver in store,
W:And when it is gone she will have some more.
W:So here's to thee, my brother John,
W:'Tis al-ost time that we were gone.
W:We'll smoke, we'll drink, we'll stand our ground,
W:And so let the mis-tress'es health go round.
