%% Long before I had any idea of publishing a work of this character,
%% the fame of John Kelly, and Joseph P. Tamony, as phenomenal
%% fiddlers, had reached Chicago. The measured score of their tunes,
%% for which I am indebted to our mutual friend Francis E. Walsh of
%% San Francisco, is incapable of doing justice to the spirit and
%% excellence of their execution, for all gifted Irish musicians
%% instinctively embellish their performance with peculiar trills, turns
%% and graces, more easily recognized than described.

%%    "The Scholar" was first printed in Levey's Dance Music of
%% Ireland, Vol.1, London 1858; and not since then until the publication
%% of the O'Neill Collections in recent years. The tune seems to have=
%% been a favorite with fiddlers and pipers of Longford, Leitrim and
%% Roscommon, as early as the second quarter of the 19th Century;
%% and, by the way, our talented contributor Mr Kelly hails from the
%% latter county.
