%% 17 year old Isle of Skye fiddler and piper Farquhar MacDonald, then a pupil of Christine Martin, composed
%% this tune as part of an exam for a Higher Music course in Scotland. She suggested he call it something better
%% than his tentative title "The Frozen Haddock". They were at a feis (a traditional music festival for young
%% people) when he named it for that night's session in the Tongadale Hotel, Portree, Isle of Skye, Scotland.
