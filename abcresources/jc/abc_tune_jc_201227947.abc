%% In the town of Deerfield (NH), in a little cabin in the woods
%% surrounded by pretty flowers, there lives a woman named Denna Stiles. We
%% play music together (she's the wonderful flute - fiddle - piccolo player in
%% our band "Old New England"), and she used to have a nice orange kitty
%% named Cecil. She taught him to dance: She would take him by his paws
%% and around the cabin they'd go! Cecil's in Cat Heaven now - I hope this tune
%% brings you happy memories, Deanna, with love frm Bob.
