%% The last time I got down Philly way, I just happened to
%% get there at the same time that Jack Crowley and his
%% lovely wife, Peggy, were throwing a party - They
%% were so nice to me that I thought they needed
%% this jig to thank them for a great evening - see
%% how this sounds on your banjo, Jack - I hope it's OK!
