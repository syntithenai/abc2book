W:As I walked out one morning fair,
W:To view the green fields and take fresh air,
W:I saw young banker standing there,
W:And his true love was a lady fair.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Young banker he had (such) an handsome face,
W:(And) all around his hat he wore a band of lace,
W:Beside such an handsome head of hair,
W:For my young banker I will go there.
W:He said me pretty fair maid will you go on deck,
W:With a chain of gold around your neck,
W:Whatever you do I will prove true,
W:But the answer that she gave, I'll have none of you.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Young banker turned around for to go away,
W:But she called after him for to bid him stay,
W:Oh stay oh stay and I will prove true,
W:But the answer that she gave, I'll have none of you.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:Now she thought that she heard a foreman say,
W:Come pack up your clothes and come away,
W:It pierced her through the very heart,
W:To think that young banker and her should part.
W:
W:Chorus
W:
W:So come all you pretty fair maids your senses of loss,
W:Since the day in love you have been crossed,
W:For you may lament and you may say,
W:Forever rue the day that you said nay.
W:
W:Chorus
