N: Compacted via repeats and multiple endings [JC]
N: The A part has some ties and slurs dropped, to make the 4x repeat possible. See version #1 for the original.
N: Also, the book has the grace notes only the 1st time, but that's for the player to decide.
N: Some ABC software has problems with the 4x repeat. Adding the "A" and "B" labels partly fixed this.
