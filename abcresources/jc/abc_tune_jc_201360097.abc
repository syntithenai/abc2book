W:They rolled him up in a nice clean sheet, and laid him out upon the bed,
W:With a gallon of whisky at his feet, and a barrel of porter at his head.

W:His friends assembled at the wake, and Mrs Finnegan called for lunch.

W:On the first day of May at the close of the day,
W:As I stood in the shade of a green spread-ing tree,
W:A young lov- er a court- ing a Maid- en I spied;
W:I drew ve- ry nigh them to hear and see.
W:
W:The dress that he wore was a velvet so green,
W:All trimmed with gold lace, and as bright as the sea;
W:And he said, "Love, I'll make you my own fairy queen,
W:If you are but willing to go with me."
W:
W:"Lisses and forts shall be at your command,
W:Mountains and valleys the lands and the sea,
W:And the billows that roar along the sea-shore,
W:If you are but willing to go with me."
W:
W:"To make me a queen my birth is too mean,
W:And you will get ladies of higher degree;
W:I know not your name nor from whence you came,
W:So I am not willing to go with thee."
W:
W:"I will tell you my name and I love you the same
W:As if you were a lady of higher degree;
W:John MacAnanty's my name, and from Scrabo I came,
W:And the queen of that country my love shall be."
W:
W:"If I were to go with onw I don't know,
W:My parents and friends would be angry with me;
W:They would bring me back again with shame and disdain,
W:So I am not willing to go with thee."
W:
W:"From your friends we will sail in a ship that won't fail,
W:With silken top-sail and wonderful flight;
W:From this to Coleraine, to France, and to Spain,
W:And home back again in one short night.
W:
W:"There is not a fort from this to the north
W:But we'll dance all around it and sing merrilie;
W:And the lads of Queen Anne shall be at your command,
W:And they shall all stand in great dread of thee.
W:
W:"Many a mile I have roamed in my time,
W:By sea and by land, a-looking for thee;
W:And I never could find peace or rest to my mind,
W:Until fortune proved kind and sent you to me."

W: The Minstrel boy to the war is gone,
W: In the ranks of death you‚Äôll find him;
W: His father‚Äôs sword he hath girded on,
W: And his wild harp slung behind him;
W: "Land of Song!" cried the warrior bard,
W: "Tho‚Äô all the world betrays thee,
W: One sword, at least, thy right shall guard,
W: One faithful harp shall praise thee!"
W:
W: The Minstrel fell! But the foeman‚Äôs chain
W: Could not bring that proud soul under;
W: The harp he lov‚Äôd ne‚Äôer spoke again,
W: For he tore its chords asunder;
W: And said ‚ÄúNo chains shall sully thee,
W: Thou soul of love and brav‚Äôry!
W: Thy songs were made for the pure and free
W: They shall never sound in slavery!
W:
W: The minstrel boy will return one day,
W: When we hear the news, we will cheer it.
W: The minstrel boy will return we pray,
W: Torn in body, perhaps, but not in spirit.
W: Then may he play his harp in peace,
W: In a world such as Heaven intended,
W: For every quarrel of Man must cease,
W: And every battle shall be ended.

W: So it went as it had in the beginning,
W: Eileen Og was big upon the winnin'
W: While big McGrath contentedly was grinnin'
W: At being courted by the pride of Petrovar.
W: Said he, "I know a girl who could knock you into fits."
W: At that lovely Eileen nearly lost her wits.
W: But the upshot of the ruction is that now the robber sits
W: With his arm around the pride of Petrovor.

W: Chorus.
W:
W: So, me boys with fate it's hard to grapple
W: Of me eye, sure Eileen was the apple
W: And now to see her going to the chapel
W: with the hardest featured man in Petrovor.
W: So me boys, here's all I have to say
W: When you do your courtin', make no display
W: And if you want them to run after you,
W: Walk the other way
W:  For they're mostly like the pride of Petrovar

W:  And I said, say's I, to a passer-by                "Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?"

W:  I've travelled a bit, but never was hit    Since my roving career began
W:  But fair and square I surrendered there    To the charms of young Rose McCann.
W:  I'd a heart to let and no tenant yet       Did I meet with in shawl or gown
W:  But in she went and I asked no rent        From the star of the County Down.
W:4.
W:  She'd a soft brown eye and a look so sly,                And a smile like the rose in June.
W:  And you hung on each note from her lily-white throat     As she lilted an Irish tune.
W:  At the pattern dance you were held in a trance           As she tripped through a reel or a jig;
W:  And when her eyes she'd roll, she'd coax, upon my soul,  A spud from a hungry pig.
W:5.
W:  At the Crossroads Fair I'll be surely there           And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes.
W:  With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right    For a smile from my nut brown rose.
W:  No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke                Till my plough turns rust coloured brown,
W:  Till a smiling bride by my own fireside               Sits the star of the County Down.

W: And when Irish eyes are smiling,
W: Sure, they steal your heart away.
W:
W: For your smile is a part Of the love in your heart,
W: And it makes even sunshine more bright.
W: Like the linnet's sweet song, Crooning all the day long,
W: Comes your laughter and light.
W: For the springtime of life Is the sweetest of all
W: There is ne'er a real care or regret;
W: And while springtime is ours Throughout all of youth's hours,
W: Let us smile each chance we get.

W:At the early age of sixteen years he left his native home,
W:And to Australia's sunny land he was inclined to roam.
W:He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he stabbed James MacEvoy.
W:A terror to Australia was the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:One morning on the prairie, wild Jack Duggan rode along
W:While listening to the mockingbird, singing a cheerful song.
W:Out jumped three troopers, fierce and grim; Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy.
W:They'd all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:Surrender now, Jack Duggan, come; you see there's three to one.
W:Surrender in the Queen's name, sir; you are a plundering son.
W:Jack drew two pistols from his side, and glared upon Fitzroy
W:I'll fight but not surrender, cried the Wild Colonial Boy.
W:
W:He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground.
W:He fired point bank at Davis, too, who fell dead at the sound.
W:But a bullet pierced his brave young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy.
W:And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy.

W: 1. If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song
W:      Of a flower that's now droped and dead,
W:      Yet dearer to me, yes than all of its mates,
W:      Though each holds aloft its proud head.
W:      Twas given to me by a girl that I know,
W:      Since we've met, faith I've known no repose.
W:      She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star,
W:      And I call her my wild Irish Rose.
W:
W: Ch.  My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower that grows.
W:      You may search everywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish Rose.
W:      My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that grows,
W:      And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
W:
W: 2. They may sing of their roses, which by other names,
W:      Would smell just as sweetly, they say.
W:      But I know that my Rose would never consent
W:      To have that sweet name taken away.
W:      Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by
W:      The bower where my true love grows,
W:      And my one wish has been that some day I may win
W:      The heart of my wild Irish Rose.
