W:It's on one summer's morning
W:All in the month of May
W:Our ship she lies in harbour
W:For Greenland bore away
W:That the wind blew East a West, my boys,
W:To the Indies I am bound,
W:O'er hills and dales and lofty vales
W:We'll view those fields all round.

W:It was of a blooming sailor-boy
W:All in his blooming years,
W:He comes unto his own true love,
W:His eyes were full of tears.
W:When he comes unto his own true love
W:To let her understand
W:That he was going to leave her,
W:Bound to some foreign land.
W:
W:O Henry, dearest Henry,
W:These words have broke my heart,
W:Let you and I get married, love,
W:And thus before we part.
W:For it's sixteen weeks and better, love,
W:I am with child by three.
W:O stay at home, dear Henry,
W:Prove kind and marry me.
W:
W:If I should stay at home
W:And another man take my place,
W:It would be a dishonour, love,
W:Likewise a sad disgrace.
W:For the King he do want sailor boys
W:And I for one must go,
W:So I am afraid my heart will break,
W:You dares not to say No.
W:
W:Then I will cut off my curly hair,
W:Man's clothing I will put on
W:And I will follow after you
W:To be your waiting-man.
W:Like a true and faithful servant
W:With my Henry I will wed,
W:Where no storms or dangers I don't fear,
W:Let them be ever so great.

W:
W:It's of a summer season,
W:The twenty eighth of May,
W:Come rise you English colours,l ove,
W:And let's be on our way
W:The sun does shine most glorious
W:To Lisbon we are bound
W:Where the hills and hills are covered
W:With the pretty girls all round.
W:
W:It's of a wealthy squire
W:All in his blloming years,
W:He said unto his Nancy
W:With many a melting tear,
W:He said unto his Nancy
W:That she may understand,
W:That he was going to leave her
W:And bound for a foreign land.
W:
W:O do not say so, William,
W:Those words will break my heart.
W:That [Let's?] you and I be married here
W:This night before we part.
W:For there's three long months and better, love,
W:With child I've been by thee.
W:O stay ashore, sweet William,
W:Prove kind and marry me.
W:
W:If I should stay on shore, my love,
W:Another would take my place
W:And wouldn't that be a shocking thing
W:Likewise a sad disgrace.
W:The King hath room (?) for soldiers
W:And I for one must go
W:And for my very life, dear love,
W:I dare not answer No.
W:
W:Then I'll cut off my curly locks,
W:Man's clothing I'll put on
W:And I will sail along with you
W:To be your waiting-man.
W:That true and faithful servant
W:All on you I will wait.
W:I'll fear no storm nor danger
W:Whilst you are by my side.
W:
W:Your waist it is too slender,
W:Your fingers long and small,
W:To wait on me in battle, love,
W:If I on you should call.
W:Where the thundering cannons rattle
W:And bullets swiftly fly,
W:The silver trumpets sounding
W:To drown our dismal cry.
W:
W:If I should met another girl
W:And she should be kind and fair
W:And I should take a liking to her,
W:O Annie what would you say?
W:What would I say, sweet William,
W:O then I'd love her too,
W:I'd quickly step aside, my love,
W:While she was pleasing you.
W:
W:Well done, my dearest Nancy,
W:These words have gained my heart,
W:That you and I be married, love,
W:This night before we part.
W:This couple they got married
W:And they crossed o'er the main.
W:I wish them health and happiness
W:Till they return again.

W:(Version C)
W:
W:'Twas on one Whitsun Wednesday,
W:The fourteenth day of May,
W:We untied our anchor
W:And so we sailed away,
W:When the sun do shine most glorious
W:To Lisbon we are bound,
W:When the hills and hills are dainted
W:With pretty maidens round.
