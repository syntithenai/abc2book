w:When I_ be-*held_ a most love-ly fair.
W:As I was a-walking one midsummer morning,
W:A-viewing the meadows and to take the air,
W:'Twas down by the banks of the sweet primeroses,
W:When I beheld a most lovely Fair.
W:
W:With three long steps I stepp'd up to her,
W:Not knowing her as she pass'd me by;
W:I stepp'd up to her, thinking to view her,
W:She appear'd to me like some virgin bride.
W:
W:I said: Pretty maid, how far are you going?
W:And what's the occasion of all your grief?
W:I'll make you as happy as any lady,
W:If you will grant me one small relief.
W:
W:Stand off, stand off, you are deceitful;
W:You are deceitful, young man, 'tis plain -
W:'Tis you that have caused my poor heart to wander,
W:To give me comfort 'tis all in vain;
W:
W:I'll take thee down to some lonesome valley,
W:Where no man nor mortal shall ever me tell;
W:Where the pretty little small birds do change their voices
W:And every moment their notes do swell.
W:
W:Come all you young men than go a-courting,
W:Pray give attention to what I say,
W:There's many a dark and a cloudy morning
W:Turns out to be a sunshiny day.
