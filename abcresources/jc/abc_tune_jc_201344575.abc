w: Sing-ing Rum-ble-dum-dai-ry, flare up Ma-ry and make her old ta-ble shine.*
W:It's all very well to have a machine
W:To thrash your wheat and barley clean,
W:To thrash it and wim it all fit for sale,
W:Then go off to market so brisk and well,
W:Singing rumble-dum-dairy flare up Mary,
W:And make her old table shine.
W:
W:The man who made her he made her so well,
W:He made every cog and wheel to tell.
W:While the big wheel runs the little one hums,
W:And the feeder sits above the drum,
W:Singing rumble-dum-dairy flare up Mary,
W:And make her old table shine.
W:
W:There's old Father Howard the sheaves to put,
W:While old Mother Howard she does make up.
W:And Mary she sits and feeds all day,
W:While Johnny he carries the straw away,
W:Singing rumble-dum-dairy flare up Mary,
W:And make her old table shine.
W:
W:At seven o'clock we do begin
W:And we generally stop about nine or ten
W:To have our beer and oil her up,
W:Then off we go till one o'clock,
W:Singing rumble-dum-dairy flare up Mary,
W:And make her old table shine.
W:
W:
W:Then after a bite and a drink all round
W:The driver he climbs to his box again
W:And with his long whip he shouts, All right,
W:And he drives 'em round till five at night.
W:Singing rumble-dum-dairy flare up Mary,
W:And make her old table shine.
