%% I am so sorry
%% that only lack of space prevents me from saying more
%% about the great Canote brothrs, wonderful musicians
%% from Seattle, and mainstays of Sandy Medley's
%% Small Wonders String Band. Their playing (and singing!)
%% help set the standard for West Coast music.

%% Note: A fine traditional tune much played at dances is
