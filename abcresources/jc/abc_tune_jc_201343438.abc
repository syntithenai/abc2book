O:Mawgan-in-Pyder, Cornwall, April 1893.
Noted by F. W. Bussell
In the MS., the 10th and 8th notes from the end (D and d) are
Inadvertently written as quarters instead of eighths. This version
commences like "Jog on" (Dancing master,, 1650, p. 53, and later),
which is the Elizabethan "Hanskin" (Fitzwilliam Book, 1899, II, pp. 494ff.).
Also cf. D'Urfey, Pills, 1719, IV, p. 32 ("The Catholick Ballad")
and IV, p. 37 ("Sir Francis Drake; or, Eighty Eight"); and
Chappell, I, pp. 211-13.
