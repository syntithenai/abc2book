N: Tom Anderson's writes:
N: This is the only trowie tune we know of from Unst.  The story goes that a man
N: heard  it  on his way home one evening when he stopped to have a smoke in the
N: shelter of Gullahammer at the south end of Vallafield. The music seemed to be
N: coming  out of the face of the rock and was very eerie.  Belief in those days
N: was that cold steel fended off evil spirits, so he  reached  for  his  pocket
N: knife. As his fingers touched the steel, the music stopped. He still retained
N: the tune in his memory, so when he got home he could  sing  it  over  to  his
N: daughter who played the fiddle.
