%% For Laurie Andres, dear
%% friend and great accordion player from Seattle, WA.
%% He, along with Cathie Whitesides, fiddle, and me on piano,
%% get to play together every so often as the "Rythm Rollers"
%% (don't ask), and it's always great fun. Hope it happens
%% soon, Laurie! (Don't you, Cathie?!)
