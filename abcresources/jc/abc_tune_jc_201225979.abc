%% Marion Stiles is a real nice
%% lady who lives in Concord, NH, and I am greatly in her debt, because
%% what she did was she gave Deanna Stiles to the world, and then Deanna
%% gave Amelia to the world, and where in the world would we be
%% without either one? So thanks loads, Marion, for contributing
%% so much to our happiness. We sure are much obliged to you!
