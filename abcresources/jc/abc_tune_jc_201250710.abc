% Original had bar-repeat signs in second and sixth complete bars of first staff.  They have been replaced by verbatim
% notes ("g2 g g2 g" and "a2 a a2 a") and since ABC notation does not support the bar-repeat sign.
% Original had missing notes (bar too short) in second bar of second staff as follows:
%d3 e2 d|db z ag     |eg z Baf|g3 g2:|B/c/|d2 z d2 z|d3 d^cd|B3 B3|B3 Bcd|e3 e3|e3 gfe|d3 d3|d3 dcB|A3 A3|ABc def|g2 z def|gzd bzd|g3 g2:|
% The notes "B/c/" were inserted at the end of the bar to match similar passages elsewhere in the tune. Result sounds OK.
