T: Simple Twist Of Fate
C:Bob Dylan

M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: They sat together in the park
W: 
W: As the evening sky grew dark
W: 
W: She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
W: 
W: It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
W: 
W: And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: They walked alone by the old canal
W: 
W: A little confused I remember well
W: 
W: And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
W: 
W: He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
W: 
W: Moving with a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: A saxophone someplace far off played
W: 
W: As she was walking on by the arcade
W: 
W: As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up
W: 
W: She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
W: 
W: And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: He woke up the room was bare
W: 
W: He didn't see her anywhere
W: 
W: He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
W: 
W: Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
W: 
W: Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: He hears the ticking of the clocks
W: 
W: And walks along with a parrot that talks
W: 
W: Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in
W: 
W: Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
W: 
W: One more time for a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: People tell me it's a sin
W: 
W: To know and feel too much within
W: 
W: I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
W: 
W: She was born in spring but I was born too late
W: 
W: Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

W: 
W: Ice will melt, water will boil
W: You and I can shake off this mortal coil
W: It's bigger than us
W: You don't have to worry about it
W: 
W: Ready or not here comes the drop
W: You feel lucky when you know where you are
W: You know it's gonna come true
W: Here in your arms I remember
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: 
W: It's easy when you don't try
W: Going on first impressions
W: Man in a cage has made his confession
W: Now you've seen me at my worst
W: And it won't be the last time I'm down there
W: 
W: I want you to know I feel completely at ease
W: Read me like a book that's fallen down between your knees
W: Please, let me have my way with you
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: It's circumstantial, it's nothing written in the sky
W: And we don't even have to try
W: 
W: Shaking like mud, buildings of glass
W: Sink into the bay, they'll be under the rocks again
W: You don't have to say I know you're afraid
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: It's circumstantial, it's something I was born to
W: It's only natural, can I help it if I want to?
W: 
W: Can I help it if I want to?

W: 
W: Well you gassed her up
W: Behind the wheel
W: With your arm around your sweet one
W: In your Oldsmobile
W: Barrelin' down the boulevard
W: You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: And you got paid on Friday
W: And your pockets are jinglin'
W: And you see the lights
W: You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a six
W: And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Then you comb your hair, Shave your face
W: Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
W: All the other days in the week you know
W: that this'll be the Saturday you're reachin' your peak
W: 
W: Stoppin' on the red
W: You're goin' on the green
W: 'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'
W: You've ever seen
W: And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
W: Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Tell me is the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
W: Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
W: Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
W: Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
W: 
W: Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
W: 'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
W: And now you're stumblin'
W: You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Well you gassed her up
W: And you're behind the wheel
W: With your arm around your sweet one
W: In your Oldsmobile
W: Barrellin' down the boulevard
W: You're lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Is this the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
W: Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
W: And the barmaid is smilin' from the corner of her eye
W: Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
W: 
W: Makes it kind of special down in the core
W: And you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
W: It's found you stumblin'
W: Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
W: And you're stumblin'
W: Stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night

T: The Pheasant Plucking Song
B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Me husband is a keeper, he's a very busy man,
W: 
W: I try to understand him and I help him all I can,
W: 
W: But sometimes of an evening I feel a trifle dim,
W: 
W: All alone and plucking pheasants when I'd rather pluck with him.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's mate
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: Cos the pheasant plucker's late.
W: 
W: I'm not good at plucking pheasants, pheasant plucking I get stuck,
W: 
W: Though some peasants find it pleasant I'd much rather pluck a duck,
W: 
W: Oh, but plucking geese is gorgeous, I can pluck a goose with ease
W: 
W: But plucking pheasants is sheer torture, for they haven't any grease.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: He has gone out on the tiles,
W: 
W: He only plucked one pheasant
W: 
W: And I'm sitting here with piles.
W: 
W: You have to pluck them fresh, if they're fresh it's not unpleasant,
W: 
W: I knew a man in Dunstable, could pluck a frozen pheasant.
W: 
W: They say the village constable has pheasant plucking sessions
W: 
W: With the vicar of a Sunday 'twixt the first and second lessons.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's son,
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: Till the pheasant plucker's come.
W: 
W: My good friend Godfrey's most adept, he's really got the knack,
W: 
W: He likes to have a pheasant plucked before he hits the sack.
W: 
W: I try and lend a helping hand, I gather up the feathers,
W: 
W: It's really all this pheasant plucking keeps us here together.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's friend,
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: As a means unto an end.
W: 
W: Me husband's in the woods all day, a-banging with his gun,
W: 
W: If he could hear me heartfelt cries, then surely he would run,
W: 
W: For I've fluff in all me crannies and there's feathers up me nose,
W: 
W: And I'm itchin' in the kitchin' from me head down to me toes.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's wife,
W: 
W: And when we pluck together
W: 
W: It's a pheasant plucking life!

T: Earl Richard
B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: There was a woman in our town and in our town did dwell,
W: She loved her old man dearly but another man twice as well.
W: Chorus (after each verse):
W: And sing fal-the-lal-lal-the-lal-li-day
W: Fal-the-lal lal-li-day
W: She went down to the doctor to see if she could find
W: Anything in the whole world to make her old man blind.
W: "Oh take him sixteen marrowbones and make him eat them all,
W: And when he's finished he'll be so blind, he won't see you at all."
W: So the doctor he wrote a letter and he sealed it with his hand,
W: And he sent it up to the old man to make him understand.
W: But the old man being a crafty bugger he knew it all before,
W: He ate 'em up and he says, "My dear, oh I can't see you at all."
W: Says he, "I'll go to the river and there myself I'll drown."
W: Says she, "I'll walk along with you to see that you don't fall down."
W: They walked along together till they come to the river's brim,
W: So gently there she's kissed him and she crept away behind.
W: She ran and she ran behind him to try to push him in,
W: But the old man heard and he jumped aside and she went tumbling in.
W: So loudly she did holler and loud for mercy call,
W: But the old man says, "I am so blind, I can't see you at all."
W: She swam and she swam and she swam around till she came to the further brim,
W: But the old man got the barge pole and he pushed her further in.
W: "Oh it may take sixteen marrowbones to make your old man blind,
W: But if you want to murder him you must creep up close behind."

W: Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
W: It's crazy I know
W: But my faith says so, it tells me
W: 
W: Am I a fool for hanging on?
W: Would I be a fool to be long gone?
W: When is daylight going to dawn
W: On my crazy faith?
W: 
W: The questions will not let me sleep
W: Answers buried way too deep
W: At the bottom of a lover's leap
W: Made by crazy faith
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: You're not asking if I love this man
W: I know you don't, you don't believe you can

W: It's crazy I know, but my faith says so
W: It tells me
W: 
W: Love your losing, lose your love
W: Let the hawk fly from the glove
W: Then do not search the skies above
W: Search your crazy faith
W: 
W: Love is lightning, love is ice
W: It only strikes the lucky twice
W: Once, so you will know the price
W: And once for crazy faith
W:

W: 
W: Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.
W: Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.
W: Shade is dark.
W: Cool and languid for life or love.
W: Safe in shadows; never stark as the daylight.
W: As the daylight.
W: 
W: When I was just knee high,
W: My Momma told me, never try,
W: To be someone that I am not.
W: Yet over time I had forgot,
W: The wandering child, so lost at play:
W: He's found himself but he can't find his way,
W: In the daylight.
W: Oh, the daylight.
W: 
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Life is short, and there's no turning back the time.
W: Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb in the daylight.
W: In my mind,
W: There's a corner I need to turn.
W: Lessons lived is a lesson learned in the daylight.
W: In the daylight.
W: 
W: I miss the forest shade,
W: You took me there, the promise I made,
W: To never leave the dark so deep.
W: Safe and soothing, yet I fear,
W: As I recall and now reflect,
W: I see it's safer to connect,
W: To the daylight.
W: Oh, the daylight. (Light.)
W: 
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: 
W: Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.
W: Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.
W: Of the day...

W: 
W: The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying

W: 
W: Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
W: 
W: And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
W: 
W: And I am dead, as dead I well may be
W: 
W: You'll come and find the place where I am lying
W: 
W: And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.
W: 
W: And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
W: 
W: And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be

W: 
W: I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.

W: 
W: With vassals and serfs by my side
W: 
W: And of all who assembled within those walls
W: 
W: That I was the hope and the pride
W: 
W: I had riches all too great to count
W: 
W: And high ancestral name…..but
W: 
W: I also dreamt which pleased me most
W: 
W: That you loved me still the same
W: 
W: That you loved me…. You loved still the same
W: 
W: That you loved me…. You loved still the same
W: 
W: That you loved me…. You loved still the same
W: 
W: I dreamt that suitors sought my hand
W: 
W: That knights upon bended knee
W: 
W: And with vows no maiden’s heart could withstand
W: 
W: They pledged their faith to me
W: 
W: And I dreamt that one of the noble host
W: 
W: Came forth my hand to claim….but
W: 
W: I also dreamt which charmed me most
W: 
W: That you loved me still the same
W: 
W: That you loved me…. You loved still the same
W: 
W: That you loved me…. You loved still the same
W:

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Long, long ago, where the tall grass grows
W: 
W: and the still air is sweet with summer flowers;
W: 
W: in the shade by the stream I would lie awake and dream,
W: 
W: and in dreaming I would while away the hours.
W: 
W: Long, long gone yesterday,
W: 
W: and the castle and the prince and the God to whom I prayed.
W: 
W: Well, I made, and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses.
W: 
W: I'm tired of trying to be free.
W: 
W: Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W: 
W: Well, I wasted years,
W: 
W: all the useless, bitter tears.
W: 
W: If I'd known I'd have stopped it at the start.
W: 
W: I knew life was long,
W: 
W: and I knew life could go wrong,
W: 
W: but I never knew my life would break my heart.
W: 
W: Dreams die harder than pride.
W: 
W: I have learned my lesson well.
W: 
W: I will put them both aside.
W: 
W: 'Cause I made and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses.
W: 
W: I'm tired and I'm dying to be free.
W: 
W: Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W: 
W: Roses die, and all the fairy tales are lies,
W: 
W: and I guess that's just too bad for poor old me.
W: 
W: 'Cause I made, and I'm gonna lie in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W:

W: 
W: With a gentle kind of motion
W: 
W: As it moves across the land
W:

C:Billy Joel
B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: In every heart there is a room
W: 
W: A sanctuary safe and strong
W: 
W: To heal the wounds from lovers past
W: 
W: Until a new one comes along
W: 
W: I spoke to you in cautious tones
W: 
W: You answered me with no pretence
W: 
W: And still I feel I said too much
W: 
W: My silence is my self defense
W: 
W: And every time I’ve held a rose
W: 
W: It seems I only felt the thorns
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And so will you soon I suppose
W: 
W: But if my silence made you leave
W: 
W: Then that would be my worst mistake
W: 
W: So I will share this room with you
W: 
W: And you can have this heart to break
W: 
W: And this is why my eyes are closed
W: 
W: It’s just as well for all I’ve seen
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And you’re the only one who knows
W: 
W: So I would choose to be with you
W: 
W: That’s if the choice were mine to make
W: 
W: But you can make decisions too
W: 
W: And you can have this heart to break
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And you’re the only one who knows

W: They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
W: Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
W: Possessing and caressing me
W: 
W: Jai guru deva, om
W: Nothing's gonna change my world x 4
W: 
W: Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
W: They call me on and on across the universe
W: Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
W: They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
W: 
W: Jai guru deva, om
W: Nothing's gonna change my world x 4

W: Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears Inciting and inviting me
W: Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Here is a story about a sinner,
W: He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
W: But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
W: And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
W: It turned him to the booze,
W: And he got mixed up with a floosie
W: And she led him to a life of indecision.
W: The floosie made him spend his dole
W: She left him lying on Skid Row
W: A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
W: It's such a shame.
W: 
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Sad memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would say,
W: Damn it all and blow it all,
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
W: 
W: Barley wine pink gin,
W: He'll drink anything,
W: Port, Pernod or tequila,
W: Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
W: As long as all his troubles disappeared.
W: But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife,
W: And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
W: She's gonna turn him on to drink
W: She's gonna lead him to the brink
W: And when his money's gone,
W: She'll leave him in the gutter,
W: 
W: It's such a shame.
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Sad memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would fall,
W: A slave to demon alcohol.

W: 
W: It’s not often that time turns itself around
W: 
W: And you watch your shadow pass you by
W: 
W: Every minute, every move, every single sound
W: 
W: Takes on meaning to your eye
W: 
W: In the summer breeze of cool and sandy beach towns
W: 
W: I stood alone again and cried
W: 
W: Days rolled by, and they were warm and hot and round
W: 
W: I looked for answers in the sky
W: 
W: Now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine
W: 
W: Don’t you tend to wander in some distant daze
W: 
W: When all you’ve worked for tumbles down
W: 
W: You’re and actor in some far away movie haze
W: 
W: You clutch your heart as you hit the ground
W: 
W: But now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine
W: 
W: Hearts are worth the mending, though they heal up slowly
W: 
W: Every beat hits soft and low
W: 
W: Comes a time when all the pain and hurt is ending
W: 
W: And your heart gets up to go
W: 
W: In the autumn, it was winter’s watch I was keeping
W: 
W: And the world was brown and gold
W: 
W: You crept on in and kissed me while I lay there sleeping
W: 
W: And handed me a lover’s rose
W: 
W: Now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine

W: And I ain’t seen the sunshine since I don’t know when
W: 
W: I’m stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
W: 
W: But that train keeps on rolling, down to San Antone
W: 
W: When I was just a baby, my mama told me Son
W: 
W: Always be a good boy, don’t ever play with guns
W: 
W: But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
W: 
W: When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
W: 
W: I bet there’s rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
W: 
W: They’re prob’ly drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
W: 
W: But I know I had it coming, I know I can’t be free
W: 
W: But those people keep a-moving, and that’s what tortures me
W: 
W: Will if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
W: 
W: I bet I’d move over a little further down the line
W: 
W: Far from Folsom Prison, that’s where I want to stay
W: 
W: And I’d let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

V:1 
W: 
W: All that I have is a river                       C   -  G  - F  -  Am  - E. - Dm
W: The river is always my home
W: Lord, take me away
W: For I just cannot stay
W: Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: The water sustains me without even trying
W: The water can't drown me, I'm done
W: With my dying
W: 
W: Please help me build a small boat
W: One that'll ride on the flow
W: Where the river runs deep
W: And the larger fish creep
W: I'm glad of what keeps me afloat
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Now deeper the water I sail
W: And faster the current I'm in
W: That each night brings the stars
W: And the song in my heart
W: Is a tune for the journeyman's tale
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Now the land that I knew is a dream
W: And the line on the distance grows faint
W: So wide is my river
W: The horizon a sliver
W: The artist has run out of paint
W: 
W: Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
W: And the big yellow sun leads me home
W: I'm everywhere now
W: The way is a vow
W: To the wind of each breath by and by

W: 
W: Come over here, babe
W: It ain't that bad
W: I don't claim to understand
W: The troubles that you've had
W: But the dogs you say they fed you to
W: Lay their muzzles in your lap
W: And the lions that they led you to
W: Lie down and take a nap
W: The ones you fear are wind and air
W: And I love you without measure
W: It seems we can be happy now
W: Be it better late than never
W:

W: 
W: The burdens that you carry now
W: Are not of your creation
W: So let's not weep for their evil deeds
W: But for their lack of imagination
W: Today's the time for courage, babe
W: Tomorrow can be for forgiving
W: And if he touches you again with his stupid hands
W: His life won't be worth living
W: 
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come to me
W: 
W: Walk with me now under the stars
W: For it's a clear and easy pleasure
W: And be happy in my company
W: For I love you without measure
W: Walk with me now under the stars
W: It's a safe and easy pleasure
W: It seems we can be happy now
W: It's late but it ain't never
W: It's late but it ain't never
W: It's late but it ain't never Come over here, babe

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Looking out on the morning rain
W: 
W: I used to feel uninspired
W: 
W: And when I knew I had to face another day
W: 
W: Lord, it made me feel so tired
W: 
W: Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
W: 
W: But your love was the key to peace my mind
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
W: 
W: A natural woman
W: 
W: When my soul was in the lost-and-found
W: 
W: You came along to claim it
W: 
W: I didn't know just what was wrong with me
W: 
W: Till your kiss helped me name it
W: 
W: Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
W: 
W: Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
W: 
W: A natural woman
W: 
W: Oh, baby, what you've done to me
W: 
W: You make me feel so good inside
W: 
W: And I just want to be close to you
W: 
W: You make me fell so alive
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like

C:Joan Baez
B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: How long since I've spent a whole night in a twin bed with a stranger
W: 
W: his warm arms all around me
W: 
W: How long since I've gazed into dark eyes that melted my soul down
W: 
W: to a place where it longed to be?
W: 
W: All of your history has little to do with your face;
W: 
W: You're mainly a mystery with violins filling in space.
W: 
W: You stood in the nude by the mirror and picked out a rose
W: 
W: from the bouquet in our hotel
W: 
W: And laid down beside me again, and I watched the rose
W: 
W: on the pillow as it fell.
W: 
W: I sank and I slept in a twilight with only one care -
W: 
W: To know that when day broke and I woke that you'd still be there.
W: 
W: The hours, for once, they passed slowly, unendingly by
W: 
W: Like a sweet breeze on a field;
W: 
W: Your gentleness came down upon me and I guess I thanked you
W: 
W: when you caused me to yield
W: 
W: We spoke not a sentence and took not a footstep beyond
W: 
W: our two days together which seemingly soon would be gone.
W: 
W: Don't tell me of love everlasting -  and other sad dreams -
W: 
W: I don't want to hear.
W: 
W: Just tell me of passionate strangers who rescue each other
W: 
W: from a lifetime of cares.
W: 
W: And if love means forever, expecting nothing returned,
W: 
W: Then I hope I'll be given another whole lifetime to learn.
W: 
W: 'cause I took from you oh so many things, it makes me wonder
W: 
W: how they could belong to me,
W: 
W: And I gave you only my dark eyes which melted your soul down
W: 
W: to a place where it longed to be -

W: Joan Baez Prison Trilogy Lyrics                (Words and Music by Joan
W: Baez)
W: 
W: Billy Rose was a low rider, Billy Rose was a night fighter
W: 
W: Billy Rose knew trouble like the sound of his own name
W: 
W: Busted on a drunken charge
W: 
W: Driving someone else's car
W: 
W: The local midnight sheriff's claim to fame
W: 
W: In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
W: 
W: Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded
W: 
W: Knowing they'd remain the boss
W: 
W: Knowing he would pay the cost
W: 
W: They saw he was severely reprimanded
W: 
W: In the blackest cell on "A" Block
W: 
W: He hanged himself at dawn
W: 
W: With a note stuck to the bunk head
W: 
W: Don't mess with me, just take me home
W: 
W: Come and lay, help us lay young Billy down
W: 
W: Luna was a Mexican the law called an alien
W: 
W: For coming across the border with a baby and a wife
W: 
W: Though the clothes upon his back were wet
W: 
W: Still he thought that he could get
W: 
W: Some money and things to start a life
W: 
W: It hadn't been too very long when it seemed like everything went wrong
W: 
W: They didn't even have the time to find themselves a home
W: 
W: This foreigner, a brown-skin male
W: 
W: Thrown into a Texas jail
W: 
W: It left the wife and baby quite alone
W: 
W: He eased the pain inside him
W: 
W: With a needle in his arm
W: 
W: But the dope just crucified him
W: 
W: He died to no one's great alarm
W: 
W: Come and lay, help us lay Young Luna down
W: 
W: And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons To the ground
W: 
W: Kilowatt was an aging con of 65 who stood a chance to stay alive
W: 
W: And leave the joint and walk the streets again
W: 
W: As the time he was to leave drew near
W: 
W: He suffered all the joy and fear
W: 
W: Of leaving 35 years in the pen
W: 
W: And on the day of his release he was approached by the police
W: 
W: Who took him to the warden walking slowly by his side
W: 
W: The warden said "You won't remain here
W: 
W: But it seems a state retainer
W: 
W: Claims another 10 years of your life."
W: 
W: He stepped out in the Texas sunlight
W: 
W: The cops all stood around
W: 
W: Old Kilowatt ran 50 yards
W: 
W: Then threw himself down on the ground
W: 
W: They might as well just have laid The old man down
W: 
W: And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons To the ground
W: 
W: Help us raze, raze the prisons To the ground

W: Like you never done before
W: And it ain't no use in calling out my name
W: I can't hear you anymore
W: I'm a-thinking and a-wondering walking down the road
W: I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
W: I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
W: But don't think twice, it's all right
W: 
W: So long honey, babe
W: Where I'm bound, I can't tell
W: Goodbye's too good a word, babe
W: So I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
W: I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
W: You could've done better but I don't mind
W: You just kinda wasted my precious time
W: But don't think twice, it's all right

W: 
W: Jeg elsker at sidde alene
W: 
W: og drømme og fantasere.
W: 
W: Men har jeg været længe nok alene,
W: 
W: vil jeg ikke vær´ alene mere.
W: 
W: Så er det godt at ha´ en rigtig ven
W: 
W: og ha´ nogen at snakke med igen.
W: 
W: En man kan dele sine drømme med
W: 
W: lege eller danse eller svømme med.
W: 
W: Det er rart at være alene - men
W: 
W: det er bedst at ha´ en ven.
W: 
W: Det er dejligt at vandre alene
W: 
W: og kigge på blomster og bier
W: 
W: og på fugle der sidder på grene
W: 
W: men så´ der noget i mig der siger.
W: 
W: Nu er det godt, at ha´ en rigtig ven.
W: 
W: og ha´ nogen at snakke med igen.
W: 
W: Enten en med bukser eller kjole på
W: 
W: bare det er én, man kan stole på.
W: 
W: Det er rart at være alene - men
W: 
W: det er bedst at ha´ en ven.
W: 
W: Jeg tænker tit hemmelige tanker
W: 
W: som andre slet ikke aner
W: 
W: og kun en ven skal man så fortælle
W: 
W: om sine hemmelige planer.
W: 
W: Så er det godt at ha´ en rigtig ven
W: 
W: og ha´ nogen at betro sig til igen.
W: 
W: Du kan være tynd eller tem´lig fed,
W: 
W: bare du kan holde på en hem´lighed.
W: 
W: Det er rart at være alene - men
W: 
W: det er bedst at ha´ en ven.
W: 
W: Jeg elsker at lege alene
W: 
W: og egne og medellere
W: 
W: men har jeg leget længe nok alene,
W: 
W: så vil jeg ikke lege alene mere
W: 
W: Så er det godt, at ha´ en rigtig ven,
W: 
W: og ha´ nogen at lege med igen.
W: 
W: En man kan hoppe eller gynge med
W: 
W: en man kan grine eller synge med
W: 
W: Det er rart at være alene - men
W: 
W: det er bedst at ha´ en ven.

W: 
W: The tears of a woman are hidden within
W: As she moves from one to the next, her spirit grows thin
W: And when she falls in love with one, it's hard but it's true
W: But it's oh so much harder when that man is you
W: 
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown
W: 
W: One stormy day I was out at sea
W: The waves they rolled and tumbled over me
W: I spied dry land and a tall pale tree
W: I knew that soon that's where I'd like to be
W: 
W: My sweetheart left me for another one
W: And now I wait for the next rising sun
W: 
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't go down
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found

W:

W: 'Cause this fine old world
W: It keeps spinning around
W: 
W: I've been a puppet, a pauper,
W: A pirate, a poet,
W: A pawn and a king,
W: I've been up and down and over and out
W: And I know one thing
W: Each time I find myself
W: Flat on my face
W: I pick myself up and get back in the race
W: 
W: That's life
W: I tell you, I can't deny it
W: I thought of quitting baby
W: But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
W: And if I didn't think it was worth one single try

W: That's life, and I can't deny it
W: Many times I thought of cutting out
W: But my heart won't buy it
W: But if there nothing shaking coming this here July
W: I'm going to roll myself up in a big ball
W: And die...

V:1 
W: He came back from the city
W: I say "cus' where ya bin?"
W: He says "Brother I been livin' on the wire
W: Lived down in that gutter where the fittest survive
W: I ploughed through them fields of fire
W: Had a needle in a vein, that profited the sane
W: Had a friend with no name who was a liar
W: Saw the white walls of freedom, never found the black door
W: Saw the Devil sing with the Angels in a choir....Sisters....
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: We'll take you home to the land we know
W: Give you that peace of the evening
W: Give you that moon with the wind on your face
W: The rains and the change of each season
W: 
W: I saw people who were trapped
W: Under the whip of fat cats
W: Saw people there devoid of their Dreaming
W: Deep down inside there with so much to hide
W: Brother you could see in their eyes there's no meaning
W: So take me my sisters and welcome me home
W: So I never again walk alone
W: Our spirit demands that we die in this land
W: And I know now my spirit's come home
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: I says, `Brother what you see in this land of "Progress"?'
W: He says, `I never felt them four winds a blowin'
W: Lived with people in chains, the wounded and lame
W: Heard Messiahs who spoke without knowin'
W: And them seven seas rose and the desert lands froze
W: Each individual there was trapped in a prison
W: And my spirit cried out, to know what it's about, brother
W: Their basis had no rhyme or no reason

W: She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
W: I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
W: Who will dance on the floor in the round
W: She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
W: 
W: She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
W: Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
W: Who will dance on the floor in the round
W: 
W: People always told me be careful of what you do
W: And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
W: And mother always told me be careful of who you love
W: And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son
W: She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
W: 
W: For forty days and forty nights
W: The law was on her side
W: But who can stand when she's in demand
W: Her schemes and plans
W: 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
W: So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
W: (Don't think twice, don't think twice)
W: 
W: She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
W: Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
W: 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
W: 
W: People always told me be careful of what you do
W: And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
W: She came and stood right by me
W: Just the smell of sweet perfume
W: This happened much too soon
W: She called me to her room
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover

W: 
W: You just closed the door behind you
W: 
W: Leaving me in dark despair
W: 
W: Standing all alone, I’m feeling like a fool
W: 
W: I only tried to make you understand
W: 
W: You have tried your best to love me
W: 
W: Always tried to give yourself
W: 
W: But you hide your heart and now that I can see
W: 
W: That nothing will be the way it was before
W: 
W: It ain’t the way you treat me
W: 
W: It’s just the way you tell a lie
W: 
W: It ain’t the way you leave me
W: 
W: It’s jut the way you say goodbye
W: 
W: Yesterday you could have told me
W: 
W: When you looked into my eyes
W: 
W: Standing face to face I hoped to see a sigh
W: 
W: That the words you said was just another lie

W: The way we walk, the way we talk
W: The way we stalk, the way we kiss
W: We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
W: Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
W: We bite and scratch and scream all night
W: Let's go and throw all the songs we know...
W: 
W: Into the sea, you and me
W: All these years and no one heard
W: I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing

W: "We missed you", hissed the lovecats    (Ba da dab dab da da da da da da........)
W: 
W: We're so wonderfully, wonderfully, wonderfully, wonderfully pretty!
W: Oh you know that I'd do anything for you...
W: We should have each other to tea huh?
W: We should have each other with cream
W: Then curl up by the fire and sleep for a while
W: It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream
W: 
W: Into the sea, you and me
W: All these years and no one heard
W: I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing

W: And always the right way round
W: Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces...
W: How could we miss someone as dumb as this.......................?
W: "We missed you", hissed the lovecats    (Ba da dab dab da da da da da da........)
W: "We missed you", hissed the lovecats    (Ba da dab dab da da da da da da........)

V:1 
W: 
W: We don't all die young to save our spark
W: From the ravages of time
W: But the first and last to leave their mark
W: Someday become the traveling kind
W: 
W: In the wind are names of poets past
W: Some were friends of yours and mine
W: And to those unsung, we lift our glass
W: May their songs become the traveling kind
W: 
W: We were born to brave this tilted world
W: With our hearts laid on the line
W: Be it way-crossed boy or red dirt girl
W: The song becomes the traveling kind
W: 
W: There are mountains worth their weight in gold
W: Mere mortals dare not climb
W: Come ye tipsy, sainted, sinners both
W: And claim them for the traveling kind
W: 
W: When the music slowly starts to fade
W: Into the light's last soft decline
W: Let us lie down in that evening shade
W: And rest among the traveling kind
W: And the song goes on for the traveling kind

W: 
W: / " / " / B7 - Em Am / B7 - Em - /
W: 
W: At your command before you here I stand
W: 
W: My heart is in my hand - yecch
W: 
W: It's here that I must be
W: 
W: My heart entreats, just hear those savage beats
W: 
W: And go put on your cleats and come and trample me
W: 
W: / Am D7 G / Em Am / Ebdim7 E E7 / Am D7 G / Em Am D7 G B7 /
W: 
W: Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
W: 
W: That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
W: 
W: My soul is on fire, it's aflame with desire
W: 
W: Which is why I perspire when we tango
W: 
W: You caught my nose
W: 
W: In your left castanet, love
W: 
W: I can feel the pain yet, love
W: 
W: Ev'ry time I hear drums
W: 
W: And I envy the rose
W: 
W: That you held in your teeth, love
W: 
W: With the thorns underneath, love
W: 
W: Sticking into your gums
W: 
W: / C C7 / F - / B7 - / Em - / 1st, 2nd, 3rd / B7 - /
W: 
W: Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
W: 
W: The last time I needed twenty stitches
W: 
W: To sew up the gash that you made with your lash
W: 
W: As we danced to the masochism tango
W: 
W: Bash in my brain and make me scream with pain
W: 
W: Then kick me once again and say we'll never part
W: 
W: I know too well I'm underneath your spell
W: 
W: So, Darling, if you smell something burning, it's my heart
W: 
W: Hic! Excuse me
W: 
W: Take your cigarette from its holder
W: 
W: And burn your initials in my shoulder
W: 
W: Fracture my spine and swear that you're mine
W: 
W: As we dance to the maso-chism tango

W: The words I have to say
W: May well be simple but they're true
W: Until you give your love
W: There's nothing more that we can do
W: 
W: Love is the opening door
W: Love is what we came here for
W: No one could offer you more
W: Do you know what I mean
W: Have your eyes really seen
W: 
W: You say it's very hard
W: To leave behind the life we knew
W: But there's no other way
W: And now it's really up to you
W: 
W: Love is the key we must turn
W: Truth is the flame we must burn
W: Freedom the lesson we must learn
W: Do you know what I mean
W: Have your eyes really seen
W: 
W: Love is the opening door
W: Love is what we came here for
W: No one could offer you more

B: charlotte songs

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: If I ever feel the light again
W: 
W: Shining down on me
W: 
W: I don’t have to tell you
W: 
W: How welcome it would be
W: 
W: I felt the light before
W: 
W: But I let it slip away
W: 
W: And I just keep on believing
W: 
W: That it’ll come back some day
W: 
W: It’s not the spotlight
W: 
W: It’s not the candlelight
W: 
W: It’s not the streetlight
W: 
W: Of some old street of dreams
W: 
W: It ain’t the moonlight
W: 
W: Not even the sunlight
W: 
W: But I’ve seen it shining in your eyes
W: 
W: and you know what I mean
W: 
W: Sometimes I try to tell myself
W: 
W: that the light was never real
W: 
W: just a fantasy that used to be
W: 
W: the way I used to feel
W: 
W: but you and I know better
W: 
W: even though it’s been so long
W: 
W: now if your memory really serves you well
W: 
W: you’ll never tell me no wrong
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Repeat: If I ever see the light again……

B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: It's up in the morning and on the downs
W: Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
W: And I am breathless over you
W: 
W: And the red-breasted robin beats his wings
W: His throat it trembles when he sings
W: For he is helpless before you
W: 
W: The happy hooded bluebells bow
W: And bend their heads all a-down
W: Heavied by the early morning dew
W: 
W: At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
W: The fishes leap up to take a look
W: For they are breathless over you
W: 
W: Still your hands
W: And still your heart
W: For still your face comes shining through
W: And all the morning glows anew
W: 
W: Still your mind
W: Still your soul
W: For still, the fare of love is true
W: And I am breathless without you
W: 
W: The wind circles among the trees
W: And it bangs about the new-made leaves
W: For it is breathless without you
W: 
W: The fox chases the rabbit round
W: The rabbit hides beneath the ground
W: For he is defenceless without you
W: 
W: The sky of daytime dies away
W: And all the earthly things they stop to play
W: For we are all breathless without you
W: 
W: I listen to my juddering bones
W: The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
W: And I am breathless without you
W: 
W: Still your hands
W: And still your heart
W: For still your face comes shining through
W: And all the morning glows anew
W: 
W: Still your soul
W: Still your mind
W: Still, the fire of love is true
W: And I am breathless without you

W: Come wander quietly  / and listen to the wind

W: Come walking high above /  the rolling of the sea
W: And watch /  the swallow as he flies
W: 
W: There is no sorrow like  / the murmur of his wings
W: There is no / choir like his song
W: There is no power like  / the freedom of his flight
W: And the swallow /  he roams alone

W: Do you hear the calling of twenty thousand souls
W: Do you feel the trembling in  / the storm
W: Do you see the suffering  / so worthy of his name
W: Will you hear the swallow when he's flown?
W: 
W: And will your yearning take / you to  / the swallows home
W: And will your loving ease your pain
W: And will his music drive  / confusion from your soul
W: And will you hear a love song in his name
W: 
W: Come wander quietly  / and listen to the wind
W: Come near and listen to / the sky
W: Come walking high above /  the rolling of the sea
W: And watch /  the swallow as he flies

W: Isn’t spring your favorite season
W: 
W: Watching the flowers bloomin’ up out of the ground
W: 
W: Watching the snow melt down boy
W: 
W: You may dig winter time but spring is my joy
W: 
W: It’s got me feeling so sad the days are breezy
W: 
W: You’ve got the time to say hello and give a smile
W: 
W: Feeling real good is in style
W: 
W: You may dig winter boy but spring is my joy
W: 
W: It’s something special havn’t you observed
W: 
W: It makes you glad to be alive
W: 
W: It’s not absurd
W: 
W: to say that spring helps you survive
W: 
W: The winter’s long miserable cold and rain
W: 
W: it gives you hope to know that spring will get a refrain
W: 
W: You only have to believe the day is coming
W: 
W: The world is humming thinkin’ about how good it’ll be
W: 
W: And that goes double for me
W: 
W: You may dig winter boy but….

W: Triple for me

W: You may dig winter boy but….

W: And everywhere was the song
W: 
W: And the celebration
W: 
W: And she dreamed she saw the bomber jet planes
W: 
W: Riding shotgun in the sky
W: 
W: And they were turning into butterflies
W: 
W: Above our nation ...
W: 
W: She was stardust
W:

V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: I was born on the path of the winter wind
W: 
W: Raised where the mountains are old
W: 
W: The springtime waters came dancing down,
W: 
W: I remember the tales they told.
W: 
W: Well the whistling ways of my younger days
W: 
W: too quickly have faded on by,
W: 
W: And all of my memories linger on
W: 
W: Like the light in the fading sky.
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: River take me along in your sunshine sing me a song,
W: 
W: Ever moving, and winding and free,
W: 
W: You rolling old river, you changing old river,
W: 
W: Let's you and me river, run down to the sea.
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Well I've been to the city and I've been back again,
W: 
W: I've been moved by some things that I've learned,
W: 
W: Met a lot of good people and I called them friends,
W: 
W: Felt the change when the seasons turned.
W: 
W: I've heard all of the songs that the children sing
W: 
W: And listened to love's melodies,
W: 
W: Felt my own music within me rise,
W: 
W: Like the wind in the Autumn breeze..
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Well some day when the flowers are blooming still,
W: 
W: Some day when the grass is still green,
W: 
W: The rolling waters will round me bend and flow into the open sea.
W: 
W: So here's to the rainbow that's followed me here
W: 
W: And here's to the friends that I know,
W: 
W: And here's to the song that's within me now,
W: 
W: I will sing it where e're I go.
W:

W: From a church on a breeze
W: To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
W: Stones on its way
W: To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray
W: 
W: I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
W: I know I will hear what I've heard before
W: My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
W: And I'll sing once more

V:1 
W: 
W: If life is a river and your heart is a boat
W: And just like a water baby, baby born to float
W: And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
W: And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
W: 'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
W: Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
W: And we stack all the dead men in self-addressed crates
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day
W: When fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
W: And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
W: Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
W: Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: And heaven has its way
W: When all will harmonise
W: And know it's in our hearts
W: The dream will realise
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes

W: I met two angels but they were in disguise
W: Took one look to realize
W: Tell them anything and they will sympathize
W: These arms hold me tight
W: 
W: Old fears, helped to ease them in my mind
W: New tears say that they will dry in time
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: Hallelujah
W: 
W: Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
W: Been that way since '95
W: Give me direction when it is hard to fight
W: Three roads, one light
W: 
W: Now and then I can lean my back to yours
W: Traveling like our feet don't touch the floor
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: I had a best friend but she has come to pass
W: One I wish I could see now
W: You always remind me that memories will last
W: These arms reach out
W: 
W: You were there to protect me like a shield
W: Long hair running with me through the field
W: Everywhere you've been with me all along
W: 
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Hallelujah

W: 
W: Until you’ve loved a love you’ve had to lose
W: 
W: You don’t know what love is
W:

W:

W: 
W: You don’t know what love is
W: 
W: Do you know how a lost heart fears
W: 
W: The thought of reminiscing
W: 
W: And how lips that taste of tears
W: 
W: Lose their taste for kissing
W: 
W: You don’t know how hearts burn
W: 
W: For love that cannot live yet never dies
W: 
W: Until you’ve faced each dawn with sleepless nights

W: 
W: It's a god-awful small affair
W: 
W: To the girl with the mousy hair
W: 
W: But her mummy is yelling "No"
W: 
W: And her daddy has told her to go
W: 
W: But her friend is nowhere to be seen
W: 
W: Now she walks through her sunken dream
W: 
W: To the seat with the clearest view
W: 
W: And she's hooked to the silver screen
W: 
W: But the film is a saddening bore
W: 
W: For she's lived it ten times or more
W: 
W: She could spit in the eyes of fools
W: 
W: As they ask her to focus on
W: 
W: Sailors fighting in the dance hall
W: 
W: Oh man! Look at those cavemen go

W: 
W: Rule Britannia is out of bounds

W: To my mother, my dog, and clowns

C:Nanci Griffith
B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Baby I know that we've got trouble in the fields
W: When the bankers swarm like locust out there turning away our yield
W: The trains roll by our silos, silver in the rain
W: They leave our pockets full of nothing, but our dreams and the golden grain
W: 
W: Have you seen the folks in line downtown at the station
W: They're all buying their ticket out and talking the great depression
W: Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
W: When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: And all this trouble in our fields
W: If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
W: They'll never take our native soil
W: 
W: But if we sell that new John Deere
W: And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears
W: You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
W: Come harvest time we'll work it out
W: There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields
W: 
W: There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
W: And there's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos on every page
W: Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
W: They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Repeat
W: You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
W: Come harvest time we'll work it out
W: There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields

W: Sing low, Sing clear,  Sweet words in my ear
W: 
W: Not a whisper of despair, But love's own prayer
W: 
W: Sing on, until, You bring back the thrill
W: 
W: Of a sentimental tune, That died too soon
W: 
W: Our harmony was lost
W: 
W: But you forgave, I forgot
W: 
W: Whisper not of quarrels past
W: 
W: You know we've had our last
W: 
W: So now, we'll be,  On key constantly
W: 
W: Love will whisper on eternally
W: 
W: Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
W: 
W: Gossiping voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up
W: 
W: If we forget 'em all, and answer Cupid's call
W: 
W: It's the truth!
W: 
W: Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
W: 
W: All it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not of rumours
W: 
W: But of your love for me, That's how it's got to be

W: 
W: I was an unmarried girl
W: 
W: I'd just turned twenty-seven
W: 
W: When they sent me to the sisters
W: 
W: For the way men looked at me
W: 
W: Branded as a jezebel
W: 
W: I knew I was not bound for Heaven
W: 
W: I'd be cast in shame
W: 
W: Into the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Most girls come here pregnant
W: 
W: Some by their own fathers
W: 
W: Bridget got that belly
W: 
W: By her parish priest
W: 
W: We're trying to get things white as snow
W: 
W: All of us woe-begotten-daughters
W: 
W: In the steaming stains
W: 
W: Of the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Prostitutes and destitutes
W: 
W: And temptresses like me--
W: 
W: Fallen women--
W: 
W: Sentenced into dreamless drudgery ...
W: 
W: Why do they call this heartless place
W: 
W: Our Lady of Charity?
W: 
W: Oh charity!
W: 
W: These bloodless brides of Jesus
W: 
W: If they had just once glimpsed their groom
W: 
W: Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
W: 
W: Concealed behind their rosaries
W: 
W: They wilt the grass they walk upon
W: 
W: They leech the light out of a room
W: 
W: They'd like to drive us down the drain
W: 
W: At the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Peg O'Connell died today
W: 
W: She was a cheeky girl
W: 
W: A flirt
W: 
W: They just stuffed her in a hole!
W: 
W: Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
W: 
W: One day I'm going to die here too
W: 
W: And they'll plant me in the dirt
W: 
W: Like some lame bulb
W: 
W: That never blooms come any spring
W: 
W: Not any spring
W: 
W: No, not any spring
W: 
W: Not any spring

W: Make me a poster of an old rodeo
W: Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
W: To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
W: 
W: When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
W: He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
W: But that was a long time and no matter how I try
W: The years just flow by like a broken-down dam
W: 
W: Chorus
W:

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: She went over to his apartment clutching her decision
W: and he said, did you come here to tell me goodbye?
W: so she built a skyscraper of procrastination
W: and then she leaned out the twenty-fifth floor window of her reply
W: and she felt like an actress just reading her lines
W: when she finally said yes. it's really goodbye this time
W: and far below was the blacktop and the tiny toy cars
W: and it all fell so fast and it all fell so far
W: and she said:
W: 
W: you are a miracle but that is not all
W: you are also a stiff drink and i am on call
W: you are a party and i am a school night
W: and i'm lookin' for my door key, but you are my porch light
W: and you'll never know, dear just how much i loved you
W: you'll probably think this was just my big excuse
W: but i stand committed to a love that came before you
W: and the fact that i adore you is but one of my truths
W: 
W: what of the mother whose house is in flames
W: and both of her children are in their beds crying
W: and she loves them both with the whole of her heart
W: but she knows she can only carry one at a time?
W: she's choking on the smoke of unthinkable choices
W: she is haunted by the voices of so many desires
W: she's bent over from the business of begging forgiveness
W: while frantically running around putting out fires
W: 
W: but then what kind of scale compares the weight of two beauties
W: the gravity of duties or the ground speed of joy?
W: tell me what kind of gauge can quantify elation?
W: what kind of equation could i possibly employ?
W: and you'll never know, dear just how much i loved you
W: you probably think this was just my big excuse
W: but i stand committed to a love that came before you
W: and the fact that i adore you is just one of my truths
W: 
W: so I, - i'm goin' home
W: to please the one i so love pleasing
W: and i don't expect

W: that we pay for the privilege
W: of living for even a day
W: in a world with so many things
W: worth believing in

W: Down the street you can hear her scream you’re a disgrace
W: 
W: As she slams the door in his drunken face
W: 
W: And now he stands outside
W: 
W: And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool
W: 
W: He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
W: 
W: What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
W: 
W: Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
W: 
W: And his tears fall and burn the garden green
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand fall into the sea, eventually
W: 
W: A little indian brave who before he was ten,
W: 
W: Played wargames in the woods with his indian friends
W: 
W: And he built up a dream that when he grew up
W: 
W: He would be a fearless warrior indian cheif
W: 
W: Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
W: 
W: Tomorrow he would sing his first warsong and fight his first battle

W: night
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually
W: 
W: There was a young girl, whos heart was a frown
W: 
W: cause she was crippled for life,
W: 
W: And she couldn’t speak a sound
W: 
W: And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
W: 
W: So she decided to die
W: 
W: She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
W: 
W: And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
W: 
W: But then a sight shed never seen made her jump and say
W: 
W: Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
W: 
W: And it really didn’t have to stop, it just kept on going...
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually

W: All along the lee shore
W: 
W: shells lie scattered in the sand
W: 
W: Winking up like shining eyes, at me,
W: 
W: from the sea
W: 
W: Here is one like sunrise
W: 
W: older than you know
W: 
W: It's still lying there where some careless wave
W: 
W: Forgot it long ago
W: 
W: When I woke this morning
W: 
W: dove beneath my floating home
W: 
W: Down below my graceful side, In the turning tide
W: 
W: To watch the sea fish roam
W: 
W: There I heard a story
W: 
W: from the sailors of the Sandra Marie
W: 
W: There's another island a days' run away from here
W: 
W: And it’s empty and free
W: 
W: From here to Venezuela
W: 
W: nothing more than to see
W: 
W: Than a hundred thousand islands, flung like jewels upon the sea
W: 
W: For you and me
W: 
W: Sunset smells of dinner
W: 
W: Women are calling at me to end the tales
W: 
W: But perhaps I'll see you the next quiet place
W: 
W: I furl my sails

V:1 
W: 
W: Don't tell me you don't know what love is
W: 
W: When you're old enough to know better
W: 
W: When you find strange hands in your sweater
W: 
W: When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote

W: And I'm giving you a longing look
W: 
W: Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book
W: 
W: Chapter One we didn't really get along
W: 
W: Chapter Two I think I fell in love with you
W: 
W: You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three
W: 
W: But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four, Five and Six
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: 
W: The way you walk
W: 
W: The way you talk, and try to kiss me, and laugh
W: 
W: In four or five paragraphs
W: 
W: All your compliments and your cutting remarks
W: 
W: Are captured here in my quotation marks
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: 
W: Don't tell me you don't know the difference
W: 
W: Between a lover and a fighter
W: 
W: With my pen and my electric typewriter
W: 
W: Even in a perfect world where everyone was equal
W: 
W: I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

W: On September twelfth right here
W: In front of the Waverly but unfortunately
W: I lost his address
W: 
W: He was last seen with his friend
W: A drummer, he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles
W: But he wears his hair
W: Tied in a small bow at the back
W: 
W: I love him but it embarrasses me
W: To walk down the street with him
W: He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
W: And wears this white crash helmet
W: He has golden chains on his leather jacket
W: And on the back are written the names
W: 'Mary and Mom
W: And Hell's Angels'
W: 
W: I would gratefully appreciate it
W: If you see him, tell him
W: I'm in the park with my girlfriend
W: And please
W: Tell him Angela and I
W: Don't want the two dollars back

W: Hello you, hello me, hello people we used to be      Em - G
W: Isn't it strange, we never changed
W: We've been through it all yet we're still the same
W: And I know it's a miracle, we still go, and for all we know
W: We might still have a way to go
W: Hello me, hello you, you say you want out
W: Want to start anew, throw in your hand
W: Break up the band, start a new life, be a new man
W: But for all we know, we might still have a way to go
W: Before you go, there's something you ought to know
W: There's a guy in my block, he lives for rock
W: He plays records day and night
W: And when he feels down, he puts some rock 'n' roll on
W: And it makes him feel alright
W: And when he feels the world is closing in
W: He turns his stereo way up high
W: He just spends his life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: He just spends his life, living on the edge of reality
W: He just spends his life, in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: He just spends his life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: He just spends his life, living on the edge of reality
W: He just spends his life, in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: He just spends his life, livingt in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: Look at me, look at you
W: You say you've got nothing left to prove
W: The king is dead, rock is done
W: You might be through but I've just begun
W: I don't know, I feel free and I won't let go
W: Before you go, there's something you ought to know
W: Dan is a fan and he lives for our music
W: It's the only thing that gets him by
W: He's watched us grow and he's seen all our shows
W: He's seen us low and he's seen us high
W: Oh, but you and me keep thinking
W: That the world's just passing us by
W: Don't' want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: Don't want to spend my life living on the edge of reality
W: Don't want to waste my life, hiding away anymore
W: Don't want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy...

W: Now I've heard there was a secret chord
W: That David played, and it pleased the Lord
W: But you dont really care for music, do you?
W: It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W: The minor falls, the major lifts
W: The baffled king composing Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Your faith was strong but you needed proof
W: You saw her bathing on the roof
W: Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
W: She tied you to a kitchen chair
W: She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
W: And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Well baby I've been here before
W: I know this room and I've walked this floor
W: You see I used to live alone before I knew ya
W: And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
W: But listen love, love is not some kind of victory march, no
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: 
W: There was a time you let me know
W: What's really going on below
W: But now you never show it to me, do you?
W: And I remember when I moved in you
W: And the holy dove she was moving too
W: And every single breath we drew was Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Well, maybe there's a God above
W: As for me all I've ever learned from love
W: Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
W: But it's not a crime that you're hear tonight
W: It's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the Light
W: No, it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah
W:

W: That everybody's crazy
W: A woman's voice reminds me
W: To serve and not to speak
W: Am I myself or just another freak?
W: 
W: You know there's fire in the hole
W: And nothing left to burn
W: I'd love to run out now
W: There's nowhere left to turn, no, no
W: 
W: With a cough, I shake it off
W: And work around my yellow stripe
W: Should I hide or eat my pride
W: Or wait until it's good and ripe?
W: My life is boiling over
W: It's happened once before
W: I wish someone would open up the door
W: 
W: Don't you know there's fire in the hole?
W: And nothing left to burn
W: I'd love to run out now

W: 
W: Some people say that life’s a game, well if this is so I’d like to
W: know
W: 
W: The rules of which this game of life is based
W: 
W: I know no game more fitting, than the age old game of cricket
W: 
W: It has honor, it has character, and it’s British
W: 
W: Now God laid down these rules of life when he wrote those ten
W: commandments
W: 
W: And to cricket those same ten rules shall apply
W: 
W: So show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all
W: 
W: and come to Gods call    with bat and ball
W: 
W: Now the devil has a player and he’s called the demon Bowler
W: 
W: He’s schrewd, he’s rude and he’s wicked
W: 
W: He’s sent by sinful Satan and he’s out to take your wicket
W: 
W: And you know that that’s not cricket
W: 
W: He’ll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and offspin
W: 
W: So keep a level head and don’t let that demon in
W: 
W: So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide
W: 
W: And you’ll get by,    yes you’ll get by
W: 
W: All through your life, he’ll try to bowl you out
W: 
W: Beware the demon Bowler
W: 
W: He’s crafty and deceitful and he’ll try to LBW
W: 
W: And bowl a maiden over
W:

W: 
W: In L.A., you know where that's at
W: 
W: And no one's gettin' fat except Mama Cass
W: 
W: Zally said "Denny, you know there aren't many
W: 
W: Who can sing a song the way that you do, let's go south"
W:

B: charlotte songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Otto Titsling, inventor and kraut,
W: 
W: had nothing to get very worked up about.
W: 
W: His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak.
W: 
W: He fled to the opera at least twice a week.
W: 
W: One night at the opera he saw an Aida
W: 
W: who's t-ts were so big they would often impede her.
W: 
W: Bug-eyed he watched her fall into the pit,
W: 
W: done in by the weight of those terrible t-ts.
W: 
W: Oh, my god! There she blows!
W: 
W: Aerodynamically this bitch was a mess.
W: 
W: Otto eyeballed the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds,
W: 
W: and he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration
W: 
W: flood his soul. He knew what he had to do!
W: 
W: He ran back to his workshop
W: 
W: where he futzed and futzed and futzed.
W: 
W: For Otto Titsling had found his quest:
W: 
W: to lift and mold the female breast;
W: 
W: to point the small ones to the sky;
W: 
W: to keep the big ones high and dry!
W: 
W: Every night he'd sweat and snort
W: 
W: searching for the right support.
W: 
W: He tried some string and paper clips.
W: 
W: Hey! He even tried his own two lips!
W: 
W: Well, he stitched and he slaved
W: 
W: and he slaved and he stitched
W: 
W: until finally one night, in the wee hours of morning,
W: 
W: Otto arose from his workbench triumphant.
W: 
W: Yes! He had invented the worlds first
W: 
W: over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder. Hooray!
W: 
W: Exhausted but ecstatic he ran
W: 
W: down the street to the diva's house
W: 
W: bearing the prototype in his hot little hand.
W: 
W: Now, the diva did not want to try the darn thing on.
W: 
W: But, after many initial misgivings,
W: 
W: she finally did.
W: 
W: And the sigh of relief that issued forth
W: 
W: from the diva's mouth
W: 
W: was so loud that it was mistaken by some
W: 
W: to be the early onset of the Siroccan Winds
W: 
W: which would often roll through the Schwarzwald
W: 
W: with a vengeance!
W: 
W: Ahhhhh-i!
W: 
W: But little did Otto know,
W: 
W: at the moment of his greatest triumph,
W: 
W: lurking under the diva's bed
W: 
W: was none other than the very worst
W: 
W: of the French patent thieves,
W: 
W: Philippe DeBrassiere.
W: 
W: And Phil was watching the scene
W: 
W: with a great deal of interest!
W: 
W: Later that night, while our Brun Hilda slept,
W: 
W: into the wardrobe Philippe softly crept.
W: 
W: He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore,
W: 
W: 'til he found Otto's titsling and he ran out the door.
W: 
W: Crying, "Oh, my god! What joy! What bliss!
W: 
W: I'm gonna make me a million from this!
W: 
W: Every woman in the world will wanna buy one.
W: 
W: I can have all the goods manufactured in Taiwan."
W: 
W: "Oh, thank you!"
W: 
W: The result of this swindle is pointedly clear:
W: 
W: Do you buy a titsling or do you buy a brassiere?

V:1 
W: 
W: When the rain is blowing in your face
W: And the whole world is on your case
W: I could offer you a warm embrace
W: To make you feel my love
W: 
W: When the evening shadows and the stars appear
W: And there is no one there to dry your tears
W: I could hold you for a million years
W: To make you feel my love
W: 
W: I know you haven't made your mind up yet
W: But I would never do you wrong
W: I've known it from the moment that we met
W: No doubt in my mind where you belong
W: 
W: I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
W: I'd go crawling down the avenue
W: No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
W: To make you feel my love
W: 
W: The storms are raging on the rolling sea
W: And on the highway of regret
W: Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
W: You ain't seen nothing like me yet
W: 
W: I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
W: Nothing that I wouldn't do
W: Go to the ends of the Earth for you
W: To make you feel my love
W: To make you feel my love

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: We all like to watch in mesmerized trance
W: 
W: Two lovers entwined in a serpentine dance
W: 
W: A sensual display of infidelity and intent
W: 
W: Where passions run hotter
W: 
W: They coil much tighter
W: 
W: Coquettish their lack of consent
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Its lovers dance of death
W: 
W: Pure flirtation with each breath
W: 
W: It’s a power pirouette
W: 
W: On the switch blade of a knife
W: 
W: I watch you dance your tango
W: 
W: It’s so sexy it drives me crazy
W: 
W: Fully charged with electricity
W: 
W: Sparks are flying around the room
W: 
W: I want to have what she is having
W: 
W: My eyes tell me that it’s you
W: 
W: There’s only one thing I’m forgetting
W: 
W: The tango’s just for two
W: 
W: Solo over verse
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Oh I’m so jealous of your jealousy
W: 
W: Real seduction not just fantasy
W: 
W: Veiled in a shadow of complicity
W: 
W: My lips are moistened in the gloom
W: 
W: I’ll discover all your body
W: 
W: Kiss you on your bleeding wounds
W: 
W: There’s only one thing I’m forgetting
W: 
W: The tango’s just for two
W: 
W: Sway,  we’ll dance her memory away
W: 
W: Sway,  we’ll dance her memory away
W: 
W: Sway,  we’ll dance her memory away
W: 
W: Steaming tears on burning cheeks
W: 
W: There’ll be no need to speak
W: 
W: And when we both come up for air
W: 
W: Forever love we will declare
W: 
W: Yet we haven’t even met
W: 
W: The tango’s just for two

W: And your sisters do
W: But please don't
W: Please stop
W: This is not my obligation
W: What does my body have to do
W: With my gratitude?
W: Look at you
W: Little white lying
W: For the purpose of justifying
W: What you're trying to do
W: I know that you feel my resistance
W: I know that you heard what I said
W: Otherwise you wouldn't need the excuse
W: Thank you
W: For letting me stay here
W: Thank you for taking me in
W: I don't know where else
W: I would have turned
W: But I don't come and go
W: Like a pop song
W: That you can play incessantly
W: And then forget when it's gone
W: You can't write me off
W: And you don't turn me on
W: So don't change the rules
W: In an hour or two
W: I don't know what you and your
W: Sisters do
W: But please don't
W: Please stop
W: This is not my obligation
W: What does my body have to do

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Sixteen years  -
W: Sixteen banners united over the field
W: Where the good shepherd grieves
W: Desperate men, desperate women divided
W: Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves
W: 
W: Fortune calls
W: I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
W: Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
W: She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
W: On midsummer's eve, near the tower
W: 
W: The cold-blooded moon
W: The captain waits above the celebration
W: Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
W: Whose ebony face is beyond communication
W: The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
W: 
W: They shaved her head
W: She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
W: A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
W: I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
W: Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
W: 
W: I stumbled to my feet
W: I rode past destruction in the ditches
W: With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
W: Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
W: Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you
W: 
W: The palace of mirrors
W: Where dog soldiers are reflected
W: The endless road and the wailing of chimes
W: The empty rooms where her memory is protected
W: Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times
W: 
W: She wakes him up
W: Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
W: Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
W: She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
W: He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks
W: 
W: Gentlemen, he said
W: I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
W: I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
W: But Eden is burning, either getting ready for elimination
W: Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
W: 
W: Peace will come
W: With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
W: But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
W: And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
W: Between the King and the Queen of Swords

W: 
W: 
W: 
W: People are talkin, talking 'bout people
W: 
W: I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
W: 
W: They think we're lovers kept under covers
W: 
W: I just ignore it, but they keep saying
W: 
W: We laugh just a little too loud
W: 
W: We stand just a little too close
W: 
W: We stare just a little too long
W: 
W: Maybe they're seeing, something we don't, Darlin'
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: 
W: How about love?
W: 
W: I feel so foolish, I never noticed
W: 
W: You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
W: 
W: It took a rumor to make me wonder
W: 
W: Now I'm convinced I'm going under
W: 
W: Thinking 'bout you every day
W: 
W: Dreaming 'bout you every night
W: 
W: Hoping that you feel the same way
W: 
W: Now that we know it, let's really show it, Darlin'
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: 
W: A little mystery to figure out
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: 
W: How about love, love, love, love?
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about

C:Tom Waits

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: She sends me blue valentines
W: 
W: All the way from Philadelphia
W: 
W: To mark the anniversary
W: 
W: Of someone that I used to be
W: 
W: And it feels just like theres
W: 
W: A warrant out for my arrest
W: 
W: Got me checkin in my rearview mirror
W: 
W: And I'm always on the run
W: 
W: Thats why I changed my name
W: 
W: And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
W: 
W: To send me blue valentines
W: 
W: Like half forgotten dreams
W: 
W: Like a pebble in my shoe
W: 
W: As I walk these streets
W: 
W: And the ghost of your memory
W: 
W: Is the thistle in the kiss
W: 
W: And the burgler that can break a roses neck
W: 
W: It's the tatooed broken promise
W: 
W: That I hide beneath my sleeve
W: 
W: And I see you every time I turn my back
W: 
W: She sends me blue valentines
W: 
W: Though I try to remain at large
W: 
W: They're insisting that our love
W: 
W: Must have a eulogy
W: 
W: Why do I save all of this madness
W: 
W: In the nightstand drawer
W: 
W: There to haunt upon my shoulders
W: 
W: Baby I know
W: 
W: I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
W: 
W: With a blind and broken heart
W: 
W: That sleeps beneath my lapel
W: 
W: She sends me my blue valentines
W: 
W: To remind me of my cardinal sin
W: 
W: I can never wash the guilt
W: 
W: Or get these bloodstains off my handa
W: 
W: And it takes a lot of whiskey
W: 
W: To take this nightmares go away
W: 
W: And I cut my bleedin heart out every nite
W: 
W: And I die a little more on each St. Valentines day
W: 
W: Remember that I promised I would
W: 
W: Write you...
W: 
W: These blue valentines
W: 
W: blue valentines
W:

B: charlotte songs

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness,
W: Part this red river of pain.
W: 
W: I don't necessarily buy
W: Any key to the future or happiness
W: But I need a little place in the sun sometimes
W: Or I think I'll die.
W: 
W: And everywhere is somewhere but nowhere is near.
W: Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.
W: But I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer. Heh.
W: 
W: Every time I see him he smiles
W: And tells me how well he's walking these miles.
W: But he never ever asks a single thing about me.
W: If I died he'd hear about it eventually.
W: 
W: Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness,
W: Part this red river of pain. Ohhh.
W: 
W: 'Cause everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.
W: Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.
W: And I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: With my bills in the mailbox and some checks that won't clear...... this year.
W: 
W: Everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.
W: Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.
W: So I'm just a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: Who'll sleep it off 'til morning and still not know that we're,
W: 
W: We're all just diamonds and roses. I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.

W: 
W: You who are on the road
W: 
W: Must have a code that you can live by
W: 
W: And so become yourself
W: 
W: Because the past is just a good-bye.
W: 
W: Teach your children well,
W: 
W: Their father's hell did slowly go by,
W: 
W: And feed them on your dreams
W: 
W: The one they picks, the one you'll know by.
W: 
W: Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
W: 
W: So just look at them and sigh
W: 
W: and know they love you.
W: 
W: And you, of tender years,
W: 
W: Can't know the fears that your elders grew by,
W: 
W: And so please help them with your youth,
W: 
W: They seek the truth before they can die.
W: 
W: Teach your parents well,
W: 
W: Their children's hell will slowly go by,
W: 
W: And feed them on your dreams
W: 
W: The one they picks, the one you'll know by.
W: 
W: Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
W: 
W: So just look at them and sigh and know they love you.

W: Who cares for charity
W: that comes from black eyes like these?
W: Deep and dark always searching
W: Somewhere around the breakfast there's plenty
W: Table set, the supper is ready
W: The feast is attended by the gypsy
W: 
W: CHORUS A:
W: I follow you today
W: Where the children they run and play
W: 
W: Kneeling on the street
W: Kneeling by the sea
W: First next day you walked with me
W: 
W: CHORUS B:
W: Our black eyes
W: Our black eyes
W: Go out into the world
W: No doubt
W: you are strong
W: You came for me
W: I was unharmed
W: 
W: The thread is bare, the buttons worn
W: The coat I wear is old and torn
W: Dirty and needing mending
W: Not asking for your company
W: I've been with your understudy and
W: The broken beaten blocks of the city

W: And a freight train running through the middle of my head

W: Than go with a boy or two
W: Even though the neighborhood
W: Thinks I'm trashy and no good
W: I suppose it could be true
W: But there are worse things I could do
W: 
W: I could flirt with all the guys
W: Smile at them and bat my eyes
W: Press against them when we dance
W: Make them think they stand a chance
W: Then refuse to see it through
W: That's a thing I'd never do
W: 
W: I could stay home every night
W: Wait around for Mr.Right
W: Take cold showers every day
W: And throw my life away
W: On a dream that won't come true
W: 
W: I could hurt someone like me
W: Out of spite or jealousy
W: I don't steal and I don't lie
W: But I can feel and I can cry
W: A fact I'll bet you never knew
W: But to cry in front of you
W: That's the worst thing I could do-oo

W: And in your eyes are a mountain too
W: And I see the fire in me and you
W: And in our eyes the mountains blue
