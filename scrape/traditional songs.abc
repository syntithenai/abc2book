W: Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
W: That saved a wretch; like me!
W: I once was lost, but now am found,
W: Was blind, but now I see.
W: 
W: ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
W: And grace my fears relieved;
W: How precious did that grace appear
W: The hour I first believed!
W: 
W: The Lord hath promised good to me,
W: His word my hope secures;
W: He will my shield and portion be
W: As long as life endures.
W: 
W: When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
W: Bright shining as the sun,
W: We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
W: Than when we first begun.

W: My thoughts today,	 though I'm	 far away,
W: Dwell	 on Tyrconnell's	 shore,
W: The	 salt sea air	 and the	 colleens fair,
W: Of	 lovely	 green Gwee	dore.
W: There's a	 flower there, bey	ond compare,
W: That I'll	 treasure	 ever	more,
W: That	 grand colleen,	 in her	 gown of green,
W: She's the	 Rose of	 Aranmore.
W: 
W: 
W: I've travelled far 'neath the northern star,
W: Since the day I said goodbye,
W: And seen many maids in the golden glades
W: Beneath a tropic sky,
W: There's a vision in my reverie,
W: I always will adore,
W: That grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.
W: 
W: 
W: But soon I will return again
W: To the scenes I loved so well,
W: Where many an Irish lad and lass
W: Their tales of love do tell;
W: The silvery dunes and blue lagoons,
W: Along the Rosses' shore
W: And that grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.

W: There's a fairmer up in Cairnie, that's kent frae far an' wide
W: Tae be the great Drumdelgie by yonder Deveronside.
W: Noo, the fairmer o' you muckle toon, he is baith hard an' sair,
W: An' the cauldest day that ever blaws, his servants get their share.
W: 
W: At five o'clock we quickly rise and hurry doon the stair;
W: It's there tae corn oor horses, likewise tae straik their hair.
W: Syne, after workin' half an hour, each tae the kitchen goes;
W: It's there to get oor breakfast, which is generally brose.
W: 
W: Noo we hadna gotten oor brose weel supped, an' gi'en oor pints a tie,
W: When the foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, the hour is drawin' nigh!”
W: At six o'clock the mill's put on, tae gi'e us a' strait wark;
W: It tak's four o' us tae mak' her, till ye could wring oor sark.
W: 
W: But when daylicht begins tae peep, and the sky begins tae clear,
W: The foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, ye'll bide nae langer here,
W: It's six o' you will gae tae the ploo, twa will ca' the neeps,
W: And the owsen they'll be after ye when they get on their feet!”
W: 
W: But lang ere we were gannin' forth and turnin' oot tae yoke,
W: The snaw cam' on sae thick and fast that we were like tae choke.
W: The frost it bein' so very bad, the ploo she widna go;
W: Aye, and so our cairtin days commenced among the frost an' snaw.
W: 
W: Oor horses bein' sae young and sma', the shafts they widna fill,
W: And they oft required the saddler tae help ‘em up the hill.
W: But we will sing oor horses' praise, tho' they be young and sma',
W: For they far outshine the Broadlands anes that gang sae full an' braw.
W: 
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, for I maun gang awa'.
W: Oh, fare the weel, Drumdelgie, your weepie' weather an' a'.
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, an' I bid ye a' adieu,
W: An' I leave ye as I got ye, a maist unceevil crew.

W: We'll rise and give them a blow, a blow

W: Oh! our soldier lads looked stout, looked stout
W: With their tartan kilts and all, and all
W: With their bonnets and feathers and glittering gear
W: And bagpipes sounding loud and clear
W: 
W: Will they all return to their own dear glen?
W: Will they all return our Highland men?
W: Second sighted Sandy looked full of woe
W: And mothers cried when they marched away

W: Oh! what is foremost of all, of all
W: Bonnie Charlie the King of us all, hurrah!
W: With his hundred pipers, and all, and all
W: 
W: His bonnet and feathers he's waving high
W: His prancing steed almost seems to fly
W: The north wind plays with his curly hair
W: While the pipers play with a strange flare
W: 
W: (chorus)
W: 
W: The Esk was swollen so red and so deep
W: But shoulder to shoulder the brave lads keep;
W: Two thousand swam over to fell English ground
W: And danced themselves dry to the bagpipe's sound
W: 
W: Dumfounded the English saw, they saw
W: Dumfounded they heard the blow, the blow
W: Dumfounded they all ran away, away
W: From the hundred pipers and all, and all

W: O see the fleet-foot host of men, who march with faces drawn,
W: From farmstead and from fishers' cot, along the banks of Ban;
W: They come with vengeance in their eyes. Too late! Too late are
W: they,
W: For young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: Oh Ireland, Mother Ireland, you love them still the best
W: The fearless brave who fighting fall upon your hapless breast,
W: But never a one of all your dead more bravely fell in fray,
W: Than he who marches to his fate on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Up the narrow street he stepped, so smiling, proud and young.
W: About the hemp-rope on his neck, the golden ringlets clung;
W: There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, fearless and brave are
W: they,
W: As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: When last this narrow street he trod, his shining pike in hand
W: Behind him marched, in grim array, a earnest stalwart band.
W: To Antrim town! To Antrim town, he led them to the fray,
W: But young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: The grey coat and its sash of green were brave and stainless then,
W: A banner flashed beneath the sun over the marching men;
W: The coat hath many a rent this noon, the sash is torn away,
W: And Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Oh, how his pike flashed in the sun! Then found a foeman's heart,
W: Through furious fight, and heavy odds he bore a true man's part
W: And many a red-coat bit the dust before his keen pike-play,
W: But Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: There's never a one of all your dead more bravely died in fray
W: Than he who marches to his fate in Toomebridge town today;
W: True to the last! True to the last, he treads the upwards way,
W: And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.

W: The morn was breaking bright and fair,
W: The lark sang in the sky,
W: When the maid she bound her goIden hair,
W: With a blythe glance in her eye;
W: For, who beyond the gay green-wood,
W: Was a-waiting her with joy,
W: Oh, who but her gallant Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: Up on the mountains high.
W: 
W: Full often in the dawning hour,
W: Full oft in twilight brown
W: He met the maid in the woodland bower,
W: Where the stream comes foaming down
W: For they were faithful in a love
W: No wars could e'er destroy.
W: No tyrant's law touched Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: "Dear love", she said, "l am so afraid,
W: For the foeman's force and you
W: They've tracked you in the lowland plain
W: And all the valley through.
W: My kinsmen frown when you are named
W: Your life they would destroy
W: 'Beware,' they say, 'of Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy' "
W: 
W: "Fear not, fear not, sweetheart," he cried,
W: "Fear not the foe for me
W: No chain shall fall, whate'er betide,
W: On the arm that would be free!
W: Oh, leave your cruel kin and come,
W: When the lark is in the sky.
W: And it's with my gun I'll guard you,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy."
W: 
W: The morn has come, she rose and fled
W: From her cruel kin and home;
W: And bright the wood, and rosy red,
W: And the tumbling torrent's foam.
W: But the mist came down and the tempest roared,
W: And did all around destroy;
W: And a pale, drowned bride met Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.

W: In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
W: I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
W: As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
W: For so were her father and mother before
W: And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: She died of a fever and no one could save her
W: And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
W: Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!

W: [Verse 1]
W: When the blackbird in the Spring
W: 'Neath the willow tree
W: Sat and rocked, I heard him sing
W: Singing Aura Lea!
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid of golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: [Verse 2]
W: In thy blush the rose was born
W: Music when you spake
W: In thine azure eye the morn
W: Sparkling, seemed to break
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and life return with thee
W: And swallows in the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Aura Lea! The bird may flee
W: The willow's golden hair
W: Swing through winter fitfully
W: On the stormy air
W: Yet if thy blue eyes I see
W: Gloom will soon depart
W: For to me, sweet Aura Lea
W: Is sunshine through the heart
W: 
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: When the mistletoe was green
W: Midst the winter's snows
W: Sunshine in thy face was seen
W: Kissing lips of rose
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and light return with thee
W: And swallows with the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air

W: As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
W: How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
W: Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
W: I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here
W: 
W: I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
W: Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold
W: In letters made of gold my love, believe me when I say
W: You are the one that I will adore until my dying day
W: 
W: The blackest crow that ever flew would surely turn to white
W: If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
W: Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
W: If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
W: 
W: And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
W: And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
W: And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
W: That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee

W: I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill,
W: And over the moorland sedgy,
W: Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill,
W: Since parting from my Sally.
W: I seek no more the fine and gay,
W: For each just does remind me
W: How sweet the hours I passed away,
W: With the girl I left behind me.
W: 
W: O ne'er shall I forget that night,
W: The stars were bright above me,
W: And gently lent their silvery light
W: When first she vowed to love me.
W: But now I'm bound to Brighton camp -
W: Kind heaven then pray guide me,
W: And send me safely back again,
W: To the girl I left behind me.
W: 
W: Her golden hair in ringlets fair,
W: Her eyes like diamonds shining,
W: Her slender waist, her heavenly face,
W: That leaves my heart still pining.
W: Ye gods above oh hear my prayer,
W: To my beauteous fair to find me,
W: And send me safely back again,
W: to the girl I left behind me.

W: High in the belfry the old sexton stands

W: Fix'd is his gaze as by some magic spell
W: Till he hears the distant murmur
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Chorus
W: Ring the bell, watchman! ring! ring! ring!
W: Yes, yes! the good news is now on the wing.
W: Yes, yes! they come and with tiding to tell
W: Glorious and blessed tidings. Ring, ring the bell!
W: 
W: Baring his long silver locks to the breeze
W: First for a moment he drops on his knees
W: Then with a vigor that few could excel
W: Answers he the welcome bidding
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Hear! from the hilltop, the first signal gun
W: Thunders the word that some great deed is done
W: Hear! thro' the valley the long echoes swell
W: Ever and anon repeating
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Bonfires are blazing and rockets ascend
W: No meagre triumph such tokens portend
W: Shout! shout! my brothers for "all, all is well!"
W: 'Tis the universal chorus
W: Ring, ring the bell

W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,

W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.
W: 
W: As I came down the new cut road,
W: Met Mr. Bullfrog, met Miss Toad
W: And every time Miss Toad would sing,
W: Old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.
W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
W: Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.
W: 
W: Oh I jumped in the seat and I gave a little yell
W: The horses ran away, broke the wagon all to hell
W: Sugar in the gourd and honey in the horn
W: I never been so happy since the day I was born.
W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
W: Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

W: In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn’t a shilling.
W: His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
W: Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
W: Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
W: There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea.
W: Nolans and Dolans and all the O’Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
W: While songs went round as plenty as water,
W: The harps that are sounded through Tara’s old hall,
W: Biddie Grey and the rat catcher’s daughter singing away at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
W: Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
W: Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
W: How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
W: I spent six months in Brook’s Academy learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
W: Dancing around in their couples and groups.
W: An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
W: He put his boot through Miss Finnerty’s hoops.
W: She fell down in a faint and cried, ‘Holy murder!’
W: Called her brothers and gathered them all.
W: Carmody swore he’d go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Boys oh boys ’tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
W: I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
W: Moloney the piper was near gettin’ smothered.
W: They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
W: Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS

W: As I walked down through Chatham Street
W: A fair maid I did meet
W: She asked me to see her home--
W: She lived in Bleecker Street
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: And when we got to Bleecker Street
W: We stopped at forty-four
W: Her mother and her sister there
W: To meet her at the door
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: And when I got inside the house
W: The drinks were passed around
W: The liquor was so awful strong
W: My head went round and round
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: And then we had another drink
W: Before we sat to eat
W: The liquor was so awful strong
W: I quickly fell asleep
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: When I awoke next morning
W: I had an aching head
W: There was I, Jack all alone
W: Stark naked in me bed
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: My gold watch and my pocketbook
W: And lady friend were gone;
W: And there was I, Jack all alone
W: Stark naked in the room
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: On looking round this little room
W: There's nothing I could see
W: But a woman's shift and apron
W: That were no use to me
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes
W: Down Cherry Street forlorn
W: There Martin Churchill took me in
W: And sent me 'round Cape Horn
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?

W: Early one day the sun wouldn't shine
W: I was walking down the street not feeling too fine
W: I saw two old men with a bottle between 'em
W: And this was the song that I heard them singing
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: Well I stopped by the steps where they was sitting
W: And I couldn't believe how drunk they were getting
W: I said "old men, have you been drinking long?"
W: They said "just long enough to be singing this song"
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: Well they passed me the bottle and I took a little sip
W: And it felt so good I just couldn't quit
W: I drank some more and next thing I knew
W: There were three of us sitting there singing this tune
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: One by one everybody in the town
W: They heard our ruckus and they all came down
W: And pretty soon all the streets were ringing
W: With the sound of the whole town laughing and singing

W: Oh once upon a time in Arkansas
W: An old man sat in his little cabin door
W: And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
W: A jolly old tune that he played by ear
W: 
W: It was raining hard but the fiddler didn’t care
W: He sawed away at the popular air
W: Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
W: That didn’t seem to bother the old man at all
W: 
W: A traveler was riding by that day
W: And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
W: The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
W: But the old man still didn’t seem to fret
W: 
W: So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
W: You’d better mend your roof said he
W: But the old man said as he played away
W: I couldn’t mend it now it’s a rainy day
W: 
W: The traveler replied that’s all quite true
W: But this I think is the thing for you to do
W: Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
W: Then patch the old roof till it’s good and tight
W: 
W: But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
W: And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
W: Get along said he for you give me a pain
W: My cabin never leaks when it doesn’t rain

W: So I can dance closer to the one that I love!

W: In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn’t a shilling.
W: His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
W: Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
W: Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
W: There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea.
W: Nolans and Dolans and all the O’Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
W: While songs went round as plenty as water,
W: The harps that are sounded through Tara’s old hall,
W: Biddie Grey and the rat catcher’s daughter singing away at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
W: Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
W: Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
W: How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
W: I spent six months in Brook’s Academy learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
W: Dancing around in their couples and groups.
W: An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
W: He put his boot through Miss Finnerty’s hoops.
W: She fell down in a faint and cried, ‘Holy murder!’
W: Called her brothers and gathered them all.
W: Carmody swore he’d go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Boys oh boys ’tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
W: I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
W: Moloney the piper was near gettin’ smothered.
W: They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
W: Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan’s ball.

W: For once she was a true love of mine.

W: On Raglan Road of an autumn day
W: I saw her first and knew
W: That her dark hair would weave a snare
W: That I might one day rue
W: I saw the danger and I passed
W: Along the enchanted way
W: And I said let grief be a fallen leaf
W: At the dawning of the day
W: 
W: On Grafton Street in November
W: We tripped lightly along the ledge
W: Of a deep ravine where can be seen
W: The worth of passion's pledge
W: The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
W: And I'm not making hay
W: Oh I love too much and by such by such
W: Is happiness thrown away
W: 
W: I gave her gifts of the mind
W: I gave her the secret signs
W: That known to the artists who have known
W: The true gods of sound and stone
W: And word and tint to without stint
W: I gave her poems to say
W: With her own name there
W: And her own dark hair
W: Like clouds over fields of May
W: 
W: On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
W: I see her walking now
W: Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
W: That I had loved not as I should
W: A creature made of clay
W: When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
W: His wings at the dawn of day

W: All God's creatures got a place in the choir,
W: Some sing low and some sing higher,
W: Some sing out loud on the telephone wire,
W: Some just clap their hands or paws or anything they got now.
W: 
W: [Repeat Chorus]
W: 
W: Listen to the top where the little birds sings,
W: And the melodies and the high notes ringing,
W: And the hoot-owl cries over everything,
W: And the blackbird disagrees.
W: 
W: Singing in the night time singing in the day,
W: And the little duck quacks and he's on his way,
W: And the otter hasn't got much to say,
W: And the porcupine talks to himself.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: Dogs and the cats, they take up the middle,
W: Where the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
W: The donkey brays and the pony neighs,
W: And the old gray badger sighs.
W: 
W: Listen to the bass its the one on the bottom,
W: Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus,
W: Moans and groans with a big to-do,
W: And the old cow just goes moo.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: Its a simple song little song everywhere,
W: By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear,
W: The dopey alligator and the hawk above,
W: The sly old weasel and the turtle dove.
W: 
W: [Chorus x3]

W: Draw me ever on life's journey, rendered thus to understand
W: 
W: As a songbird that is fallen, only to regain the sky
W: From this frozen shadow valley, they must weary fly
W: 
W: Love is from no distance calling, faithful as the rising sun
W: Warms the bitter heart and heartache, till the east of Eden's gone

W: For many years where I may lay
W: And you may learn to love another

W: Oh, the year was 1778
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: A letter of marque came from the King
W: To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: Oh Elcid Barrett, cried the town
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: For twenty brave men all fishermen who
W: Would make for him the Antelope's crew
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She'd a list to the port and and her sails in rags
W: And the cook in scuppers with the staggers and jags
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: On the King's birthday we put to sea
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay
W: Pumping like madmen all the way
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
W: With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Yankee lay low down with gold
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
W: But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: Then at length we stood two cables away
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
W: But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
W: And the main truck carried off both me legs
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: So here I lay in my twenty-third year
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: It's been six years since we sailed away
W: And I just made Halifax yesterday
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier

W: I see the clouds are drawing and the sun has gone away.
W: It fills me with foreboding cos I want the sun to stay
W: The sun it soaks right through me washing aches and pains away.
W: The rain it does as well, but it leaves me feeling grey.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Bring on the sun, let it drive away the cold and dampness.
W: Bring on the sun, drive away the rain.
W: Bring on the sun, let it fill my heart with gladness.
W: Bring on the sun, let it's joy into my day.
W: 
W: In the summer time I like to swim and walk and splash and sing.
W: But when the winter comes it brings a deadening within.
W: The cold it takes my fire, leaves me just a burning glow.
W: Till the sun it feeds the ashes and returns the vital flow.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: In the winter time it's nice to snuggle warm inside your bed.
W: With a raging fire going and a roof above your head.
W: But when the spring it starts to warm and makes it good to be outside.
W: I feel my spirit rising, know it's good to be alive.

W: Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
W: And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
W: Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
W: Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day  is  done
W: 
W: Oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song
W: And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
W: Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
W: Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this  day  is  done

W: A holiday, a holiday
W: And the first one of the year
W: Lord Donald's wife came into the church
W: The gospel for to hear
W: 
W: And when the meeting it was done
W: She cast her eyes about
W: And there she saw little Matty Groves
W: Walking in the crowd
W: 
W: "Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: Come home with me tonight
W: Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: And sleep with me 'til light"
W: "Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home
W: And sleep with you tonight
W: By the rings on your fingers I can tell
W: You are Lord Donald's wife"
W: 
W: "What if I am Lord Donald's wife?
W: Lord Donald's not at home
W: He is out in the far cornfields
W: Bringing the yearlings home"
W: 
W: And a servant who was standing by
W: And hearing what was said
W: He swore Lord Donald he would know
W: Before the sun would set
W: 
W: And in his hurry to carry the news
W: He bent his breast and ran
W: And when he came to the broad millstream
W: He took off his shoes and swam
W: 
W: Little Matty Groves, he lay down
W: And took a little sleep
W: When he awoke, Lord Donald
W: Was standing at his feet
W: 
W: Saying "How do you like my feather bed
W: And how do you like my sheets?
W: How do you like my lady
W: Who lies in your arms asleep?"
W: 
W: "Oh, well I like your feather bed
W: And well I like your sheets
W: But better I like your lady gay
W: Who lies in my arms asleep"
W: 
W: "Well, get up, get up," Lord Donald cried
W: "Get up as quick as you can
W: It'll never be said in fair England
W: I slew a naked man"
W: 
W: "Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up
W: I can't get up for my life
W: For you have two long beaten swords
W: And I not a pocket knife"
W: 
W: "Well it's true I have two beaten swords
W: And they cost me deep in the purse
W: But you will have the better of them
W: And I will have the worse
W: 
W: And you will strike the very first blow
W: And strike it like a man
W: I will strike the very next blow
W: And I'll kill you if I can"
W: 
W: So Matty struck the very first blow
W: And he hurt Lord Donald sore
W: Lord Donald struck the very next blow
W: And Matty struck no more
W: 
W: And then Lord Donald he took his wife
W: And he sat her on his knee
W: Saying "Who do you like the best of us
W: Matty Groves or me?"
W: 
W: And then up spoke his own dear wife
W: Never heard to speak so free
W: "I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips
W: Than you or your finery".
W: 
W: Lord Donald he jumped up
W: And loudly he did bawl
W: He struck his wife right through the heart
W: And pinned her against the wall
W: 
W: "A grave, a grave," Lord Donald cried
W: "To put these lovers in
W: But bury my lady at the top
W: For she was of noble kin”

W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
W: There are frail forms fainting at the door:
W: Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say –
W: Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W: 
W: Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
W: While we all sup sorrow with the poor:
W: There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
W: With a worn heart whose better days are o’er:
W: Though her voice would be merry, ’tis sighing all the day –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days have lingered around my cab in door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
W: ‘ Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore,
W: ‘ Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave, –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: ​Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

W: Comes a time when the past is past,
W: Full of dreams that couldn't last or grow.
W: I was a kid like a mother's sigh,
W: I'd watch those freight trains rushing by,
W: I'd hear that whistle blow.
W: Even now I'll stop to hear
W: A big freight truck a shifting gear ,
W: It's what I need to know.
W: 
W: I'll sing a travelling song,
W: But I get so tired of always moving on.
W: Summer's dead and autumn's here,
W: I can hold down my fear
W: And  spring will come again.
W: You see it's shining like the morning star,
W: That you can see so far,
W: Through the clear clear skies... the skies

W: [Verse 1]
W: Well, I recall his parting words
W: Must I accept his fate?
W: Or take myself far from this place
W: I thought I heard a black bell toll
W: A little bird did sing
W: Man has no choice when he wants everything
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: [Verse 2]
W: Man goes beyond his own decision
W: Gets caught up in the mechanism
W: Of swindlers who act like kings
W: And brokers who break everything
W: The dark of night was swiftly fading
W: Close to the dawn of day
W: Why would I want him just to lose him again?
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: Living on the road, my friend
W: Was gonna keep you free and clean
W: And now you wear your skin like iron
W: Your breath as hard as kerosene
W: You weren't your momma's only boy
W: But her favorite one, it seems
W: She began to cry when you said goodbye
W: And sank into your dreams
W: 
W: Pancho was a bandit boy
W: His horse was fast as polished steel
W: He wore his gun outside his pants
W: For all the honest world to feel
W: Pancho met his match, you know
W: On the deserts down in Mexico
W: Nobody heard his dying words
W: But that's the way it goes
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: They only let him slip away
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Lefty, he can't sing the blues
W: All night long like he used to
W: The dust that Pancho bit down South
W: Ended up in Lefty's mouth
W: The day they laid poor Pancho low
W: Lefty split for Ohio
W: Where he got the bread to go
W: There ain't nobody knows
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: We only let him slip away
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: The poets tell how Pancho fell
W: And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
W: The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
W: And so the story ends, we're told
W: Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
W: But save a few for Lefty too
W: He only did what he had to do
W: And now he's growing old
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: We could've had him any day
W: They only let him go so long
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: A few gray Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: They only let him go so long
W: Out of kindness, I suppose

W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

W: When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
W: Me money alas I spent too fast, got drunk as drunk could be
W: And when my money was all gone 'twas then I wanted more
W: But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: I spent the night with Angeline
W: Too drunk to roll in bed
W: My watch was new and my money too
W: In the mornin' with 'em she fled
W: And as I roamed the streets about
W: The whores they all would roar
W: Here comes Jack Rack, the young sailin' lad
W: He must go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: As I was walkin' down the street
W: I met with Rapper Brown
W: I asked for him to take me in
W: And he looked at me with a frown
W: He said "Last time you was paid off
W: With me you jobbed no score
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance
W: And I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance and I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: I hired me aboard of a whaling ship
W: Bound for the Artic seas
W: Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
W: And Jamaican rum would freeze
W: And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear
W: For I'd lost all my money ashore
W: 'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
W: So I'd gone to sea no more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more.
W: 
W: Some days we're catching whales me lads
W: And some days we're catching none
W: With a twenty foot oar cocked in our hands
W: From four o'clock in the morn
W: And when the shades of night come in
W: We rest on our weary oar
W: 'Twas then I wished that I was dead
W: Or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then I wished that I was dead or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: Come all you bold seafarin' men
W: And listen to my song
W: If you come off of them long trips
W: I'd have ya's not go wrong
W: Take my advice, drink no strong drink
W: Don't go sleeping with no whores
W: Get married instead and spend all night in bed
W: So you'll go to sea no more
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
W: The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
W: Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
W: And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
W: There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
W: We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
W: And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
W: That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
W: She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
W: But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
W: Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
W: But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
W: For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
W: And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
W: Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
W: Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
W: Or I'd never have the strength to go below
W: But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
W: Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
W: Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
W: She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
W: And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
W: They won't be laughing in another day
W: And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
W: With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
W: Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
W: And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

W: O the waves crash in and the tide pulls out
W: It's an angry sea but there is no doubt
W: That the lighthouse will keep shining out
W: To warn the lonely sailor
W: And the lightning strikes and the wind cuts cold
W: Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul
W: Till there's nothing left that he can hold
W: Except the rolling ocean
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm
W: 
W: Give me mercy for my dreams
W: For every confrontation seems
W: To tell me what it really means
W: To be this lonely sailor
W: But when the sky begins to clear
W: And the sun it melts away my fear
W: I'll cry a silent weary tear
W: For those that need to ove me
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm
W: 
W: But distance it is no real friend
W: And time it takes its time
W: But you will find that in the end
W: It brings you me the lonely sailor
W: But when you take me by your side
W: You love me warm, you love me
W: And I should have realized
W: I had no reasons to be frightened
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm

W: On the first day of March it was raining
W: It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen
W: I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there
W: I wish that all this rain would stop falling down on me
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: At the time I was working for a landlord
W: And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen
W: And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore
W: And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: I recall that we took care of him one Sunday
W: We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
W: And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
W: But all I know is I left the place without a penny or fuckall
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: But now I've the most charming of verandahs
W: I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores
W: Five green bottles sitting on the floor
W: I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ
W: That I had fifteen more
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: The boys and me are drunk and looking for you
W: We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn
W: Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam
W: And my brother earned his medals at My Lai in Vietnam
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning

W: One summer evening drunk to hell
W: I sat there nearly lifeless
W: An old man in the corner sang
W: "Where The Water Lilies Grow"
W: And on the jukebox Johnny sang
W: About a thing called love
W: And it's how are you kid and what's your name
W: And how would you bloody know?
W: 
W: In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
W: I lay down on the ground
W: And the arms and legs of other men
W: Were scattered all around
W: Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
W: Then prayed and bled some more
W: And the only thing that I could see
W: Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
W: But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
W: There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
W: [Chorus]
W: And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
W: For a pair of brown eyes
W: 
W: I looked at him he looked at me
W: All I could do was hate him
W: While Ray and Philomena sang
W: Of my elusive dreams
W: I saw the streams, the rolling hills
W: Where his brown eyes were waiting
W: And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
W: That waited once for me
W: 
W: So drunk to hell I left the place
W: Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
W: A hungry sound came across the breeze
W: So I gave the walls a talking
W: And I heard the sounds of long ago
W: From the old canal
W: And the birds were whistling in the trees
W: Where the wind was gently laughing
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: [Verse 1]
W: Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
W: He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
W: He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
W: And they all looked very happy in the morning
W: But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
W: Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
W: When he'd had too many Powers
W: So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving
W: And he took the road for God knows in the morning
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: The years passed by, the times had changed, I grew to be a man
W: I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally MacLennane
W: I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
W: And ended up a barman in the morning
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
W: I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
W: I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
W: And some people left for heaven without warning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone
W: He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
W: Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked
W: Took the road for heaven in the morning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)

W: There were once two Irish labouring men; to England they came over;
W: And they tramped about in search of work from Liverpool to Dover.
W: Says Mike to Pat, “I'm tired of this; we're both left in the lurch;
W: And if I don't get work, bedad, I'll go and rob a church.”
W: 
W: “What, rob a church!” says Pat to Mike; “How could you be so vile?
W: For something sure would happen while we're going down the aisle.
W: But if you do I'll go with you; and we'll get safe out, I hope;”
W: So, listen and I'll tell you now how Paddy stole the rope.
W: 
W: While off they went with theft intent to the place they wanted finding;
W: And they broke inside of a country church where nobody was minding.
W: And they scraped together all they could, they were prepared to slope,
W: When Paddy says, “Now hold on, Mike, what have we got for rope?
W: 
W: For we have no bag to hold our swag, and before we get outside,
W: With something strong and stout, my lad, this bundle must be tied.”
W: And just then he spied the church bell rope, and before you could turn about,
W: He did ride up the belfry high to climb that rope so stout.
W: 
W: And holding on by one hand and leg, he pulled his clasp knife out,
W: And right above his hand and head he cut that rope so stout.
W: Well, he quite forgot it held him up, and, by the Holy Pope,
W: Down to the bottom of the church fell Paddy and the rope.
W: 
W: “Come out of that,” says Mike to Pat, “and will you stop your moaning,
W: “If that's the way you steal a rope, it's no wonder that you're groaning.
W: I'll show you how to steal the rope, if you lend to me your knife.”
W: “O Mike, go easy,” says old Pat, “or else you'll lose your life.”
W: 
W: So Mike climbed up the other rope, just like an antelope
W: But instead of cutting it off above, he cut it off below.
W: Down fell the other piece of rope and Mike was left on high.
W: “Come down”, says Pat. “I can't,” says Mick, “for if I drop, I'll die.”
W: 
W: Well their noise it brought the beagles out, the sexton and police,
W: And though they got poor Micky down, they spared them no release.
W: And for their ingenuity they have now a wider scope
W: Than when they broke inside a church to go and steal the rope.

W: In the Year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Six
W: We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
W: We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
W: For the grand City Hall in New York
W: She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
W: And lord how the trade winds drove her
W: She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
W: And they called her the Irish Rover
W: 
W: There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
W: There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W: There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
W: And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
W: And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W: And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
W: Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W: We had two million barrels of bone
W: We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
W: We had four million barrels of stone
W: We had five million hogs and six million dogs
W: And seven million barrels of porter
W: We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
W: In the hold of the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
W: And our ship lost her way in the fog
W: And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
W: 'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
W: Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
W: We nearly tumbled over
W: Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
W: Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

W: [Verse 1]
W: The canals and the bridges, the embankments and cuts
W: They blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts
W: They never drank water but whiskey by pints
W: And the shanty towns rang with their songs and their fights
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Navigator, navigator rise up and be strong
W: The morning is here and there's work to be done
W: Take your pick and your shovel and the bold dynamite
W: For to shift a few tons of this earthly delight
W: Yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight
W: [Verse 2]
W: They died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where
W: Save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur
W: By landslide and rockblast they got buried so deep
W: That in death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: [Verse 3]
W: Their mark on this land is still seen and still laid
W: The way for a commerce where vast fortunes were made
W: The supply of an empire where the sun never set
W: Which is now deep in darkness, but the railway's there yet
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: In a grand ol city of London
W: Apprentice to a trade I was bound
W: And many's an hour's sweet happiness
W: Have I spent in this neat little town.
W: A sad misfortune came over me
W: Which caused me to stray from the land
W: Far away from my friends and relations
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.

W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.

W: I took a stroll down Broadway
W: Meaning not long for to stay
W: When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
W: Came a traipsing along the highway
W: She was both fair and handsome
W: Her neck it was just like a swans'
W: And her hair is hung over her shoulder
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W:

W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
W: And the gentleman passing us by
W: Well I knew she meant the doing of him
W: By the look in her roguish black eye
W: A gold watch she took from his pocket
W: And placed it right into my hand
W: And the very first thing I said was
W: Bad 'cess to the black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders

W: Next morning I had to appear
W: And the judge he said to me 'Young man
W: Your case is proven clear'
W: We'll give you seven years penal servitude

W: Far away from your friends and companions
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.

W: 
W: It's adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu,
W: I am going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.
W: Come change your ring with me, dear girl,
W: Come change your ring with me,
W: For it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.
W: 
W: And when I'm far upon the sea you'll know not where I am.
W: Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.
W: The secrets of your heart, dear girl,
W: Are the best of my good will,
W: So let my body be where it might, my heart will be with you still.
W: 
W: There's tinkers, tailors, shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing through the deep.
W: There's nothing to protect us, love,
W: Or keep us from the cold,
W: On the ocean wide, where we must fight like jolly seamen bold.
W: 
W: There's a heavy storm arising, see how it gathers round,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.
W: Our officers commanded us,
W: And them we must obey,
W: Expecting every moment for to get cast away.
W: 
W: But when the war is over, there'll be peace on every shore,
W: We'll return to our wives and out families, and the girls that we adore.
W: We'll drink out liquor merrily,
W: And spend out money free,
W: And when the money is all gone -- we'll boldly go to sea.

W: And your beauty will haunt me, wherever I go

W: 
W: One day when she had nothing to do,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
W: One day when she had nothing to do,
W: She cut her baby brother in two,

W: 
W: And when at last the police came by,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
W: And when at last the police came by,
W: Her little pranks she did not deny,

W: And lying, she knew, was a sin, a sin,
W: Lying, she knew, was a sin.
W: 
W: My tragic tale, I won't prolong,
W: Rickety-tickety-tin,
W: My tragic tale I won't prolong,
W: And if you do not enjoy the song,
W: You've yourselves to blame if it's too long,
W: You should never have let me begin, begin,
W: You should never have let me begin.

W: Have you seen him on the corner
W: His lips would reach the pavement
W: He's been hiding from the razor
W: Is he not an awful sight
W: In love he was the purest
W: Now he's frightening the tourists
W: If he'd gone and asked his father
W: Oh i'm sure he'd set him right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"
W: And tell her that you love her
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: Hold that woman tight
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: And tell her that you love her
W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Now he met her at a disco
W: In a dive in San Francisco
W: And it all might have been different
W: Had he seen her in daylight
W: She was painted she was scented
W: But she drove your man demented
W: If he'd gone and asked his father
W: Oh i'm sure he'd set him right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"

W: 
W: Now depression's not a million laughs
W: But suicide's so dangerous
W: Don't go leapin' out of buildings
W: In the middle of the night
W: It's not the fall but landing
W: That will alter social standing
W: So go first and ask your father
W: And I'm sure he'll set you right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"
W: And tell her that you love her
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: Hold that woman tight
W: Won't you take her in your arms

W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Here's a health to all true lovers
W: Their sisters and their brothers
W: And their uncles and their grannies
W: For this thing is black and white
W: If you're keen to start romancing
W: With its leapin' and its dancin'
W: Then go first and ask your father
W: And I'm sure he'll set you right

W: Saint Patrick was a gentleman
W: And he came from decent people
W: In Dublin town he built a church
W: And on it, put the steeple
W: 
W: His father was a Callaghan
W: His mother was a Brady
W: His auntie an O'Shaughnessy
W: Hus uncle an O'Grady
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists
W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!
W: There's not a mile in Erin's isle
W: Where the dirty vermin musters
W: Where there he put his dear forefoot
W: He murdered them in clusters
W: 
W: The toads went hop! The frogs went pop!
W: Slap-dash into the water
W: And beasts committed suicide
W: To save themselves from slaughter
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists
W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!
W: 
W: The Wicklow hills are very high
W: And so is the hill of Howth, sir
W: And there's a hill much bigger still
W: Much higher than them both, sir
W: 
W: 'Twas on the top of this high hill
W: Saint Patrick preached his sermons
W: He drove the frogs into the bogs
W: And banished all the vermins
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists
W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!
W: No wonder that those Irish lads
W: Should be so gay and frisky
W: Well, sure, Saint Pat, he taught them that
W: As well as makin' whiskey
W: 
W: No wonder that the saint himself
W: Should understand distillin'
W: His mother kept a shebeen shop
W: In the town of Enniskillen
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists
W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!

W: In South Australia I was born!
W: Heave away! Haul away!
W: South Australia round Cape Horn!
W: We're bound for South Australia!
W:

W: Heave away, you rolling king,
W: Heave away! Haul away!

W: As I walked out one morning fair,
W: It's there I met Miss Nancy Blair.
W: 
W: I shook her up, I shook her down,
W: I shook her round and round the town.
W: 
W: There ain't but one thing grieves my mind,
W: It's to leave Miss Nancy Blair behind.
W: 
W: And as you wallop round Cape Horn,
W: You'll wish to Christ you'd never been born!
W: 
W: Up the coast to Vallipo,
W: Northward on to Callao.
W: 
W: It's back again to Liverpool,
W: I spent me pay like a bloody fool!
W: 
W: I'm Liverpool born and Liverpool bred,
W: Long in the arm and thick in the head.
W: 
W: Oh, rock and roll me over boys,
W: Let's get this damn job over boys.

W: There were three auld gypsies came to our hall door.
W: They came brave and boldly-o.
W: And one sang high and the other sang low
W: And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o.
W: 
W: It was upstairs, downstairs the lady went,
W: Put on her suit of leather-o,
W: And it was the cry all around her door;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: It was late that night when the lord came in,
W: Enquiring for his lady-o,
W: And the servant girl’s reply to him was;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Then saddle for me my milk-white steed
W: Me big horse is not speedy-o
W: And I will ride and I’ll seek me bride,
W: She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: He rode east and he rode west
W: He rode north and south also,
W: And when he rode to the wide open field
W: It was there that he spied his lady-o.
W: 
W: “Arra, why did you leave your house and your land,
W: Why did you leave your money-o?
W: Why did you leave your only wedded lord
W: All for the raggle taggle gypsy-o?”
W: 
W: “Yerra what do I care for me house and me land?
W: What do I care for money-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “It was there last night you’d a goose feather bed,
W: Blankets drawn so comely-o.
W: But tonight you lie in a wide open field
W: In the arms of the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Yerra, what do I care for me goose feather bed?
W: Yerra, what do I care for blankets-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Oh, for you rode east when I rode west,
W: You rode high and I rode low.
W: I’d rather have a kiss of the yellow gypsy’s lips
W: Than all the cash and money-o”

W: In another younger day I could dream the time away
W: In the universe inside my room
W: And the world was really mine from june til september
W: And if it wasn't really so I was lucky not to know
W: And I was lucky not to wonder why
W: Because the summer time is all that I remember
W: 
W: A summer fly was buzzin' every night when I was young
W: In the gentle world my childlike senses knew
W: And the world was just my cousin
W: And the wind was just the tongue
W: In the voice my lonely moments listened to
W: 
W: And I look at me today all the dreams have gone away
W: And I'm where I never thought I would be
W: Seein' things I never thought I would see happen'en to me
W: And I lay awake at night til the darkness turns to light
W: Hearin' voices callin' out my name
W: Dronin' over and again the same message to me
W: 
W: Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's
W: Your baby now?
W: Who wakes up at night to pull you in
W: But it don't matter, you'll just make her lonely anyhow
W: I don't know why you even try to win

W: One Sunday morning as I went walking, by the Brisbane's waters I chanced to stray,
W: I heard a convict his fate bewailing, as on the sunny river bank he lay;
W: "I am a native of Erin's island but banished now to the fatal shore,
W: They tore me from my aged parents and from the maiden I do adore.
W: 
W: "I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie, Norfolk Island and Emu Plains,
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie, at all those settlements I've worked in chains;
W: But of all those places of condemnation, in each penal station of New South Wales,
W: To Moreton Bay I've found no equal: excessive tyranny there each day prevails.
W: 
W: "For three long years I was beastly treated, heavy irons on my legs I wore,
W: My back from flogging it was lacerated, and often painted with crimson gore,
W: And many a lad from downright starvation lies mouldering humbly beneath the clay,
W: Where Captain Logan he had us mangled on his triangles at Moreton Bay.
W: 
W: "Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews, we were oppressed under Logan's yoke,
W: Till a native black who lay in ambush did give our tyrant his mortal stroke.
W: Fellow prisoners, be exhilarated, that all such monsters such a death may find!
W: And when from bondage we are liberated, our former sufferings shall fade from mind."

W: A gypsy came to the castle gate,
W: He sang so sweet and wild.
W: And with his song he stole away,
W: The master’s only child.
W: 
W: Oh she cast away her silken gown,
W: She cast away her pride;
W: And ran with him into the night,
W: Down to the sea so wild.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: Sit once more by a round fireside,
W: With your head upon my knee!
W: 
W: Oh I’d rather live an hour here,
W: Than seven long years with thee.
W: And feel the salt spray on my cheek,
W: And know that I am free.
W: 
W: Oh she danced in the wind and she danced in the rain,
W: on the edge of the cliffs and the shore!
W: And she tasted the salt upon her cheek,
W: And never came home no more!
W: 
W: Till ... a babe was born on a summers morn,
W: He was his parents joy.
W: His mother held him to her heart,
W: Her precious gypsy boy.
W: 
W: She took him to her fathers house,
W: She beat upon the gate.
W: Crying, ‘come and see my darling babe,
W: We named him for your sake’.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: And the father of that darlin' babe
W: Shall be a son to me.
W: 
W: They danced all the day and they danced all the night.
W: And they danced on the cliffs and the shore.
W: And the master held his grandchild tight,
W: And ne’er was alone no more.

W: My young love said to me,
W: "My mother won't mind,
W: And my father won't slight you,
W: for your lack of kind"
W: And she laid her hand on me,
W: and this she did say,
W: "Oh, it will not be long, love,
W: till our wedding-day"
W: 
W: And she went away from me,
W: and moved through the fair,
W: And fondly I watched her,
W: move here, and move there,
W: And then she went onward,
W: just one star awake,
W: Like the swan in the evening,
W: moves over the lake.
W: 
W: Last night she came to me,
W: my dead love came in,
W: So softly she came,
W: that her feet made no din,
W: And she laid her hand on me,
W: and this she did say,
W: "Oh, it will not be long, love,
W: till our wedding-day".

W: "A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better
W: He fairly won my heart; he wrote me a letter
W: With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever
W: And if I were with my love, I would live forever
W: 
W: "O, where is my love gone, with his cheeks like roses?
W: He is gone across the sea, gathering primroses
W: I'm afraid the shining sun might burn and scorch his beauty
W: And if I were with my love, I would do my duty
W: 
W: "Strange news is a-come to town, strange news is a-carried
W: Strange news flies up and down that my love is a-married
W: O, I wish them both much joy, though they don't hear me
W: And if I were with my love, I would do my duty
W: 
W: "O, what did you promise me when you lay beside me?
W: You said you'd marry me, and not deny me."
W: "If I said I'd marry you, 'twas only to try you
W: So bring your witness, love, and I'll not deny you."
W: 
W: "O, witness have I none save God Almighty
W: And may He reward you well for the slighting of me."
W: Her lips grew pale and wan; it made her poor heart tremble
W: For to think she had loved one, and he proved deceitful
W: 
W: A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better
W: He fairly won my heart; he wrote me a letter
W: With his hammer in his hand, he looked so clever

W: Come wander quietly and listen to the wind
W: Come here and listen to the sky
W: Come walking high above the rolling of the sea
W: And watch the swallows as they fly
W: And watch the swallows as they fly
W: 
W: There is no sorrow like the murmur of their wings
W: There is no choir like their song
W: There is no power like the freedom of their flight
W: While the swallows roam alone
W: While the swallows roam alone

W: Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?
W: Do you hear the swallows when they've flown?

W: And will some loving ease your pain
W: And will the silence strike confusion from your soul
W: And will the swallows come again?
W: And will the swallows come again?

W: [Verse 1]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young girl calling
W: Michael they are taking you away
W: For you stole Trevelyans corn
W: So the young might see the morn
W: Now a prison ship lay waiting in the bay
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young man calling
W: Nothing matters Mary when you're free
W: Against the famine and the crown
W: I rebelled they cut me down
W: Now you must raise our child with dignity
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: By a lonely harbour wall
W: She watched the last star falling
W: As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
W: For she lives to hope and pray
W: For her love in Botany bay
W: It's so lonely around the fields of Athenry

W: Sonny lives on a farm, in a wide open space
W: Take off your shoes, stay out of the race
W: Lay down your head, on a soft river bed
W: Sonny always remembers the words Mamma says.
W: 
W: Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone
W: Your Daddy's a sailor, never comes home,
W: Nights are so long, silence goes on,
W: I'm feeling so tired and not all that strong.
W: 
W: Sonny works on the land, though he's barely a man
W: There's not much to do but he does what he can
W: Sits by his window in his room by the stairs
W: Watching the waves drifting soft on the pier.

W: By chance it was I met my love
W: It did me much surprise
W: Down by a shady myrtle grove
W: Just as the sun did rise
W: The birds they sang right gloriously
W: And pleasant was the air
W: And there was none save she and I
W: Among the flowers fair
W: 
W: In dewy grass and green we walked
W: She timid was and coy
W: How can'st thou choose but pity me
W: My pretty pearl, my joy
W: How comes it that thou stroll this way?
W: Sweet maiden tell me true
W: Before bright Phoebus' glittering ray
W: Has supped the morning dew?
W: 
W: I go to tend the flocks I love
W: The ewes and tender lambs
W: That pasture by the myrtle grove
W: That gambol by their dams
W: There I enjoy a pure content
W: At dawning of the day
W: Then, hand in hand, we lovers went
W: To see the flock at play
W: 
W: And as we wended down the road
W: I said to her, "Sweet maid
W: Three years I in my place abode
W: And three more must be stayed
W: The three that I am bound so fast
W: O fairest wait for me
W: And when the weary years are past
W: Then wedded we will be."
W: 
W: "Three years are long, three times too long
W: Too lengthy the delay"
W: And then I answered in my song
W: "Hope wastes them quick away
W: Where love is fervent, fain and fast
W: And knoweth not decay
W: There nimbly fleet the seasons past
W: Accounted as one day."

W: Harking is bonnie and there lives my love

W: It will not remove oh for all that I have done
W: Oh I never will forget my love Anachie
W: For Anachie Gordon, he's bonnie and he's rough
W: He'd entice any woman that ever he saw
W: He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
W: Oh I never will forget my love Anachie
W: 
W: Down came her father and he's standing by the door
W: Saying Jeannie you're trying the tricks of a whore
W: You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
W: You must marry Lord Salton and leave Anachie
W: For Anachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
W: Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?
W: Oh the Sulton's lands are broad and his towers they run high
W: You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie
W: 
W: With Anachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread
W: And before I'll marry Sulton it's gold to my head
W: With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee
W: And I'll die if I don't get me love Anachie
W: And you that are my parents to church you may me bring
W: But unto Lord Sulton I'll never bear a son
W: To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee
W: And I'll die if I don't get me love  Anachie
W: 
W: Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home
W: And when she and her maidens so merry should have been
W: When she and her maidens so merry should have been
W: She went into her chambers she cried all alone
W: Come to bed now Jeannie me honey and my sweet
W: For to style you my mistress it would be so sweet
W: Be it mistress or Jeannie it's all the same to me
W: But in your bed Lord Sulton I never will lie
W: 
W: And down came her father and he's spoken with reknown
W: Saying you that are her maidens go loosen off her gowns
W: But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee
W: Saying father look I'm dying for me love Anachie
W: 
W: The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
W: And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide
W: And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
W: Saying oh it's been so long you've spent so long on the sands
W: Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood
W: They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead
W: 
W: You that are her maidens go take me by the hand
W: And take me to the chamber that me love she lies in
W: And he's kissed her cold lips till his heart has turned to stone
W: And he's died in the chamber that his love she lies in

W: Come me own one, come me fair one, come now unto me
W: Could you fancy a poor sailor lad, Who has just come from sea?
W: 
W: You are ragged love, you are dirty love, and your clothes smell much of tar
W: So begone you saucy sailor lad, so begone you Jack Tar
W: 
W: If I am ragged love, and I'm dirty love, and me clothes smell much of tar
W: I have silver in me pocket love, and gold in great store
W: 
W: And then when she heard him say so on her bended knee she fell
W: I will marry my dear Henry for I love a sailor lad so well
W: 
W: you think that I am foolish love, you think that I am mad?
W: For to wed with a poor country girl, Where no fortune's to be had
W: 
W: I will cross the briny ocean, I will whistle and sing
W: And since you have refused me offer love, some other girl shall wear the ring
W: 
W: I am frolicsome, and I am easy, good tempered and free
W: And I don't give a single pin me boys, What the world thinks of me

W: [Verse 1]
W: Near Banbridge Town in the County Down
W: One morning last July
W: Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
W: And she smiled as she passed me by
W: She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
W: To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
W: Such a winsome elf, I'm ashamed of myself
W: For to see I was staring there
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: [Verse 2]
W: As she onward sped, sure I scratched me head
W: And I looked with a feelin' rare
W: And I says, says I, to a passer-by
W: "Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair"?
W: Well, he looked at me and he said to me:
W: "That's the gem of Ireland's crown
W: Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
W: She's the star of the County Down"
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: She'd soft brown eyes with a look so shy
W: And a smile like the rose in June
W: And she sang so sweet what a lovely treat
W: As she lilted an Irish tune
W: At the Lammas dance I was in the trance
W: As she whirled with the lads of the town
W: And it broke me heart just to be apart
W: From the star of the County Down
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
W: So I'll dress in me Sunday clothes
W: With me shoes shone bright and me hat cocked right
W: For a smile from the nut brown rose
W: No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
W: Till my plough is a rust colored brown
W: And a smiling bride by me own fireside
W: Sits the star of the County Down

W: 
W: Well away my love away,
W: For we’re sailing home today
W: On a boat called memory
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: Oh she’s like some Persian queen,
W: With her opal robes serene
W: In the lamplight shimmering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: On a blue jay morning
W: Feathering thorny memories
W: Hail home, hearts have been too long away
W: On a well-worn byway travelling
W: Magpie gathering
W: Farewell queen of waters
W: 
W: Well it’s hard to roll in mirth,
W: When your feet don’t touch the earth
W: And the wolf comes hungering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: Folly never foots the bill
W: And we all shall pay in full
W: For a love of melody
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Well I should have sowed my corn,
W: But I danced until the dawn
W: Like an ant grass - hoppering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: 
W: Well there must be better ways
W: For to keep their debts at bay
W: And the whisky trickling
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: So we’ll bid our ship adieu
W: There’s a mooring in the blue
W: Where the gulls are gathering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: Oh she’s like some Persian queen,
W: And her like shall ne’er be seen
W: Only in our reverie
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: My song for you this evening, it's not to make you sad
W: Nor for adding to the sorrows of our troubled northern land
W: But lately I've been thinking and it just won't leave my mind
W: I'll tell you of two friends one time who were both good friends of mine
W: 
W: Isaac he was Protestant and Sean was Catholic born
W: But it never made a difference, for the friendship it was strong
W: And sometimes in the evening when we heard the sound of drums
W: We said it won't divide us, we will always be as one
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: It was on a Sunday morning when the awful news came round
W: 
W: Another killing had been done just outside Newry Town
W: We knew that Isaac danced up there, we knew he liked the band
W: But when we heard that he was dead we just could not understand
W: Now fear it filled the countryside there was fear in every home
W: When late at night a car came prowling round the Ryan Road
W: A Catholic would be killed tonight to even up the score
W: Oh Christ it's young McDonald they have taken from the door
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: I don't know where the moral is or where this song should end
W: But I wonder just how many wars are fought between good friends
W: And those who give the orders are not the ones to die
W: It's Scott and young McDonald and the likes of you and I
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together

W: Verse 1
W: 
W: Well how do you do, young Willie McBride?
W: you mind if I sit here down by your graveside?
W: And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
W: I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
W: I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen,
W: When you joined the great fallen in 1916,
W: I hope you died well and I hope you died clean,
W: Or young Willie McBride, was it slow and obscene?
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Did they beat the drum slowly? Did they play the fife lowly?
W: Did they sound the death march, as they lowered you down?
W: Did the band play the Last Post and chorus?
W: Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: 
W: Did you leave ere a wife or a sweetheart behind?
W: In some faithful heart is your memory enshrined?
W: Although you died back in 1916,
W: In that faithful heart are you forever nineteen?
W: Or are you a stranger without even a name?
W: Enclosed in forever behind a glass frame,
W: In an old photograph all torn battered and stained,
W: And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame.
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: 
W: The sun now it shines on the green fields of France,
W: There's a warm summer breeze that makes the red poppies dance,
W: And look how the sun shines from under a cloud,
W: There's no gas, no barbed wire, there's no gun firing now.
W: But here in this graveyard it's still "No Man's Land",
W: The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand,
W: To man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
W: To a whole generation that were butchered and damned.
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 4
W: 
W: Ah, young Willie McBride I can't help wonder why,
W: those that lie here know why did they die?
W: And did they believe when they answered the call?
W: Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
W: Well, the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain,
W: The killing and dying were all done in vain,
W: For young Willie McBride it all happened again,
W: And again, and again, and again, and again.
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Did they beat the drum slowly? Did they play the fife lowly?
W: Did they sound the death march, as they lowered you down?
W: Did the band play the Last Post and chorus?
W: And did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?

W: 
W: If life is a river and your heart is a boat
W: And just like a water baby, baby born to float
W: And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
W: And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
W: 'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
W: Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
W: And we stack all the dead men in self-addressed crates
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day
W: When fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
W: And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
W: Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
W: Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: And heaven has its way
W: When all will harmonise
W: And know it's in our hearts
W: The dream will realise
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes

W: In these last few days I've been afraid
W: That I might drift away
W: 
W: So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
W: That make me think about where I came from
W: And that's the reason why I seem
W: So far away today
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Oh and I have moved and I've kept on moving
W: Proved the points that I needed proving
W: Lost the friends that I needed losing
W: Found others on the way
W: 
W: Oh and I have tried and kept on trying
W: Stolen dreams yes there's no denying
W: I have traveled far with conscience flying
W: Somewhere with the wind
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Now I'm sitting here before the fire
W: The empty room, the forest choir
W: The flames that could not get any higher
W: They've withered now they've gone
W: 
W: But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
W: And I know what I will do tomorrow
W: When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow
W: Then I will disappear
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time

W: Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
W: Soar Black Head against the sky
W: Between the rocks that run down to the sea
W: 
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
W: Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
W: 
W: Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
W: Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
W: 
W: Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
W: Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: 
W: Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
W: Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
W: Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: 
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

W: They first appear and then they’re gone
W: 
W: They’ll tell to you some loving story
W: And they’ll make you think that they love you well
W: And away they’ll go and court some other
W: And leave you there in grief to dwell
W: 
W: I wish I was on some tall mountain
W: Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
W: I’d write a letter to my false true lover
W: Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
W: 
W: I wish I was a little sparrow
W: And I had wings to fly so high
W: I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
W: And when he’d ask, I would deny
W: 
W: Oh love is handsome, love is charming
W: And love is pretty while it’s new
W: But love grows cold as love grows older
W: And fades away like morning dew

W: And nestling together in a fine feather bed
W: So give me too shoes with buckles of red
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The maid hid the shoes in the back of her waist,
W: She praised his good cobbling and shoemakers taste
W: And home to her father, she mournfully faced
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O father oh father I have got me a man
W: And he is the one I would web if I can
W: As handsome as ever in leather did stand
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Her father was thinking and thinking again
W: For to wed her to riches and have them for him
W: Who knows but it might be a prince or a king,
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: Who knows that it might be a jobber from town,
W: Or a wealthy sea captain who sails the world round?
W: A man with some thousands and thousands of pounds
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: So the father was smiling the daughter embraced,
W: And touching the buckles he drew back in haste
W: He spied the red shoes that were tied round her waist
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O daughter o daughter he started to shout,
W: When he did discover what she was about
W: God knows it was one but that old cobbling clout.
W: That she met in the morning early

V:1 
W: 
W: When I was a fair maid about seventeen
W: I listed in the navy, for to serve the Queen
W: I listed in the navy, a sailor lad to stand
W: For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
W: And the music so grand, and the music so grand
W: For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
W: 
W: Well, the officer that listed me was a tall and handsome man
W: He said, "You'll make a sailor, so come along, my man"
W: My waist being tall and slender, my fingers long and thin
W: Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
W: I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them
W: Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
W: 
W: Well, they sent me to bed and they sent me to bunk
W: To lie with a sailor, I never was afraid
W: But taking off my blue coat, it oft times made me smile
W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
W: And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while
W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
W: 
W: Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower
W: And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour
W: But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid
W: Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
W: My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed
W: Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
W: 
W: Well, the captain, he came up to me and he asked if this was so
W: Oh I dare not, I dare not, I dare not say no
W: "It's a pity we should lose you, such a sailor lad you made
W: It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid
W: A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid
W: It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid"
W: 
W: So it's fare thee well, captain, you've been so kind to me
W: And likewise, my shipmates, I'm sorry to part with thee
W: But if ever the navy needs a lad, a sailor I'll remain
W: I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
W: And I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again
W: I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again

W: Well you walk into a city street, you could be in Po ru
W: And you hear a distant calling and you know it's ment for you,
W: And you drop what you were doing and you join the merry mob,
W: And before you know just where you are, your in an Irish pub.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: They've got one in Holalulu they've got one in Moscow too,
W: They got four of them in Sydney and a couple in Katmando
W: So wheather you sing or pull a pint you'll always have a job,
W: 'Cause where ever you go around the world you'll find an Irish pub.
W: 
W: Now that design is fairly simple and it usually works the same,
W: You'll have ''Razor Houghton'' scoring in the Ireland - England game
W: And you know your in an Irish pub the minute you're in the door,
W: For a couple of boys with bodhrans will be murdering Christy Moore.
W: 
W: They've got one in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,
W: They got four of them in Sydney and a couple in Kathmandu
W: So whether you sing or pull a pint you'll always have a job,
W: 'Cause where ever you go around the world you'll find an Irish pub.
W: 
W: Now the owner is Norwegian and the manager comes from Cork,
W: And the lad that's holding up the bar says 'Only Eejits Work'
W: He was born and bred in Bolton but his mammy's from Kildare,
W: And he's going to make his fortune soon and move to County Clare.
W: 
W: They've got one in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,

W: So I'll leave ye sitting at the bar and face the wind and rain,
W: For I'll have that pint you owe me, if I'm not gone on the dry,
W: When we meet next week in Frankford in the fields of Athenry.
W: 
W: They've got one in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,

W: Come rise up my fellows with the best of good will
W: Your horses need something their bellies to fill

W: When four o'colock comes, me boys, it's up we do rise
W: And off to the stables we merrily flies
W: With a-rubbin' and scrubbin' our horses we'll go

W: 
W: When six o' clock comes, me boys, at breakfast we'll meet
W: And cold beef and pork we'll heartily eat
W: With a piece in our pockets, to the fields we do go
W: For we're all jolly fellows that follows the plough
W: The farmer and this he did say
W: What have you been doing this long summer's day?
W: You've not ploughed your acre, I'll swear and I'll vow
W: You are all lazy fellows that follows the plough!
W: 
W: Then up spoke our carter and this he did cry
W: We have all ploughed our acre you tell us a lie
W: We've all ploughed our acre, I'll swear and I'll vow
W: We are all jolly fellows that follows the plough
W: 
W: Then up spoke the farmer and laughed at the joke
W: Oh it's gone half past two boys it's time to unyoke
W: Unharness your horses and rub them down well
W: And I'll give you a jug of my very best ale
W: 
W: So come all you young ploughboys
W: Where e're you may be
W: Come take this advice and be ruled by me
W: Never fear any master where e're you may go
W: For we're all jolly fellows that follows the plough

T: My Old Kentucky Home
C:Stephen Foster
B: songs
B: traditional songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: "My Old Kentucky Home," originally titled "Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night!," is the state song of Kentucky.
W: 
W: The facts surrounding the composition of this song point to the influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin rather than a visit to Kentucky. Foster may or may not have visited his cousins in Bardstown, Kentucky at their mansion Federal Hill, but the original sketch of this song, dating from 1852, substitutes "Poor Uncle Tom" for "My Old Kentucky Home" and aligns Foster's sympathies with the Abolitionist movement.
W: =========================
W: 
W: Verse 1:
W: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
W: ‘Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
W: The corn-top’s ripe and the meadow’s in the bloom,
W: While the birds make music all the day.
W: The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
W: All merry, all happy and bright;
W: By ‘n’ by Hard Times comes a-knocking at the door,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Weep no more my lady
W: Oh! weep no more today!
W: We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,
W: For the Old Kentucky Home far away.
W: 
W: Verse 2:
W: They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
W: On meadow, the hill and the shore,
W: They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
W: On the bench by the old cabin door.
W: The day goes by like a shadow o’er the heart,
W: With sorrow, where all was delight,
W: The time has come when the darkies have to part,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3:
W: The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
W: Wherever the darky may go;
W: A few more days, and the trouble all will end,
W: In the field where the sugar-canes grow;
W: A few more days for to tote the weary load,
W: No matter, ’twill never be light;
W: A few more days till we totter on the road,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus

W: 
W: With my tiddy-right-fol-da-liddle-dido

W: 
W: "Oh how can I get to your chamber, love?

W: "Oh go and get the ladder, love

W: With dreams running through her head
W: "I'll lay on me life," said the gay old wife
W: There's a boy in me daughter's bed"
W: 
W: Then up the stairs the old man crept
W: And into the room did steal
W: Silence reigned where the daughter slept
W: And he never twigged the creel
W: 
W: "My curse attend you, father
W: What brought you up so soon?
W: To put me through my evening prayers
W: And I just lying down?"
W: 
W: He went back to his gay old wife
W: He went back to she
W: "She has the prayer book in her hand
W: And she's praying for you and me"
W: 
W: No peace nor ease could that old wife get
W: 'Til she would rise and see
W: She came on a stumbling-block
W: And into the creel went she
W: 
W: "Oh high I rocked her, oh I rocked her
W: Didn't I rock her well?
W: For if any old wife begrudge me her daughter
W: I'll rock her into hell"

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Young Roger the miller came courting of late
W: To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate
W: She had for her fortune a many fine things
W: Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings
W: Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground
W: She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds
W: 
W: Then the money and supper, they both were laid down
W: Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds
W: The sight of that money and beauty likewise
W: Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes
W: "Now that your daughter and money is here
W: 'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"
W: 
W: Then the money and supper were taken from sight
W: And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight
W: Roger was taken and shown out the door
W: And ordered not for to come there anymore
W: 'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair
W: Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"
W: 
W: Now it was when six months, they were over and past
W: And Roger the miller, he met with his lass
W: "I think I do know you then, madam," said he
W: "I am the same way with you, sir," said she
W: "A man with your features with fine yellow hair
W: Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"
W: 
W: "Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came
W: But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name
W: I thought that your father would never dispute
W: To give me the gray mare with you to boot
W: And not to risk lose such a dutiful son
W: Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"
W: 
W: "For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard
W: For there's plenty of men in this town to be had
W: If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see
W: But now you have neither the gray mare nor me
W: The price of that mare, it was never so great
W: Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"
W: 
W: Now Roger's away to his desolate home
W: And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone
W: Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay
W: She has wed a young miller who works the long day
W: Lads, when you're courting, be always aware
W: To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare

W: One fine winter's morn my horn I did blow
W: To the green fields of Keady for hours we did go
W: We gathered our dogs and we circled around
W: For none loves the sport better than the boys in the dell.
W: 
W: And when we arrived they were all standing there
W: We set off for the fields, boys, in search of a hare
W: We didn't get far till someone gave the cheer
W: Over high hills and valleys the sweet puss did steer
W: 
W: As we flew o'er the hills, 'twas a beautiful sight
W: There was dogs black and yellow, there was dogs black and white
W: As she took the black bank for to try them once more
W: Oh it was her last look o'er the hills of Greenmore.
W: 
W: In a field of wheat stubble this pussy did lie
W: And Rory and Charmer they did pass her by
W: And there where we stood at the top of the brae
W: We heard the last words that this sweet puss did say:
W: 
W: No more o'er the green fields of Keady I'll roam
W: Nor trip through the fields, boys, in sport and in fun
W: Or hear the long horn that your toner does play
W: I'll go home to my den by the clear light of day.
W: 
W: You may blame ol' MacMahon for killing the hare
W: For he's at his ol' capers this many's a year
W: On Saturday and Sunday he never gives o'er
W: With a pack of strange dogs round the hills of Greenmore

W: When I was at home I was merry and frisky,
W: My dad kept a pig and my mother sold whisky,
W: My uncle was rich, but never would by aisey
W: Till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey.
W: Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey,
W: My dear little Shelah, I thought would run crazy,
W: When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey.
W: 
W: I marched from Kilkenny, and, as I was thinking
W: On Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking,
W: But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,
W: For fear of a drubbing from Corporal Casey.
W: Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey!
W: The devil go with him, I ne'er could be lazy,
W: He struck my shirts so, ould Corporal Casey.
W: 
W: We went into battle, I took the blows fairly
W: That fell on my pate, but they bothered me rarely,

W: Down between two rigs of rye, I heard to lovers talking

W: But before I’ve a word or two to say, if you’ve a mind for to tarry
W: 
W: Of you your father he takes good care and your mother too
W: She combs down your yellow hair
W: And your sisters too says you’ll get no share if you follow me love, a stranger
W: 
W: He said “Lassie Lassie your fortune it is but small and perhaps its true that you have none at all
W: And I’m not a match love for you at all, so go and give your love to another
W: 
W: Oh my father can fret and my mother can frown and my sisters too I do disown
W: And if they were dead and below the ground I’d still follow you love, you’re no Stanger
W: 
W: But this Lassie’s courage began to fade, and her rosie cheeks they soon grew worn and pale
W: And the tears came trickling down like hail or a heavy shower in summer
W: 
W: And he’s taken her kerchief of linen so fine and he’s kissed her lips and then he’s dried her eyes
W: Saying weep no more love, for you shall be mine and all that I said was to try you
W: 
W: And this laddie was of courage bold a gallant chief just 19 years old
W: And he’s made the hills and the valleys to roam and the young bonnie lass ahs gone with him

W: And they live in Breechen the winter through, aye, and in the Montrose in the summer

W: She's gone to be wed to another.

W: The next time I say her she was seated down neat
W: I sat down beside her not a bite could I eat
W: For I thought my love's company far better than meat
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.
W: 
W: The last time I saw her she was all dressed in white
W: And the more I gazed on her she dazzled my sight
W: I lifted my hat and I bade her goodnight

W: But now she's rewarded me to the last day
W: She's gone to be wed to another.

W: So dig me a grave and dig it down deep
W: And strew it all over with primrose so sweet
W: And lay me down easy for no more to weep
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.

W: Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
W: Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
W: The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
W: Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
W: The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
W: My love he wooed me as I lie there
W: With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy
W: Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush
W: 
W: When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom
W: The blackberry blossom was white as the snow
W: But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses
W: And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow
W: The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon
W: Known for his cackling and his screaming
W: Driving away the swallow and the thrush
W: From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush
W: 
W: I was picking berries when that crow flew above me
W: Carrying my lover so far away
W: Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom
W: By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay
W: The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard
W: With weeds growing over in the old graveyard
W: And the day settles down to an evening hush
W: Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush

"Am"z1z1z1z1"G"z1z1z1z1|
W: Well I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been
W: For three score years in this little isle of green
W: I'm known along the Liffy from the Basin to the Zoo
W: And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
W: For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
W: He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
W: But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo
W: 
W: I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn
W: A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn
W: There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
W: And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo
W: 
W: Who did I waken but the woman of the house
W: With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
W: She began to frighten and I said boo
W: Sure, don't be afraid at all, it's only Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: I met a little girl while a walkin out one day
W: Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say
W: Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
W: With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo
W: 
W: I'll buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
W: And a nice young lady I'll go courting by and by
W: I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them with blue
W: And an old fashioned lady I will make her too
W: 
W: So all along the high road with my bag upon my back
W: Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
W: With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
W: Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo
W: 
W: O I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
W: The fire is all raked and now tis out of light
W: For now you've heard the story of my auld rigadoo
W: So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu

W: It was on one bright March morning
W: I bid New Orleans adieu.
W: And I took the road to Jackson town,
W: My fortune to renew,
W: I cursed all foreign money,
W: No credit could I gain,
W: Which filled my heart with longing for
W: The lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I stepped on board a railroad car,
W: Beneath the morning sun,
W: I road the roads till evening,
W: And I laid me down again,
W: All strangers there no friends to me,
W: Till a dark girl towards me came,
W: And I fell in love with a Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I said, "My pretty Creole girl,
W: My money here's no good,
W: But if it weren't for the alligators,
W: I'd sleep out in the wood".
W: "You're welcome here kind stranger,
W: Our house is very plain.
W: But we never turn a stranger out,
W: From the lakes of Pontchartrain."
W: 
W: She took me into her mammy's house,
W: And treated me quite well,
W: The hair upon her shoulder
W: In jet black ringlets fell.
W: To try and paint her beauty,
W: I'm sure it would be in vain,
W: So handsome was my Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I asked her if she'd marry me,
W: She said it could never be,
W: For she had got another,
W: And he was far at sea.
W: She said that she would wait for him
W: And true she would remain.
W: Till he returned for his Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: So fare thee well my Creole girl,
W: I never will see you no more,
W: But I'll ne'er forget your kindness
W: In the cottage by the shore.
W: And at each social gathering
W: A flowing glass I'll raise,
W: And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl,
W: And the lakes of Pontchartrain.

W: Shaking hands and fingers that do tremble
W: Soldier's joy has been a bitter pill
W: Though in battle a brave man I resemble
W: Alone, I am a coward without will
W: 
W: Here's McGee from the great state of Missouri
W: To the ?Show-Me State Militia? I belong
W: And to judge from the pride on the Confederate side
W: I'd say five hundred thousand rebels can't be wrong
W: 
W: A rebel stand is no place for a traitor
W: A loveless union cannot bend us to her will
W: Cannot command the soldiers who now hate her
W: Nor demand a bounty of her generals
W: 
W: I took a rifle ball in my shoulder
W: But my entire body filled with pain
W: I waited with them all at the field hospital
W: Oh God, another shot of morphine
W: 
W: Soldier's joy, oh, what's the point in pleasure
W: When it's only meant to kill the pain?
W: Lay down my arms and take the coffin's measure
W: Or take up arms and send me out to fight again
W: 
W: Shaking hands, was I a coward, was I brave?
W: Shaking hands, I took the bitter pill
W: Tell the story on my grave, my soul they could not save
W: What the bullet could not kill, the needle will

W: Father, dear father, if you see fit
W: We'll send him to college for one year yet
W: I'll tie blue ribbons all around his head
W: To let the maidens know that he's married
W: 
W: One day, I was looking o'er my father's castle wall
W: I spied all the boys aplaying with the ball
W: My own true love was the flower of them all
W: He's young but he's daily growing
W: 
W: At the age of fourteen, he was a married man
W: At the age of fifteen, the father of a son
W: At the age of sixteen, his grave it was green
W: And death had put an end to his growing

W: There was a Wild Colonial Boy, Jack Duggan was his name
W: He was born and raised in Ireland, in a place called Castlemain
W: He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
W: And dearly did his parents love, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: At the early age of eighteen years, he left his native home
W: And to Australia's sunny shore, he was inclined to roam
W: He robbed the rich, to help the poor, he shot Judge McEvoy
W: A terror to Australia was, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: One morning on the prairie, as Jack he rode along
W: A listening to the mocking bird, singing a cheerful song
W: Up rode three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
W: They all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: Surrender now, Jack Duggan, for you see we're three to one
W: Surrender in the Queen's high name, you are a plundering son
W: Jack drew two pistols from his belt and proudly waved them high
W: "I'll fight but not surrender, " said the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
W: And turning round to Davis, he received a mortal wound
W: A bullet pierced his proud young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy
W: And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy

W: There once was a ship that put to sea
W: And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
W: The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
W: Blow, me bully boys, blow
W: 
W: Soon may the Wellerman come
W: To bring us sugar and tea and rum
W: One day, when the tonguing' is done
W: We'll take our leave and go
W: 
W: She had not been two weeks from shore
W: When down on her a right whale bore
W: The captain called all hands and swore
W: He'd take that whale in tow ...
W: 
W: Before the boat had hit the water
W: The whale's tail came up and caught her
W: All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
W: When she dived down below ...
W: 
W: No line was cut, no whale was freed
W: And the captain's mind was not on greed
W: But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
W: She took that ship in tow ) ...
W: 
W: For forty days or even more
W: The line went slack then tight once more
W: All boats were lost, there were only four
W: And still that whale did go ...
W: 
W: As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
W: The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
W: The Wellerman makes his regular call
W: To encourage the captain, crew and all
W: 
W: Soon may the Wellerman come
W: To bring us sugar and tea and rum
W: One day, when the tonguing' is done
W: We'll take our leave and go

W: Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
W: From glen to glen, and down the mountain side,
W: The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
W: It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.
W: But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
W: Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
W: It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
W: Oh, Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so!
W: 
W: But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
W: If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
W: Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,
W: And kneel and say an Ave there for me;
W: And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
W: And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
W: For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
W: And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!

W: across the ocean wild and wide
W: to where your heart has ever been
W: since first you were my bonny bride
W: The roses all have left your cheeks
W: I watched them fade away and die
W: You voice is sad whene're you speak
W: and tears bedim your loving eyes
W: So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again
W: 
W: I know you love me Kathleen dear
W: your heart was ever fond and true
W: I always feel when you are near
W: That life holds nothing dear but you
W: the smiles that once you gave to me
W: I scarcely ever see them now
W: the many, many times I see
W: a darkening shadow on your brow
W: Oh So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again
W: 
W: To that dear home beyond the sea
W: My Kathleen shall again return
W: And when thy old friends welcome thee
W: Thy loving heart will cease to yearn
W: Where laughs the little silver stream
W: beside your mother's humble cot
W: and brightest rays of sunshine gleam
W: To where your grief will be forgot
W: so So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again

W: An old man gazed on a photograph
W: In a locket he'd worn for years;
W: His nephew then asked him the reason why
W: That picture had caused him tears.
W: "Come listen," he said, "I will tell you, lad,
W: A story that's strange, but true!
W: Your father and I, at the school one day,
W: Met two little girls in blue.
W: That picture is one of those girls," he said
W: And to me she was once a wife;
W: I thought her unfaithful, we quarrelled lad,
W: And parted that night for life.
W: My fancy of jealousy wronged a heart,
W: A heart that was good and true -
W: For two better girls never lived than they,
W: Those two little girls in blue."
W: 
W: Refrain
W: 
W: Two little girls in blue, lad,
W: Two little girls in blue.
W: They were sisters, we were brothers
W: And learned to love the two.
W: And one little girl in blue, lad,
W: Who won your father's heart,
W: Became your mother. I married the other,
W: And now we have drifted apart.

W: Verse 1
W: I wander'd today to the hill, Maggie,
W: To watch the scene below;
W: The creek and the old rusty mill, Maggie,
W: Where we sat in the long, long ago.
W: The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie,
W: Where first the daisies sprung;
W: The creaking old mill is still, Maggie,
W: Since you and I were young.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: And now we are aged and gray, Maggie,
W: And the trials of life nearly done;
W: But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie,
W: When you and I were young.
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: A city so silent and lone, Maggie,
W: Where the young and the gay and the best,
W: In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie,
W: Have each found a place of rest,
W: Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie,
W: And join in the songs that were sung;
W: For we sang as gay as they, Maggie,
W: When you and I were young.
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: They say I am feeble with age, Maggie,
W: My steps are less sprightly than then;
W: My face is a well-written page, Maggie,
W: But time alone was the pen.
W: They say we are aged and gray, Maggie,
W: As spray by the white breakers flung;
W: But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
W: When you and I were young.

W: Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
W: Under the shade of a Coolibah tree
W: And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled
W: "You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong
W: Up jumped the swagging and grabbed him with glee
W: And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag
W: "You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me
W: And he sang as he stowed that jumbuck in his tucker bag
W: "You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Down came the squatter mounted on his thorough-bred
W: Up came the troopers one, two, three
W: "Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me
W: "Whose that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker-bag?
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Up cut the swagging and jumped into the billabong
W: "You'll never catch me alive" said he
W: And his ghost may be heard if you pass by that billabong
W: "Who'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me?"
W: 
W: Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me
W: And his ghost may be heard if you pass by that billabong
W: "You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me"
W: 
W: Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
W: You'll come a Waltzing Matilda with me

W: I was standing by my window

W: For to carry my mother away.

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One Sunday morning as I went walking
W: By Brisbane waters I chanced to stray
W: I heard a prisoner his fate bewailing
W: As on the sunny river bank he lay
W: I am a native from Erin's island
W: Transported now from my native shore
W: They tore me from my aged parents
W: And from the maiden whom I adore
W: 
W: I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
W: At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie
W: At all those settlements I've woked in chains
W: But of all places of condemnation
W: And penal stations of New South Wales
W: Of Moreton Bay I have found no equal
W: Excessive tyranny each day prevails
W: For three long years I was beastly treated
W: And heavy irons on my legs I wore
W: My back from flogging was lacerated
W: And often slain with my crimson gore
W: And many a man from downright starvation
W: Lies mouldering underneath the clay
W: And Captain Logan he had us mangled
W: At the triangles in Moreton Bay
W: 
W: Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
W: We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
W: Till a native black lying there in ambush
W: Did give our tyrant his mortal stroke
W: My fellow prisoners exhilarated
W: That all such monsters a death shall find
W: And when from bondage we're liberated
W: Our former sufferings shall fade from mind

W: [Chorus:]
W: Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
W: Onward! the sailors cry;
W: Carry the lad that's born to be king
W: Over the sea to Skye.
W: 
W: 1. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
W: Thunderclaps rend the air;
W: Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,
W: Follow they will not dare.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: 2. Many's the lad, fought on that day
W: Well the claymore did wield;
W: When the night came, silently lay
W: Dead on Culloden's field.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: 3. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep,
W: Ocean's a royal bed.
W: Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
W: Watch by your weary head.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: 4. Burned are their homes, exile and death
W: Scatter the loyal men;
W: Yet ere the sword cool in the sheath
W: Charlie will come again.
