W: Serendipitous Collectors                            Charlotte Lyngbye
W: 
W: We are the collectors of precious things
W: Of cute little vase and fake gold earrings
W: Of all things that glitters, dazzles and shines
W: Of half broken mugs in pretty designs
W: 
W: Of interesting books that I never read
W: Of decorative cushions for the top of the bed
W: We are the Salvos and Vinnies brigade
W: At their doors at nine and ready to trade
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: This need it's growing inside of me
W: I prefer to call it serendipity
W: It sounds like a positive description
W: For what really is a nasty addiction
W: 
W: I am the early bird at every garage sale
W: I am the rooter through boxes where bargains prevail
W: I try to temper this need of mine
W: I must learn to learn to tow the minimal line
W: 
W: Before this collecting spins out of control
W: And leaves me in a cluttery hole
W: With every useless knickknack and every stupid tray
W: I get a little less free to enjoy the day
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: From under piles of stuff I will wonder
W: One day I'll be six feet under
W: Who'll deal my this junk at the end of the day
W: That builds up in my life and takes my freedom away

W: 
W: He knew all the tricks of the horse trade
W: His cinematic legend was well and truly made
W: The smartest horse in movies, he had no equal

W: 
W: It's Sunday, it's morning I wake from my sleep
W: Lethargic and lazy from the hours I keep
W: We're camped in the bush by the sesa and the sand
W: The Meaning of Leif is the name of my Van
W: 
W: I'm snoozy and whoozy and staying in bed
W: But there's a man with a hammer inside of my head
W: He's telling me last night I drank too much wine
W: But with six cups of tea I'll recover just fine
W: 
W: The Meaning of Leif is the name of my Van
W: Leif was my Dad, he was a lively old man
W: Sadly he passed a few years ago
W: He left me a little bit of money and so
W: I spent it to buy this old Van that I love
W: And I know Leif is watching from heaven above
W: 
W: So just as I slip away back to my dream
W: The arrival of the brain cell recovery team
W: A friend brings me pancakes through the caravan door
W: Just as I'm craving a pancake like never before
W: 
W: What blessing what joy to have such a friend
W: Who cooks breakfast to help me feel human again
W: Last night we got rowdy by the light of the moon
W: We stayed up all night singing tune after tune
W: 
W: Despite hangovers and headache it's a beautiful day
W: We love the freedom of getting away
W: Away from the phones and hustle of life
W: From work and the news of a world deep in strife

W: 
W: "Go away" he said "you're cramping my style"
W: It's a helluva way to ease me down
W: I just stared back up at him and faked a fake smile
W: I guess it's just as well I'm rid of this clown
W: 
W: He never floated my boat anyway
W: His charming veneer was way too blunt
W: It never felt right, like running down the highway
W: While wearing your shoes back to front
W: 
W: So I hold my head up high
W: It's just another stumble
W: Just another dent in my road
W: 
W: But the question still remains
W: After taking this tumble
W: Am I prepared to kiss another toad
W: 
W: So time to move on and forget about the hurt
W: It's not exactly the end of my world
W: To be dumped and discarded by a 1[st] class jerk
W: `Cos I'm no longer a timid little girl
W: 
W: No more wasting time on another dud lover
W: I would rather stick needles in my eyes
W: I'll hit the ground running and soon enough recover
W: I'll be dancing and reaching for the skies

W: At my desk committing hard to writing my first hit song
W: Waxing lyrical, concentration poised, then everything goes wrong	Repeat: Verse
W: 10 minutes in, my mojo goes and I can't write no more
W: The pool of my creative juice have spilt out on the floor
W: Chorus
W: No clever words or wit is forthcoming on the screen 	G / / / 	Gm / / /

W: 
W: 4 Bars on D as intro
W: 
W: I ask myself: what can I do to get composing flowing
W: Perhaps a glass of red or two will really get things going
W: Before long I'm half sloshed and my brain cells are misfiring	Verse
W: Unfocused and distracted, but I'm really bloody trying
W: 
W: I need to tap this vault of brilliance; I have no doubt I possess
W: Well maybe not that brilliant, more mediocre I confess	Verse
W: But all the stories hidden in there, a lifetime of experience
W: Opening my soul to provide some good material
W: 
W: CHORUS	Chorus
W: 
W: So this song is just another failed song that didn't make it
W: But in the end I'm happy to say, that I didn't have to fake it	Verse
W: It may never get me on MTV, or launch me into a star
W: But it has grit and it has guts, so I'm glad I came this far
W: 
W: The words came forth from deep within the very core of me
W: A product of persistence & frustrated energy	Verse
W: It came so fast when it finally came and I was smiling as I wrote it
W: I better come back next week, with my shot at another smash hit
W: 
W: Some cleverness and wit did come forth on my screen
W: Perhaps a mega hit song for the taking 	Chorus
W: I maybe even get to live a little dream
W: Not spend the rest of my days just faking

W: And happily shoot down a bunch of Indians
W: And after such a hard days work
W: One man tells the other
W: To get off his horse and drinks his milk - and everybody laughs
W: 
W: Meanwhile I'm sitting in the sun
W: With a view of a big blue Ocean,
W: Wishing I could freeze the beauty of this moment
W: It's such a peaceful day
W: And I'm hoping that the ocean
W: Is NOT one day gonna wash everything away
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: `Cos the world is going crazy
W: It's gone totally insane
W: We're caught between our pleasure and our pain
W: There'll be no super hero
W: No magic fairy friend
W: Who will wave his wand and make the it right again
W: 
W: Meanwhile somewhere else,
W: A man with a gun says
W: "Do you feel lucky punk",
W: While one by one
W: He snuffs the out the life of random strangers
W: Just because that's his idea of having fun.
W: 
W: Meanwhile here I am
W: Trying to reconcile
W: Why so many have so little and I so much
W: Since the day that I was born
W: Good luck has come my way
W: Yet it grinds on my conscience every day
W:

W: 
W: You're such a well-known quantity
W: But also a mystery
W: So wild and incredibly free
W: But always a good friend to me
W: Rough and ready as they come
W: Yet as sweet as a pie
W: You're the noise in my head
W: So loud that it blinds my eye
W: So loud that it blinds my eye
W: 
W: 
W: As you turn up your volume
W: Like some mad wild haired conductor
W: You almost blind yourself
W: Waving your ziggy too close to your eye
W: You're drunk and a bit out of control
W: And singing on the top of your voice
W: So crazy and so bold
W: You're cranking up the noise
W: You're cranking up the noise
W: 
W: I hope you find some peace
W: When you're in bed at night
W: Cos all I wish for you
W: Is that you will sleep real tight
W: 
W: I wonder should I leave and forego
W: The rest of your little side-show
W: Or should I stay and just observe
W: And allow your noise to hit my nerve
W: And trigger my insanity
W: And sense of curiosity
W: Cos you make me laugh and smile
W: And make me feel insane for a while
W: I'll be insane for a while
W: 
W: I hope you find some peace
W: When in your bed at night
W: Cos all I wish for you
W: Is that you will sleep real tight

W: 
W: I've laid awake since 4 am, I'm desperate for sleep
W: By 5am I've counted nearly 30,000 sheep
W: I may as well get up and get my early coffee fix
W: I ought to make some breakfast but who the hell can eat at 6?
W: 
W: I must be showered, dressed and ready at my work at 8
W: The boss has called a meeting, I'm already running late
W: I work all day just like a dog to generate some cash
W: Have hardly time to wash myself or for emptying the trash
W: 
W: I'd like to stop for coffee but there'a is no time left for me
W: Cos I have to take the car for rego twentyfive past 3
W: I'm all clean out of sleeping pills, I need to get some more
W: So I got to see the doctor, my appointment is at 4
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: My life is run like clockwork and it's messing with my head
W: I'd like to stop the time for once and take a break instead
W: But life is for the living, can't expect a rosy bed
W: To get some rest and peace I'll have to wait till I am dead
W: It's fine to keep a clock that helps you be somewhere at 2
W: But if you don't watch out the clock will end up keeping you
W: 
W: At 6 o'clock the phone rings, in the midst of cooking dinner
W: A telemarketeering wanker tells me I'm a winner
W: `Miss LINGBIE" says a foreign voice, we have a special offer
W: I throw the phone against the wall, what bullshit I must suffer
W: 
W: My dog has rolled in something that stinks to highest heaven
W: So now she needs a bath before my banjo class at 7
W: Just as I think I've got it made and finally back on track
W: I'd rather stay at home with cuppa tea and hit the sack
W: 
W: But off I go with Banjo case and drive into the night
W: I have to speed like crazy just to get there before eight
W: My banjo class was cancelled, I was never notified
W: I waited for 2 hours and went home at half past 9
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: I finally arrive back home and sit down with a wine
W: But not before I get three loads of washing off the line
W: At last I make it to my bed, lie down by half past 12
W: I am a slave to clockwork and it's proving living hell

W: The day you caught my eye and smiled
W: And I felt the heat
W: 
W: You tried to stay so cool
W: And so casual
W: It knocked me off my feet
W: 
W: `Cos I've seen that look before

W: It doesn't take a genious
W: To spot the telltale signs
W: 
W: Smeared all over your clothes
W: And stuck to your face

W: 
W: You don't have to speak the words
W: We're in the same place

W: `Cos I've seen that look before

W: My heartbeat is elevated and I go Red in the face
W: The ridiculous stumbling over words
W: that normally comes easy
W: And fumbling of hands and jerks in the body
W: What to say next
W: You wanna keep talking but afraid to sound too keen and
W: But it's a wasted excersise
W: Will there be a show of hands

W: As we place our lives and answers
W: at the hands of the incompetent

W: And you can only reap what you sow
W: We must settle our debts

W: The world is not your toy

W: Something will give one day

W: I only wish I knew the way

W: I wish that I could find relief
W: From this constant sense of doom

W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND                 By the fantabulous Deb Morgan
W: 
W: (Short off the cuff, spoken only...not read due to spelling of a certain word)
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND 1
W: 
W: High on the headland..an eagle sawed.............
W: ......a piece of 4 by two into small pieces so they could be
W: used to make a fire to keep its eaglets warm.
W: 
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND 2
W: 
W: High on the headland
W: I got high when I saw the sky
W: I then got low when I kicked my toe
W: And this started to throb so I drank some grog
W: And this did the trick but then I got sick
W: So I smoke some pot and I ate a lot
W: But that was ok because it was a craving eh?.....not a Craven A
W: High on a headland
W: I saw the sea winking at me
W: And I thought
W: No more weed for me
W: Except
W: I weed my pants
W: and  that was by chance
W: Cause I missed the loo
W: And am relieved it wasn't poo
W: Height isnt everything
W: But being really high
W: Has its benefits
W: I can touch the sky
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND                                      By Matthew Perry
W: 
W: Climbing high on the headland I remove my shoes...Then off with the socks...Toeland is revealed in all its glory, a thriving exuberant colony of freshly freed wiggling digits.
W: The nearby Footlands exist in relative harmony with their neighbor, Ankleland. A quiet vegetarian nation who nervously share a border with Calveland a place known for its flagrant disregard for animal rights in the wake of its booming veal industry.
W: Further up the Tibia Trail, Kneeland protrudes, a place known for over extending itself to the point of bankruptcy often requiring a full replacement.
W: Nearby Thighland, a very popular destination for Australian tourists which unfortunately is often linked to the notorious Crotchland. I move right along skirting notorious areas to avoid irritating certain crochety inhabitants.
W: Naval Land awaits, known to be home to mysterious covert actions and murky joint operations. Discouraged by somewhat aggressive signage... Danger Keep out! Live Ammunition! We make very very loud bangs! I  leave in search of more welcoming terrains.
W: I gladly clamber over the tiny republic of Sternumland and push on into the broad corrugations of Ribland the keepers of the Giant Chest.
W: I stop to take a breath as Neckland emerges from the clouds above. I take it on the Chinland and with not a Sherpa in sight I drag myself up the North Face. After regaining my breath I traverse the deep furrows of Browland and find my self in the legendary Follicle Forests of Scalpland. After a few hairy moments I stumble into a bald patch...And there to my amazement I find myself back...High on the Headland... It's a perfect day... Crystal clear with perfect 360 degree déjà vus!!!
W: 
W: Oh Fuck... Where did I leave my shoes???
W: 
W: High on the Headland                                        By Fiona Cullen
W: Bathed in it shimmering silvery light the water sparkles like a welcoming path from the island
W: Ancient rocky outcrops stand as sentinels protecting this grassy knoll
W: The ocean is like a giant lung breathing in and out in and out
W: My rock pools to the south my very special place of freedom, love and laughter where my spirit can soar
W: High on the headland encompass magnificent surrounds

W: Headland                                 By David Harris
W: High on the headland: not for the faint-hearted!
W: Nor my isthmus neck
W: Holding my level gaze, feet splayed
W: Eyes azimuth bound
W: Positioning a lonely star: no-mans-land is hope!
W: Step in which direction?
W: Oh strings of zenith, dance my feet tip-toe dizzy
W: Then snip me free-fall
W: Where isthmus and headland are one step away.

W: 
W: High on the headland of the Dulwich Hill platform, we wait for the next train.
W: How long do I have to be out in the late night air on the cold headland?
W: The young Islander boys passing by are in high spirits.
W: 
W: The clock ticks over in that electronic way.
W: And the fluro lights buzz,
W: With that noise they make.
W: Or is it my tinnitus?
W: 
W: It's said the Lyrids meteor shower will be the celestial attraction tonight.
W: I'd like to see a meteor shower.
W: I've tried many times to see one but no success.
W: Can I stay up that late?
W: Surely, it's past my bedtime.
W: 
W: The claxon says "The next train to arrive goes to City Circle".
W: No that's the wrong way.
W: Give me the Belmore train and take me off this headland high.
W: 
W: Now our train comes, and the Islander boys get on the train too,
W: And sing four-part harmony with mouth percussion.
W: Is This Love - The Lion Sleeps Tonight - Lean On Me - Stand By Me.
W: Way cool.
W: They are very good.
W: 
W: I could be high on a headland where the bay is a mystery.

W: High On The Headland                  By Andrew Kordas
W: 
W: High on the headland the mystery of the bay
W: Reveal the clues of that hapless day
W: 
W: If there up high the view was plain to see?
W: But the observer's perspective can be obscured
W: Herein the events are now disclosed
W: The bay was calm and into the sea the crew was lured
W: 
W: Unbeknownst to them unclad
W: That dip was their last to be had
W: A rip came through and out they were dragged
W: They struggled and flailed,
W: efforts flaunted and failed
W: 
W: Chances diminished as a dorsal arrived
W: But not one nor two, a dozen more
W: Hard to tell but those large slippery forms encircled them
W: The crystal-clear aqueous azure
W: Gave way to a frenzied claret
W: All were sacrificed in a gluttonous feast
W: Devoured by the gnashing of those underwater beasts
W: Not a skerrick of their anatomy was spared as evidence
W: To tell the tale of their sordid providence.
W: 
W: HARRY'S  TALE                                                                            By Anne Burrell
W: 
W: Disclaimer:  Any similarity to any Harry real or imagined, true or untrue, hairy or otherwise is purely coincidental. The story and characters are completely and absolutely fictional and I believe only the subject of camp myth and legend.
W: 
W: Hairy Harry stood high on the headland
W: His head stood higher still
W: But his heart was heavy and sad now
W: As he pondered on what he just did
W: 
W: For he woke in the camp after midnight
W: Thirst and hunger disturbing his sleep
W: He went through all he had with him
W: But his hunger and thirst did persist
W: 
W: He drank everything he could find in camp
W: And ate till he'd eaten his fill
W: Now nothing remained for the campers
W: And things looked decidedly grim
W: 
W: He was sure to be shunned and expelled now
W: By all fellow campers and friends
W: For the transgression was certainly major
W: The worst there had ever been
W: 
W: They wouldn't be pleased or forgiving
W: When they woke and discovered the deed
W: No telling what steps would be taken
W: When hunger and thirst settled in
W: 
W: But he knew it wouldn't be pretty
W: So, he left the high headland `post haste'
W: He left the camp `hell for leather'
W: And we haven't seen him since

W: When my friend calls me up and this is what she said
W: Her daughter's gone missing in the city without a trace
W: It's been 2 whole days since anyone saw her face
W: 
W: Your blood curdles and your gut sinks to the ground
W: All of a sudden you can't hear a sound
W: How does one cope with such desperation?
W: Or prepare you for this unthinkable situation
W: 
W: And she waits and she waits and she waits for a call
W: For just a sign or a clue or for anything at all
W: That can point the search onto the right track
W: And all she wants is her baby back
W: 
W: The future has never been ours to see
W: But it's different this time as the uncertainty
W: Is causing her head to explode
W: Her whole life about to erode
W: 
W: What will the future bring?
W: What will the future bring?
W: You would give anything

W: The Banjo Whisperer                      Charlotte Lyngbye    26/4/2016
W: 
W: There's something very weird - happening right here
W: Lately I've been hearing a strange whisper in my ear
W: Sometimes my left  - sometimes my right
W: I hear that whisper in the middle of the night
W: I try ignoring it -  but it's all in vain
W: Am I slowly going insane?
W: 
W: And just as I thought I've re-claimed my sleep
W: A friend of mine is selling his old banjo really cheap
W: He thinks that I - have the time
W: To learn another instrument of mine
W: I fear my man - will confiscate it
W: Just about to make my life complicated
W: 
W: But I must learn the banjo insists the little voice
W: I need that like a hole in the head but it seems I have no choice
W: No matter how much - I am resisting
W: The whisper just keeps on insisting
W: Has anybody -  seen my mind?
W: Have I lost it or left it behind
W: 
W: Cos here I am,  - Learning to play
W: Doing battle with this banjo every day
W: I never thought  -  I'd be seen dead
W: I must have a hole in my head

W: 
W: We met on the train, it was the Central Line
W: And fate put us together for just a moment in time
W: When the train came to a halt too quick
W: And an old man toppled over with his walking stick
W: 
W: We both rushed over to help him on his feet
W: When our heads banged together, well that's one way to meet
W: As we helped the old man up, you smiled at me
W: And I knew I liked you instantly
W: 
W: But the next stop was yours and as you walked out the door
W: I watched you move away into the rain
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: I just met you then you were gone
W: And I didn't even catch your name
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: It's such a shame
W: If only we'd had one more stop
W: I could have asked your name
W: 
W: Perhaps I'll go back and ride on that train
W: Hoping for the chance to meet you again
W: From the same place at the same time
W: Thinking you might be travelling that line
W: 
W: I only got to know you for 3 stops
W: Now I wanna know you for 3 more
W: I should have held you there a little longer
W: I should have come on a little stronger
W: 
W: But the next stop was yours and you walked out the door
W: And in the end there's no one else to blame
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: I just met you then you were gone
W: And I didn't even catch your name
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: It's such a shame

W: 
W: There are hundreds of people milling round this place

W: A face so familiar, cemented to my past
W: I'm excited and I'm nervous to meet with you at last
W: You told me you'd look older, you warned me you've gone grey

W: And so here we are meeting in this place
W: And I can't wait to see that cheeky smile upon your face

W: You're fishing for a fight
W: So damn prickly and tense

W: But if you're quick
W: You can duck and avoid the stick, duck & muck

W: Empty and free
W: I am empty
W: Empty and free

W: And feel just how small and unimportant we are
W: Breathing in awe, finding respect
W: Learning to center and to reconnect
W: 
W: This void is my guide to finding my place
W: It's plain as the wind and the open space
W: It's plain as the gravel that slips through my fingers

W: Empty and free
W: I am empty
W: Empty and free

W: I hover above and watch my body sinking

W: But my pal said: please get here soon
W: We'll Scrabble underneath the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: But as the afternoon approach, a storm in closing in
W: And for an hour we get hammered by the rain and by the wind
W: But what's a little weather when all your friends are here
W: We cosy under every tarp and share the rainy atmosphere
W: 
W: I'm trying to get there at noon
W: But I have work to do, I can't just up and go
W: But my friend said: please get here soon
W: So we can play under the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: But somehow those powerlines they vitalise and energise
W: We like to think they add a spark to help us socialise
W: Cos sitting round the campfire with all my friends just playing
W: There's a magic going on that no one can explain
W: 
W: So I'll definitely get there by noon
W: And I've done my work it's time for me to go
W: And my mate said: please get here soon
W: So we can sing under the Numerella Moon
W: So lets all sing under the Numerella Moon

W: The Tudor Court Hotel                 Charlotte Lyngbye 15 February 2018
W: 
W: I left my home in Denmark when I was just eighteen
W: Went off to work in London as an aupair  - what was I thinking
W: With guitar in hand and army jacket I arrived in Golders Green
W: To a suburban Jewish family, both orthodox and mean
W: So being me and a bit of a rebel, that didn't work out too well
W: But thankfully I scored a new job
W: At The Tudor Court Hotel
W: 
W: This run down backpackers in the heart of Paddington
W: A 5 storey terrace with polyester sheets in every room
W: I worked in the reception and as a chambermaid
W: I lived in on the premises as well as getting paid
W: The young folks there were friendly, and we'd party till we fell
W: And I sowed a bunch of wild oats
W: At The Tudor Court Hotel
W: 
W: When Rob, a tall dark stranger, who came all the way from Broome
W: We danced and held hands 5 flights upstairs to his room
W: He was leaving the next day so it was never meant to be
W: Years later he was in a Caltex advertising on TV
W: I'm glad to see Rob has a job, and that he still looks so well
W: But I still recall that night on the 5[th] floor
W: Of The Tudor Court Hotel
W: 
W: But the good times wouldn't last, and trouble was ahead
W: When they hired a new manager to run the Tudor Court instead
W: His name was Elvis, I kid you not, he smelt and he was greek
W: Nothing wrong with being greek as long as you don't reek
W: His hands were often sweaty and he was creepy as all hell
W: So bolted for the door and quit my job
W: at The Tudor Court Hotel
W: 
W: But a girl I worked with, Catherine, she was an English rose
W: Later on we spent some girl time travelling the globe
W: We visited her handsome cousin who lived in ACT
W: Then yada yada yada and the rest is history
W: So that's the story of how I got here, there's probably more to tell
W: But it all started when I rang the door bell

W: Can never tie him down past the setting of the sun
W: Despite his disappearing you know he is your friend
W: And you learn to be patient till you catch him out again
W: 
W: He's a most incredibly crepuscular creature
W: Leaving on a high note, his most prominent feature
W: Best before sunset and just on twilight
W: His intriguing conversation engages and delights
W:

W: I've come out into the wild with a group of my friends
W: It's time to re-connect with Mother Nature again
W: It's windy and dusty and the mosquitos are biting
W: Goannas underfoot and the kangaroos are fighting
W: 
W: We gather together every afternoon
W: It's time for a snack and refreshment and soon
W: The tables are crammed with bisquits and dip
W: With cheeses and colorful drinks to sip
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: So what is your poison I ask you my friend
W: A Margerita, a or a triple Whiskey Sour again
W: Pina Colada, a Cosmo, Aperitivo or Manhatten
W: Cos' these pretzels are making me thirsty
W: 
W: A handful of Dorritos goes right down my hatch
W: A grasshopper suddenly awaits in my glass
W: I drink it down in one gulp and I show it no mercy
W: `Cos dammit these cheesy corn chips are making me thirsty
W: 
W: Now I'm staring in awe at a bright Blue lagoon
W: It's looking to become a wild afternoon
W: The next thing it's gone I have sculled the whole lot
W: I'm well on my way to loosing the plot
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: I can't resist these drinks so colorful and bright
W: That cheer up my day and match my fairy light
W: Too easy to drink like it's mothers milk
W: I'm feeling like singing, my voice as smooth as silk

W: It's like a strange presence, an alarm in the air
W: Unseen and unspoken, it does not declare
W: So slowly, it creeps up your spine
W: Sneaks up on you, and approach from behind
W: 
W: I can feel my blood freeze, and my stomach curdle

W: Run from this evil within
W: Please give me the strength to stand up face off my sin
W: I'm so scared
W: It's taking me over
W: This dark energy is getting under my skin
W: 
W: So am I deluded, is that my new deal
W: Or is it just my imagination that makes it so real
W: The band is playing danger music inside my head
W: There's the smell of foreboding and the sinister feeling of dread
W: 
W: I am uncertain, of what it is I am fighting
W: Like a sitting duck, just prior to hell fire igniting
W: Why am I being saddled, with all this anguish
W: Invaded by angry demons that I must vanquish

W: Everything Has To Be Goat Blues                Charlotte Lyngbye - 28 October 2015
W: 
W: I used to drink milk from a cow, when having my cuppa tea
W: And a nice hunk of lamb in a curry, well, that was just the ticket for me
W: But the latest trend in food and drink just doesn't float my boat
W: Cos Ladies & Gentleman these days, everything has to be GOAT
W: 
W: Whenever I go to a restaurant and order my big salad
W: They all contain this GOATS cheese, it does nothing for my palate
W: I'm looking at the menu while I'm waiting at my table
W: It may be the latest rave but it just tastes like a goat stable
W: 
W: Don't know `bout you, but the last time I checked a GOAT didn't smell too well
W: And now they expect me to devour it, am I in heaven or hell
W: We must adapt and change, to keep up with the latest fashion
W: This year it's GOAT but however it comes I just can't feel the passion
W: 
W: A moustache was the thing to sport if you were a bloke inthe 70ies
W: The distinguished handlebars was the facial hair of the roaring 20ies
W: But all of a sudden a man is not cool unless he has a GOATIE
W: A tuft of bristle on the chin, to keep the wind off his throatie
W: 
W: In the bathroom I used to keep Imperial Lather on a rope
W: Or Lux or Dove it didn't matter as long as it was soap
W: My daily power shower left my skin as smooth as silk
W: But oh no don't use that again, only organic soap with GOATs milk
W: 
W: Don't know `bout you, but the last time I checked a GOAT didn't smell too well
W: And now they expect me to devour it, am I in heaven or hell
W: We must adapt and change, to keep up with the latest fashion
W: This year it's GOAT but however it comes I just can't feel the passion

W: 
W: You say you ain't got none,  - well think again
W: And pinch yourself hard  - until you feel the pain
W: You're so damn lucky,
W: To even have a roof over your head,
W: So let's not forget - to have some respect
W: For all of those less fortunate
W: 
W: You always complain  - that you are tight
W: I wish you'd shut up about being broke
W: While you lunch out every day
W: And sip your $5 latte
W: You shouldn't joke
W: And compare yourself to the poor folk
W: Cos' all your money's gone up in smoke
W: 
W: We crave it, and earn it,
W: We save it, then burn it
W: We're so obsessed
W: With those little bits of paper with noughts on it
W: It can drive you crazy and surely ruin everything
W: When you think you - deserve to live like a king
W: Just in case you are wondering
W: 
W: You can buy a brand new car, - a new coffee table
W: And artwork that matches your couch
W: Another guitar
W: Or an electric tie carousel
W: A new boat and a flat screen
W: New Gucci loafers as well
W: On your road to consumer hell

W: 
W: After that day in the park in 1969
W: I didn't see Frank Mills again for many years
W: I used to love him so much and I still dream of him from time to time
W: He's always summed up all my joys and all my fears
W: 
W: He used to make my little teenage heart skip such a giant beat
W: And I often wonder would he even remember me
W: He looked so cool and breezy as he swayed and swaggered down the street
W: He had a way of making life look so easy
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: I loved him - and in a strange way I still do
W: I loved him  -  oh Frank Mills where are you
W: I loved him  -  he still lives inside of me
W: I loved him - my unspoilt fantasy
W: 
W: I've been wondering where he went and what's become of him
W: Is his leather jacket still his favourite thing to wear
W: I used to get so high just to walking along beside him
W: And losing him was nearly more that I could bear
W: 
W: But life has a way of answering all your questions
W: When last June I saw him walking in the Park
W: And he said "Hey babes" I think we still have a spark
W: The years were showing but he's eyes still had that spark
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: I loved him - and I know that I still do
W: I loved him  -  oh Frank Mills it's really you
W: I love him  -  and he still remembers me
W: I love him  -  Let him never set me free

W: Too easy how a life can life change
W: You're in the north-bound lane
W: When at the drop of a hat
W: The south wind blows and that's that
W: 
W: Never saw the writing on the wall
W: When you hear heavy boots coming down the hall
W: Do you hide yourself under the floor
W: or make straight for the back door?
W: 
W: So do you run run run run
W: When the devil snapping at your tail
W: Never thought
W: this could happen to you
W: 
W: Where do you run to, Where do you hide
W: To stay above the rising tide
W: Keep afloat, get in the boat
W: Just to stay alive
W: 
W: You're a fugitive in the middle of the night
W: You know it won't be a fair fight
W: You believed all the lies that said
W: that everything's would be allright
W: 
W: Forget the past, get straight on the move
W: Do things you thought you'd never do
W: No time for packing up or selling out
W: Only getting up and getting out

W: No one warned you to watch out
W: That it was unwise to take
W: so much for granted

W: 
W: When i returned to my town of youth
W: Everywhere are cranes, hoarding and equipment
W: They're digging in the parks, they're digging up the earth
W: Digging up the roads in the city up my birth
W: And the noise is deafening
W: They're going underground
W: 
W: And just like a wild fire
W: The ugliness is spreading
W: Out with the old, in with the new
W: A nasty rash on the face of my hometown
W: Just to get under the surface
W: And travel underground
W: 
W: I loathe this godless tunneled space
W: That exists deep under the bitumen
W: This claustrophobic beast will haunt me
W: As soon as i descend down the escalators
W: And tightens it's grip on my throat
W: As I move down
W: I can hardly breathe
W: As I'm going underground
W: 
W: I want a view from my bus and my train
W: I value my sense of direction
W: Please don't ask me to cram together
W: With these strangers in these gloomy tunnels
W: Beneath the city
W: Going underground
W: 
W: Thank heavens for my bike
W: That's still my favorite way to get around town
W: I need to feel the changing of the weather
W: I wanna watch all the real life stories
W: Playing out on every street
W: I tell ya, I'm not going underground
W: I'll never go underground

W: Watching you grovin' down the street
W: It still pinches a little, and I feel a bit silly
W: But you look so young and you look so sweet
W: 
W: And I am thinking; what the heck
W: What if it it keeps me on my feet
W: I'm allowed to fantasise
W: About your gorgeousness and your big brown eyes
W: 
W: But back here on earth where I mostly reside
W: I work in the office from nine until five
W: And wonder why must I be stuck in this place
W: I'd rather steal glimpses at your smiling face
W: 
W: But reality always gets in my way
W: So I dream about you just to get through my day
W: This little trick of mine, which I often rely
W: Keeps a spring in my step and a sparkle in my eye
