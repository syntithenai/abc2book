W: O the waves crash in and the tide pulls out
W: It's an angry sea but there is no doubt
W: That the lighthouse will keep shining out
W: To warn the lonely sailor
W: And the lightning strikes and the wind cuts cold
W: Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul
W: Till there's nothing left that he can hold
W: Except the rolling ocean
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm
W: 
W: Give me mercy for my dreams
W: For every confrontation seems
W: To tell me what it really means
W: To be this lonely sailor
W: But when the sky begins to clear
W: And the sun it melts away my fear
W: I'll cry a silent weary tear
W: For those that need to ove me
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm
W: 
W: But distance it is no real friend
W: And time it takes its time
W: But you will find that in the end
W: It brings you me the lonely sailor
W: But when you take me by your side
W: You love me warm, you love me
W: And I should have realized
W: I had no reasons to be frightened
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm

W: The water is wide, I cannot get oer
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: Give me a boat that can carry two
W: And both shall row, my love and I
W: 
W: A ship there is and she sails the sea
W: She's loaded deep as deep can be
W: But not so deep as the love I'm in
W: I know not if I sink or swim
W: 
W: I leaned my back against an oak
W: Thinking it was a trusty tree
W: But first it bent and then it broke
W: So did my love prove false to me
W: 
W: I reached my finger into some soft bush
W: Thinking the fairest flower to find
W: I pricked my finger to the bone
W: And left the fairest flower behind
W: 
W: Oh love be handsome and love be kind
W: Gay as a jewel when first it is new
W: But love grows old and waxes cold
W: And fades away like the morning dew
W: 
W: Must I go bound while you go free
W: Must I love a man who doesn't love me
W: Must I be born with so little art
W: As to love a man who'll break my heart
W: 
W: When cockle shells turn silver bells
W: Then will my love come back to me
W: When roses bloom in winter's gloom
W: Then will my love return to me

W: 
W: If life is a river and your heart is a boat
W: And just like a water baby, baby born to float
W: And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
W: And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
W: 'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
W: Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
W: And we stack all the dead men in self-addressed crates
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day
W: When fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
W: And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
W: Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
W: Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: And heaven has its way
W: When all will harmonise
W: And know it's in our hearts
W: The dream will realise
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes

W: Will I wait a lonely lifetime
W: If you want me to, I will
W:

W: Love you with all my heart

W: 
W: And when at last I find you
W: Your song will fill the air
W: Sing it loud so I can hear you
W: Make it easy to be near you
W: For the things you do endear you to me
W: You know I will
W: I will

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Soft Rain - Soft Rain
W: falling on my fields
W: Soft Rain - Soft Rain - Soft Rain
W: 
W: It seem so long ago
W: since first I saw the slow, slow rain
W: come falling down
W: With spinners lures and lines
W: we passed the summer time
W: and rowed those cliffs around
W: And the Fishermen beneath their caps would nod
W: "Sure that's a fine soft day, Thank God"
W: 
W: My father walked
W: those fields in his time
W: when he held me by the hand
W: With horses and with plow
W: as the seasons would allow
W: they'd reap and sow the land
W: 
W: I never thought I'd break that chain
W: but sometimes I can feel the rain
W: Still in my mind a soft voice calls
W: where Atlantic washes o'er stone walls

W: The ol' cat on the roof
W: He could stand a little push
W: 'Cause he's got nine good lives to live
W: 
W: But like my Mama said
W: You only live 'til your dead
W: And you got to give and give and give
W: 
W: There's a pebble in the pond
W: Rollin' on and on
W: Makin' waves and tides and ripples and rain
W: 
W: There's a leaf in the wind
W: That don't know where to end
W: Chasin' days and ways and wishes and dreams
W: 
W: Seems like everyone is out lookin' for the sun
W: Singin' rain and pain on he who hesitates
W: But it'll shine when it shines
W: You might think I'm wastin' time
W: But I'm just a good ol' boy that's learned to wait
W: 
W: Whippoorwill's in the dawn
W: Pretty soon he'll be gone
W: And he's got one good song to sing
W: 
W: But like my Daddy said
W: It's in your heart not your head
W: And you got to sing and sing and sing
W: 
W: There's a window in the wall
W: Lookin' out on it all
W: Leavin' fears and tears and troubles alone
W: 
W: There's a fire in the stove
W: Keepin' out the cold
W: Warmin' wine and winters and babies and homes
W: 
W: Seems like everyone is out lookin' for the sun

W: I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande
W: But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan
W: I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow
W: Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how
W: Sure ain't a fixing to start in now
W: Oh, yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande
W: And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand
W: I'm a riding fool who is up to date
W: I know every trail in the Lone Star State
W: 'Cause I ride the range in a Ford V 8
W: Oh, yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: Yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande
W: And we come to town just to hear the band
W: We know all the songs that the cowboys know
W: 'Bout the big corral where the doggies go
W: We learned them all on the radio
W: Yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: I'm an old cowhand
W: (Oh yes, Mr. Bing)
W: (Too hot for you, Uncle Fudd)
W: Down from the Rio Grande
W: Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland
W: Where the buffalo roam around the zoo
W: And the Injuns run up a rug or two
W: And the old Bar X is just a barbecue, yeah
W: Yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: I'm a pioneer who began from scratch
W: I don't bat an eye in a shootin' match
W: They don't call me Elmer, they call me Satch
W: Yippie yi yo kayah, yippie yi yo kayah
W: 
W: Get along little horsy
W: Get along little horsy

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I don't know if you can see the changes that have come over me
W: In these last few days I've been afraid that I might drift away
W: So I've been telling old stories, singing songs that make me think about where I came from
W: And that's the reason why I seem so far away today
W: 
W: But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me and now I'm going home
W: But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
W: 
W: I have moved and I've kept on moving, proved the points that I needed proving
W: Lost the friends that I needed losing, found others on the way
W: I have kissed the ladies and left them crying, stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
W: I have travelled hard, sometimes with conscience flying somewhere with the wind
W: 
W: But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me and now I'm going home
W: But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
W: 
W: Now I'm sitting here before the fire, the empty room, the forest choir
W: The flames that couldn't get any higher, well they've withered, now they've gone
W: But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear and I know what I will do tomorrow
W: When the hands have shaken and the kisses flow, well I will disappear
W: 
W: But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me and now I'm going home
W: For if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

B: fiona
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
W: Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
W: Soar Black Head against the sky
W: Between the rocks that run down to the sea
W: 
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
W: Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
W: 
W: Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
W: Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
W: 
W: Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
W: Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: 
W: Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
W: Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
W: Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: 
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland
