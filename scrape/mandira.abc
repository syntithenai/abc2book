W: The water is wide, I cannot get oer
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: Give me a boat that can carry two
W: And both shall row, my love and I
W: 
W: A ship there is and she sails the sea
W: She's loaded deep as deep can be
W: But not so deep as the love I'm in
W: I know not if I sink or swim
W: 
W: I leaned my back against an oak
W: Thinking it was a trusty tree
W: But first it bent and then it broke
W: So did my love prove false to me
W: 
W: I reached my finger into some soft bush
W: Thinking the fairest flower to find
W: I pricked my finger to the bone
W: And left the fairest flower behind
W: 
W: Oh love be handsome and love be kind
W: Gay as a jewel when first it is new
W: But love grows old and waxes cold
W: And fades away like the morning dew
W: 
W: Must I go bound while you go free
W: Must I love a man who doesn't love me
W: Must I be born with so little art
W: As to love a man who'll break my heart
W: 
W: When cockle shells turn silver bells
W: Then will my love come back to me
W: When roses bloom in winter's gloom
W: Then will my love return to me

W: Well, I recall his parting words
W: Must I accept his fate?
W: Or take myself far from this place
W: I thought I heard a black bell toll
W: A little bird did sing
W: Man has no choice when he wants everything
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: [Verse 2]
W: Man goes beyond his own decision
W: Gets caught up in the mechanism
W: Of swindlers who act like kings
W: And brokers who break everything
W: The dark of night was swiftly fading
W: Close to the dawn of day
W: Why would I want him just to lose him again?
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride

W: 
W: Now and then I think of when we were together

W: 
W:

W: 
W: You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

W: 
W: Well you said that we would still be friends

W: But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

W: But you treat me like a stranger
W: 
W: F       G
W: 
W: And that feels so rough
W: 
W: You didn't have to stoop so low
W: 
W: Have your friends collect your records

W: 
W: I guess that I don't need that though
W: 
W: Now you're just somebody that I used to know
W: 
W: Verse 3:

W: 
W: And I don't wanna live that way
W: 
W: F      Am      G
W: 
W: Reading into every word you say
W: 
W: F      Am        G
W: 
W: You said that you could let it go
W: 
W: F      Am         G
W: 
W: And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: 
W: But you didn't have to cut me off

W: And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
W: But leave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
W: Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls
W: 
W: Oh the barroom girls go by your side
W: Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
W: And all of the colors go 'round in a swirl
W: When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls
W: Now she rolls to her feet when she can't sleep no more
W: And looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
W: Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
W: Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls
W: Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls

W: Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
W: Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
W: The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
W: Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
W: The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
W: My love he wooed me as I lie there
W: With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy
W: Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush
W: 
W: When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom
W: The blackberry blossom was white as the snow
W: But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses
W: And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow
W: The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon
W: Known for his cackling and his screaming
W: Driving away the swallow and the thrush
W: From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush
W: 
W: I was picking berries when that crow flew above me
W: Carrying my lover so far away
W: Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom
W: By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay
W: The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard
W: With weeds growing over in the old graveyard
W: And the day settles down to an evening hush
W: Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush

W: The lunatic is in the hall.

W: And if the dam breaks open many years too soon,

W: And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too,
W: I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
W: The lunatic is in my head.
W: The lunatic is in my head.
W: You raise the blade, you make the change,
W: You rearrange me 'till I'm sane.
W: You lock the door
W: And throw away the key,
W: There's someone in my head but it's not me.
W: 
W: And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear,
W: 
W: You shout and no one seems to hear,
W: And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes,
W: I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.
W: "I can't think of anything to say, except...
W: 
W: I think it's marvelous."
W: 
W: All that you touch
W: And all that you see
W: All that you taste, all you feel
W: And all that you love

W: All you distrust, all you save
W: And all that you give

W: And all you create
W: And all you destroy
W: And all that you do
W: And all that you say
W: And all that you eat
W: And everyone you meet
W: And all that you slight
W: And everyone you fight
W: And all that is now
W: And all that is gone
W: And all that's to come
W: And everything under the sun is in tune,

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: In the cool of the evening they used to gather beneath the stars, in the meadow, circled near an old oak tree.
W: 
W: At the times appointed by the seasons of the earth and the phases of the moon.
W: 
W: In the centre often stood a woman, equal to the others and respected for her worth.
W: 
W: One of the many we call the witches, the healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth.
W: 
W: People grew in the knowledge she gave them, herbs to heal their bodies spells to make their spirits whole.
W: 
W: Hear them chanting healing incantations-calling for the wise ones celebrating in dance and song.
W: 
W: ISIS-ASTARTE-DIANA-HECATI-DEMETER-KALI-INANNA
W: 
W: There were those who came to power through domination, bonded in their worship of a dead man on the cross.
W: 
W: They sought control over all people, demanding allegiance to the church of Rome.
W: 
W: The pope commenced the inquisition – a war against women whose powers were feared.
W: 
W: In this holocaust, this century of evil, nine million European women died.
W: 
W: The tale is told of those who by the hundreds, holding hands together chose their deaths in the sea.
W: 
W: Chanting the praises of the mother goddess, a refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free.
W: 
W: ISIS-ASTARTE-DIANA-HECATI-DEMETER-KALI-INANNA
W: 
W: Now the Earth is a witch, we still burn her, stripping her down with mining and the poison of our wars.
W: 
W: Still to us the Earth is still a healer a teacher and a Mother a weaver of a web that keeps us all alive.
W: 
W: She gives us the wisdom to see through the chaos, she gives us the courage it is our will to survive.
W: 
W: ISIS-ASTARTE-DIANA-HECATI-DEMETER-KALI-INNANNA.

W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: As one grew bright as is the sun
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: So coal black grew the elder one
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: [Verse 3]
W: A knight came riding to the lady's door
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: He'd travelled far to be their wooer
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: He courted one with gloves and rings
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: But he loved the other above all things
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: "Oh sister, will you go with me"
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "To watch the ships sail on the sea?"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 6]
W: She took her sister by the hand
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom

W: Crying, "Sister, reach to me your hand!"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 9]

W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "But thou shalt never come ashore"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W:

W: 
W: [Verse 13]
W: They've made a harp of her breastbone
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: Whose sound would melt a heart of stone
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 14]
W: They took three locks of her yellow hair
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: And with them strung the harp so rare
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 15]
W: They went into her father's hall
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: To play the harp before them all
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 16]
W: But as they laid it on a stone
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: The harp began to play alone
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 17]
W: The first string sang a doleful sound
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "The bride her younger sister drowned"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 18]
W: The second string as that they tried
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "In terror sits the black-haired bride"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 19]
W: The third string sang beneath their bow
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "And surely now her tears will flow"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

W: Why don't you come to your senses?
W: You've been out ridin' fences
W: For so long now
W: Oh, you're a hard one
W: But I know that you got your reasons
W: These things that are pleasin' you
W: Can hurt you somehow
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy

W: Desperado
W: Oh, you ain't getting no younger

W: Ain't it funny how the feeling goes

W: You better let somebody love you
W: (Let somebody love you)
W: You better let somebody love you

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Well I'll be damned
W: Here comes your ghost again
W: But that's not unusual
W: It's just that the moon is full
W: And you happened to call
W: And here I sit
W: Hand on the telephone
W: Hearing a voice I'd known
W: A couple of light years ago
W: Heading straight for a fall
W: As I remember your eyes
W: Were bluer than robin's eggs
W: My poetry was lousy you said
W: Where are you calling from?
W: A booth in the midwest
W: Ten years ago
W: I bought you some cufflinks
W: You brought me something
W: We both know what memories can bring
W: They bring diamonds and rust
W: 
W: Well you burst on the scene
W: Already a legend
W: The unwashed phenomenon
W: The original vagabond
W: You strayed into my arms
W: And there you stayed
W: Temporarily lost at sea
W: The Madonna was yours for free
W: Yes the girl on the half-shell
W: Would keep you unharmed
W: 
W: Now I see you standing
W: With brown leaves falling around
W: And snow in your hair
W: Now you're smiling out the window
W: Of that crummy hotel
W: Over Washington Square
W: Our breath comes out white clouds
W: Mingles and hangs in the air
W: Speaking strictly for me
W: We both could have died then and there
W: 
W: Now you're telling me
W: You're not nostalgic
W: Then give me another word for it
W: You who are so good with words
W: And at keeping things vague
W: Because I need some of that vagueness now
W: It's all come back too clearly
W: Yes I loved you dearly
W: And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
W: I've already paid

W: When God dips His love in my heart

W: When God dips His pen of love in my heart
W: And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
W: His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: Well He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: Well sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold
W: And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
W: I go to God in prayer, I can always find Him there
W: To whisper sweet peace to my soul
W: 
W: Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: Well He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way
W: And gave His life completely to bring a better day
W: My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
W: His blood washed away every stain
W: 
W: I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire

W: Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
W: Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo
W: 
W: [Verso 2]
W: Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
W: Me ha dado el oído que en todo su ancho

W: Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos
W: Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado
W: [Verso 3]
W: Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto

W: Con él las palabras, que pienso y declaro
W: Madre, amigo, hermano y luz alumbrando
W: La ruta del alma del que estoy amando
W: 
W: [Verso 4]
W: Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
W: Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados
W: Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos
W: Playas y desiertos, montañas y llanos
W: Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio
W: 
W: [Verso 5]
W: Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
W: Me dio el corazón que agita su marco
W: Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano
W: Cuando miro el bueno tan lejos del malo
W: Cuando miro el fondo de tus ojos claros
W: 
W: [Verso 6]
W: Gracias a la vida, que me ha dado tanto
W: Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

W: Nor point our bold guns to the sea
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: Then broadside and broadside and at it they went

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: On the first part of the journey
W: I was looking at all the life
W: There were plants and birds and rocks and things
W: There was sand and hills and rings
W: The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
W: And the sky with no clouds
W: The heat was hot and the ground was dry
W: But the air was full of sound
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
W: It felt good to be out of the rain
W: In the desert you can remember your name
W: 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: [Verse 2]
W: After two days in the desert sun
W: My skin began to turn red
W: After three days in the desert fun
W: I was looking at a river bed
W: And the story it told of a river that flowed
W: Made me sad to think it was dead
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
W: It felt good to be out of the rain
W: In the desert you can remember your name
W: Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: After nine days I let the horse run free
W: 'Cause the desert had turned to sea
W: There were plants and birds and rocks and things
W: There was sand and hills and rings
W: The ocean is a desert with its life underground
W: And a perfect disguise above
W: Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
W: But the humans will give no love

W: Well I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been
W: For three score years in this little isle of green
W: I'm known along the Liffy from the Basin to the Zoo
W: And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
W: For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
W: He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
W: But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo
W: 
W: I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn
W: A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn
W: There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
W: And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo
W: 
W: Who did I waken but the woman of the house
W: With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
W: She began to frighten and I said boo
W: Sure, don't be afraid at all, it's only Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: I met a little girl while a walkin out one day
W: Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say
W: Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
W: With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo
W: 
W: I'll buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
W: And a nice young lady I'll go courting by and by
W: I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them with blue
W: And an old fashioned lady I will make her too
W: 
W: So all along the high road with my bag upon my back
W: Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
W: With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
W: Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo
W: 
W: O I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
W: The fire is all raked and now tis out of light
W: For now you've heard the story of my auld rigadoo
W: So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu

T: Since You And I Were True
C:Pauline Scanlon
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: We might as well lie down, love
W: Lie down and close our eyes
W: We might as well go walking
W: In the country of the blind
W: The long grass is grown
W: And all the birds flown
W: To their homes away in the blue
W: And nothing's left the same
W: The whole world is changed
W: Since you and I were true
W: And how can a story be ended
W: When it didn't hardly begin?
W: How can my glass be so empty
W: When it's filled up to the brim?
W: And it wasn't always so
W: It didn't always go
W: We had something better to do
W: And it didn't always rain
W: Every single day
W: When you and I were true
W: 
W: In a country where we are headed, love
W: There is nothing but rocks and stones
W: No friendly plant or animal
W: No angel to guide you home
W: Until some day you'll find
W: In the country of the blind
W: Some wonder just like you
W: And the singing of a bird
W: That nobody has heard
W: Since you and I were true
W: 
W: We might as well lie down, love
W: Lie down and close our eyes
W: We might as well go walking
W: In the country of the blind
W: The long grass is grown
W: And all the birds flown
W: To their homes away in the blue
W: And nothing's left the same
W: The whole world is changed
W: Since you and I were true

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: One evening as the sun went down
W: And the jungle fire was burning
W: Down the track came a hobo hikin'
W: And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
W: I'm headed for a land that's far away
W: Besides the crystal fountains
W: So come with me, we'll go and see
W: The Big Rock Candy Mountains."
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: There's a land that's fair and bright
W: Where the handouts grow on bushes
W: And you sleep out every night
W: Where the boxcars all are empty
W: And the sun shines everyday
W: All the birds and the bees
W: And the cigarette trees
W: The lemonade springs
W: Where the bluebird sings
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: [Verse 3]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: All the cops have wooden legs
W: And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
W: And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
W: The farmers' trees are full of fruit
W: And the barns are full of hay
W: Oh, I'm bound to go
W: Where there ain't no snow
W: Where the rain don't fall
W: The wind don't blow
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: You never change your socks
W: And the little streams of alcohol
W: Come trickling down the rocks
W: The brakemen have to tip their hats
W: And the railroad bulls are blind
W: There's a lake of stew
W: And of whiskey too
W: You can paddle all around them
W: In a big canoe
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: The jails are made of tin
W: And you can walk right out again
W: As soon as you are in
W: There ain't no short-handled shovels
W: No axes, saws, or picks
W: I'm going to stay
W: Where you sleep all day
W: Where they hung the Turk
W: That invented work
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: I'll see you all this coming fall
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

C:Eilen Jewell

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Somewhere out west a freighter rides by
W: You used to watch them pass with their grit in your eye
W: And the wild dogs under darkening sky
W: Still listen for your lonesome lullaby
W: 
W: Way out in the desert you felt so free
W: How you loved those hills of Joshua Tree
W: Now there's a dusty path missing two dusty feet
W: Is this really how you wanted it to be
W: 
W: Everybody said you won't make it
W: Everybody said you're no good
W: But did you listen to them, in the end
W: Even though you swore you never would
W: The patch of ground where they found you that day
W: Is godforsaken, a barren place
W: Why did you have to go this way
W: Why did you go this way

C:Tim O'Brien
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One evening for pleasure I rambled
W: On the banks of some cold purling stream
W: I set down on a bed of primroses
W: And I gently fell into a dream
W: I dreamt that I saw a fair female
W: Her equal I never saw before
W: And I sighed for the laws of our country
W: As we stray there on Ireland?s green shore
W: 
W: Her cheeks were like two bloomin? roses
W: Her teeth were like ivory so white
W: Her eyes shone like two sparkling diamonds
W: Or the stars on some cold frosty night
W: She was dressed in the richist attire
W: And green was the mantle she wore
W: All bound down with the hemlocks and the roses
W: As we stray there on Ireland?s green shore
W: Transgression of joy I awoken
W: I found this was only a dream
W: That pretty fair female had fled me
W: I longed to be slumbering again
W: May the heavens above be her guardian
W: Though I know I?ll never see her anymore
W: May the goldliest sunbeam shine upon her
W: As she lies sleeping on Ireland?s green shore
W: 
W: One evening for pleasure I rambled
W: On the banks of some cold purling stream
W: I set down on a bed of primroses
W: And I gently fell into a dream

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I scare myself just thinking about you
W: I scare myself when I'm without you
W: I scare myself, the moment that you're gone
W: I scare myself when I let my thoughts run
W: 
W: And when they're running
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And when they're running
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: I scare myself and I don't mean lightly
W: I scare myself, it can get frightening
W: I scare myself to think what I could do
W: I scare myself, it's some kind of voodoo
W: 
W: And with that voodoo
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And with that voodoo
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: And with that voodoo
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And with that voodoo
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: But it's so, so very different when we're together
W: And I'm so, so, so much calmer, I feel better
W: 'Cause the stars already crossed our paths forever
W: And the sooner that we realize it, the better
W: 
W: And then I'll be with you and I won't scare myself
W: And I'll know what to do and I won't scare myself
W: And my thoughts will run and I won't scare myself
W: And I'll think of you and I won't scare myself

T: Lakes Of Pontchatrain
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: It was on one bright March morning
W: I bid New Orleans adieu.
W: And I took the road to Jackson town,
W: My fortune to renew,
W: I cursed all foreign money,
W: No credit could I gain,
W: Which filled my heart with longing for
W: The lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I stepped on board a railroad car,
W: Beneath the morning sun,
W: I road the roads till evening,
W: And I laid me down again,
W: All strangers there no friends to me,
W: Till a dark girl towards me came,
W: And I fell in love with a Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I said, "My pretty Creole girl,
W: My money here's no good,
W: But if it weren't for the alligators,
W: I'd sleep out in the wood".
W: "You're welcome here kind stranger,
W: Our house is very plain.
W: But we never turn a stranger out,
W: From the lakes of Pontchartrain."
W: 
W: She took me into her mammy's house,
W: And treated me quite well,
W: The hair upon her shoulder
W: In jet black ringlets fell.
W: To try and paint her beauty,
W: I'm sure it would be in vain,
W: So handsome was my Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I asked her if she'd marry me,
W: She said it could never be,
W: For she had got another,
W: And he was far at sea.
W: She said that she would wait for him
W: And true she would remain.
W: Till he returned for his Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: So fare thee well my Creole girl,
W: I never will see you no more,
W: But I'll ne'er forget your kindness
W: In the cottage by the shore.
W: And at each social gathering
W: A flowing glass I'll raise,
W: And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl,
W: And the lakes of Pontchartrain.

C:Traditional
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One Sunday morning as I went walking
W: By Brisbane waters I chanced to stray
W: I heard a prisoner his fate bewailing
W: As on the sunny river bank he lay
W: I am a native from Erin's island
W: Transported now from my native shore
W: They tore me from my aged parents
W: And from the maiden whom I adore
W: 
W: I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
W: At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie
W: At all those settlements I've woked in chains
W: But of all places of condemnation
W: And penal stations of New South Wales
W: Of Moreton Bay I have found no equal
W: Excessive tyranny each day prevails
W: For three long years I was beastly treated
W: And heavy irons on my legs I wore
W: My back from flogging was lacerated
W: And often slain with my crimson gore
W: And many a man from downright starvation
W: Lies mouldering underneath the clay
W: And Captain Logan he had us mangled
W: At the triangles in Moreton Bay
W: 
W: Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
W: We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
W: Till a native black lying there in ambush
W: Did give our tyrant his mortal stroke
W: My fellow prisoners exhilarated
W: That all such monsters a death shall find
W: And when from bondage we're liberated
W: Our former sufferings shall fade from mind

C:Bobbie Gentry
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
W: I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
W: And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
W: And Mama hollered out the back door, "Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!"
W: And then she said, "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
W: Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
W: "Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
W: There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
W: And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
W: Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
W: [Verse 3]
W: And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
W: Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
W: And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
W: "I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
W: I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
W: And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Mama said to me, "Child, what's happened to your appetite?
W: I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
W: That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
W: Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
W: He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
W: And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
W: There was a virus going 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring
W: And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
W: And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

T: On Children
C:Kahlil Gibran
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Your children are not your children.
W: They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
W: They come through you but not from you,
W: And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
W: 
W: You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
W: For they have their own thoughts.
W: You may house their bodies but not their souls,
W: For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
W: You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
W: For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
W: You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
W: The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
W: Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
W: For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

W: Living on the road, my friend
W: Was gonna keep you free and clean
W: And now you wear your skin like iron
W: Your breath as hard as kerosene
W: You weren't your momma's only boy
W: But her favorite one, it seems
W: She began to cry when you said goodbye
W: And sank into your dreams
W: 
W: Pancho was a bandit boy
W: His horse was fast as polished steel
W: He wore his gun outside his pants
W: For all the honest world to feel
W: Pancho met his match, you know
W: On the deserts down in Mexico
W: Nobody heard his dying words
W: But that's the way it goes
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: They only let him slip away
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Lefty, he can't sing the blues
W: All night long like he used to
W: The dust that Pancho bit down South
W: Ended up in Lefty's mouth
W: The day they laid poor Pancho low
W: Lefty split for Ohio
W: Where he got the bread to go
W: There ain't nobody knows

W: And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
W: The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
W: And so the story ends, we're told
W: Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
W: But save a few for Lefty too
W: He only did what he had to do
W: And now he's growing old
W:

Q: 1/4=100

W: Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the theories of Freud,
W: He has taught me all the evils that my ego must avoid.
W: Repression of the impulses resuling paranoid
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
W: And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
W: Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol - or something else -
W: And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
W: You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
W: Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
W: But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the cheques
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
W: Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
W: There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Freud's mystic world of meaning needn't have us mystified
W: It's really very simple what the psyche tries to hide:
W: A thing is a phallic symbol if it's longer than it's wide
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on.

W: Late one night, sorrow come round
W: Scratching at my door
W: But I cut my hands
W: And break my back
W: Draggin' this bag of stones
W: Till they bury me down, beneath the ground
W: With the dust and rattlin' bones
W: 
W: [Shane] Left my home and left my love
W: [Kasey] Caught on a rusty nail
W: [Shane] Devil rose up, heavy with gold
W: [Kasey] My soul's not for sale
W: [Shane] Then a holy man in a house of God
W: [Kasey] He offered me a book of prayer
W: [Shane] And when I left my home I left my love

W: [Shane] Climb it up, bottom there
W: [Kasey] Earth's on the way back down
W: [Shane] When a sadness falls on the morning bird
W: [Kasey] Wonder what the day will bring

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Where am I today? I wish that I knew
W: Cause lookin' around there's no sign of you
W: I don't remember one jump or one leap
W: Just quiet steps away from your lead
W: 
W: I'm holding my heart out but clutching it too
W: Feeling this short of a love that we once knew
W: Calling this a home when it's not even close
W: I'm playing the role with nerves left exposed
W: 
W: Standing on a darkened stage
W: Stumbling through the lines
W: Others have excuses
W: I have my reasons why
W: We get distracted by the dreams of our own
W: But nobody's happy while feeling alone
W: And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
W: We lean another ladder against the wrong wall
W: 
W: And climb high to the highest rung
W: To shake fists at the sky
W: Others have excuses
W: I have my reasons why
W: With so much deception
W: It's hard not to wander away
W: It's hard not to wander away, it's hard not to wander away

W: Doesn't that hit too close to home

W: So that I do remember to never go that far
W: Could you leave me with a scar

C:The Audreys
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: If there’s one thing that I’ve noticed
W: Out of all the things I’ve seen
W: It’s that you can leave a footprint
W: In a place you’ve never been
W: And there’s barely time to look around
W: Before you have to leave
W: And a mark upon the skin
W: Is not enough to make you bleed
W: If there’s one thing that I’m keeping
W: Out of all the things I’ve found
W: It’s that the best way to be heard sometimes
W: Is not to make a sound
W: And the things we want the most
W: Fetch not a penny nor a pound
W: And all it takes to find your feet
W: Is just to stand your ground
W: If there’s one thing that I’m sure of
W: Out of all the things I know
W: It’s that you can keep on going fast
W: I’ll still be going slow
W: And falling’s not that hard
W: When you’re starting out so low
W: And drowning’s not that bad
W: If you breathe and just let go
W: Breathe and just let go…
W: (the wasted and the used things
W: The broken and abused things
W: All these small things
W: The treasured and the sacred things
W: The lost and the forsaken things
W: All these small things)

C:Michelle Shocked
B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Shaking hands and fingers that do tremble
W: Soldier's joy has been a bitter pill
W: Though in battle a brave man I resemble
W: Alone, I am a coward without will
W: 
W: Here's McGee from the great state of Missouri
W: To the ?Show-Me State Militia? I belong
W: And to judge from the pride on the Confederate side
W: I'd say five hundred thousand rebels can't be wrong
W: 
W: A rebel stand is no place for a traitor
W: A loveless union cannot bend us to her will
W: Cannot command the soldiers who now hate her
W: Nor demand a bounty of her generals
W: 
W: I took a rifle ball in my shoulder
W: But my entire body filled with pain
W: I waited with them all at the field hospital
W: Oh God, another shot of morphine
W: 
W: Soldier's joy, oh, what's the point in pleasure
W: When it's only meant to kill the pain?
W: Lay down my arms and take the coffin's measure
W: Or take up arms and send me out to fight again
W: 
W: Shaking hands, was I a coward, was I brave?
W: Shaking hands, I took the bitter pill
W: Tell the story on my grave, my soul they could not save
W: What the bullet could not kill, the needle will

W: Trees, they grow high and the leaves they do grow green
W: Many is the time my true love I've seen
W: Many an hour I have watched him all alone
W: He's young but he's daily growing
W: 
W: Father, dear, father you've done me great wrong
W: You've married me to a boy who is too young
W: I'm twice twelve and he is but fourteen
W: He's young but he's daily growing

W: Daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong
W: I have married you to a great lord's son
W: He'll make a lord for you to wait upon
W: He's young but he's daily growing
W: 
W: Father, dear father, if you see fit
W: We'll send him to college for one year yet
W: I'll tie blue ribbons all around his head
W: To let the maidens know that he's married
W: 
W: One day, I was looking o'er my father's castle wall
W: I spied all the boys aplaying with the ball
W: My own true love was the flower of them all
W: He's young but he's daily growing
W: 
W: At the age of fourteen, he was a married man
W: At the age of fifteen, the father of a son
W: At the age of sixteen, his grave it was green
W: And death had put an end to his growing

B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I am a lighthouse, worn by
W: the weather and the waves.
W: I keep my lamp lit, to warn
W: the sailors on their way.
W: 
W: I'll tell a story, paint
W: 
W: you a picture from my past.
W: I was so happy, but joy in
W: this life seldom lasts.
W: 
W: 
W: I had a keeper, he helped
W: 
W: me warn the ships at sea.
W: We had grown closer, 'till his
W: joy meant everything to me.
W: 
W: And he was to marry, a girl who
W: shone with beauty and light.
W: And they loved each other, and with
W: me watched the sunsets into night.
W: 
W: And the waves crashing around
W: 
W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: 
W: She'd had to leave us, my keeper
W: 
W: he prayed for a safe return.
W: But when the night came, the weather
W: to a raging storm had turned.
W: 
W: He watched her ship fight, but in vain
W: against the wild and terrible wave.
W: In me so helpless, as dashed
W: against the rock she met her end.
W: 
W: And the waves crashing around
W: 
W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: 
W: Then on the next day, my keeper
W: found her washed up on the SHORE.
W: He kissed her cold face, that
W: they'd be together soon he'd swore.
W: 
W: I saw him crying, watched as
W: he buried her in the sand.
W: And then he climbed my tower, and
W: off of the edge of me he ran.
W: 
W: And the waves crashing around
W: 
W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: I am a lighthouse, worn by
W: 
W: the weather and the waves.
W: And though I am empty, I still
W: warn the sailors on their way.

W: The scenes recalled by minute movement
W: And songs they fall from the backing tape
W: That certain texture, that certain smell
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: To lie in sweat on familiar sheets
W: In brick veneer on financed beds
W: In a room of silent HardieFlex
W: That certain texture, that certain smell
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: Brings home the heavy days
W: Brings home the the nighttime swell
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Out on the patio we'd sit
W: And the humidity we'd breathe
W: We'd watch the lightning crack over cane-fields
W: And laugh and think, "This is Australia"
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: The block is awkward, it faces west
W: Long diagonals and sloping, too
W: And in the distance, through the heat haze
W: In convoys of silence the cattle graze
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: That certain texture, that certain beat
W: Brings forth the nighttime heat
W: Cha-kow

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
W: I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
W: And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
W: He is looking out the window at somebody coming in
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: "It is always nice to see you," says the man behind the counter
W: To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
W: And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
W: And I'm pretending not to see them, and instead I pour the milk
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
W: Who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of
W: And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
W: When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me?
W: No, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection
W: And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
W: And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: Oh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
W: To the bells of the cathedral
W: I am thinking of your voice
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 6]
W: And of the midnight picnic once upon a time before the rain began
W: And I finish up my coffee
W: And it's time to catch the train

W: But when I start to try to tell you
W: That's when you have to tell me
W: "Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun"

W: I may be mad
W: I may be blind
W: I may be viciously unkind
W: But I can still read what you're thinking
W: And I've heard it said too many times
W: That you'd be better off
W: Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
W: This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
W: Let's go down to the water's edge
W: And we can cast away those doubts
W: Some things are better left unsaid

W: Turning inside out
W: Turning inside out

W: (Why?) This is the book I never read
W: These are the words I never said
W: This is the path I'll never tread
W: These are the dreams I'll dream instead
W: (Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
W: These are the tears, the tears we shed
W: This is the fear, this is the dread
W: These are the contents of my head
W: (Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
W: And this is what they represent
W: And this is how I feel
W: Do you know how I feel?
W: ‘Cause I don't think you know how I feel
W: I don't think you know what I fear
W: (Why?) I don't think you know what I fear

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: There was a Wild Colonial Boy, Jack Duggan was his name
W: He was born and raised in Ireland, in a place called Castlemain
W: He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
W: And dearly did his parents love, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: At the early age of eighteen years, he left his native home
W: And to Australia's sunny shore, he was inclined to roam
W: He robbed the rich, to help the poor, he shot Judge McEvoy
W: A terror to Australia was, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: One morning on the prairie, as Jack he rode along
W: A listening to the mocking bird, singing a cheerful song
W: Up rode three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
W: They all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: Surrender now, Jack Duggan, for you see we're three to one
W: Surrender in the Queen's high name, you are a plundering son
W: Jack drew two pistols from his belt and proudly waved them high
W: "I'll fight but not surrender, " said the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
W: And turning round to Davis, he received a mortal wound
W: A bullet pierced his proud young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy
W: And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy

W: 
W: I came upon a child of God
W: He was walking along the road
W: And I asked him where are you going
W: And this he told me
W: I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm *
W: I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band
W: I'm going to camp out on the land
W: I'm going to try an' get my soul free
W: 
W: We are stardust
W: We are golden
W: And we've got to get ourselves
W: Back to the garden
W: 
W: Then can I walk beside you
W: I have come here to lose the smog
W: And I feel to be a cog in something turning
W: Well maybe it is just the time of year
W: Or maybe it's the time of man
W: I don't know who I am
W: But you know life is for learning
W: 
W: We are stardust
W: We are golden
W: And we've got to get ourselves
W: Back to the garden
W: 
W: By the time we got to Woodstock
W: We were half a million strong
W: And everywhere there was song and celebration
W: And I dreamed I saw the bombers
W: Riding shotgun in the sky
W: And they were turning into butterflies
W: Above our nation
W: 
W: We are stardust
W: Billion year old carbon
W: We are golden
W: Caught in the devil's bargain
W: And we've got to get ourselves
W: back to the garden

W: And, whoa, my nights are so long
W: Where's my wife and family?
W: What if I die here?
W: Who'll be my role model
W: Now that my role model is gone, gone?"
W: He ducked back down the alley
W: With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
W: All along, along
W: There were incidents and accidents
W: There were hints and allegations

W: [Chorus]

W: Maybe it's the third world
W: Maybe it's his first time around
W: Doesn't speak the language
W: He holds no currency
W: He is a foreign man
W: He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
W: Cattle in the marketplace
W: Scatterlings and orphanages
W: He looks around, around
W: He sees angels in the architecture
W: Spinning in infinity
W: He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"
W:

W: Would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are (Ooo)
W: Or would you rather be a mule?
W: 
W: [Verse 1: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A mule is an animal with long funny ears
W: He kicks up at anything he hears
W: His back is brawny but his brain is weak
W: He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
W: And by the way, if you hate to go to school
W: You may grow up to be a mule
W: [Chorus 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: Or would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are, doo doo
W: Or would you rather be a pig?
W: 
W: [Verse 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
W: His shoes are a terrible disgrace
W: He has no manners when he eats his food
W: He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
W: But if you don't care a feather or a fig
W: You may grow up to be a pig
W: 
W: [Chorus 3: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: Or would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are
W: Or would you rather be a fish?
W: 
W: [Verse 3: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
W: He can't write his name or read a book
W: To fool the people is his only thought
W: And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
W: But then if that sort of life is what you wish
W: You may grow up to be a fish
W: You might also like

W: White Christmas

W: A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

W: [Outro: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
W: Everyday you'll meet quite a few
W: So you see it's all up to you (Ooo)
W: You can be better than you are (Ooo)
W: You could be swingin' on a star
W: 
W: Doo doo doo doo doo
W: Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo

B: mandira
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Walking along the banks of a river
W: Starts out narrow and ends up so wide
W: Somewhere along you will find the right step-stones
W: Sooner or later you’ll cross to the other side
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea
W: In between so much twisting and turning
W: Winding its way until it runs free
W: 
W: I don’t know where I’m going but I know how I’ll get there
W: I’ll follow the laughing water all the way down
W: I’ll build me a boat and I’ll float down the middle
W: Just let the current take me where I’m bound
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea
W: In between so much twisting and turning
W: Winding its way until it runs free
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: I left a friend back there on the mountain
W: Made a new friend on this long and winding stream
W: The water is wise so just let it take you
W: Just let it take you into your dream
W: 
W: When I was younger I asked lots of questions
W: I asked and I asked but no one seemed to hear
W: But I was the one who should have been listening
W: Now I know I have nothing to fear
W: 
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea
W: In between so much twisting and turning
W: Winding its way until is runs free

W: [Verse 1]
W: Hey mama, when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
W: I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
W: Take care into the hall and if you see my friends
W: Tell 'em I'm fine, not using nothing
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Almost burned out my eyes and threw my ears down to the floor
W: I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing
W: I stood there like a block of stone knowing all I had to know
W: And nothing more, man, that's nothing
W: [Verse 3]
W: 'Cause, brothers, our troubles are locked in each others arms
W: And you better pray that they never find you
W: 'Cause your back ain't strong enough for burdens double fold
W: They'd crush you down, down into nothing
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Being born is going blind and bowing down a thousand times
W: To echoes strung on pure temptation
W: Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things
W: And the only words that are worth remembering

W: I never saw rainbows in my wine
W: But now that your lips are burning mine
