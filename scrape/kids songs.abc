W: Yankee Doodle went to town
W: A-riding on a pony,
W: Stuck a feather in his cap
W: And called it macaroni'.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Yankee Doodle keep it up,
W: Yankee Doodle dandy,
W: Mind the music and the step,
W: And with the girls be handy.
W: 
W: Fath'r and I went down to camp,
W: Along with Captain Gooding,
W: And there we saw the men and boys
W: As thick as hasty pudding.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And there we saw a thousand men
W: As rich as Squire David,
W: And what they wasted every day,
W: I wish it could be saved.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: The 'lasses they eat it every day,
W: Would keep a house a winter;
W: They have so much, that I'll be bound,
W: They eat it when they've mind ter.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And there I see a swamping gun
W: Large as a log of maple,
W: Upon a deuced little cart,
W: A load for father's cattle.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And every time they shoot it off,
W: It takes a horn of powder,
W: and makes a noise like father's gun,
W: Only a nation louder.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: I went as nigh to one myself
W: As 'Siah's inderpinning;
W: And father went as nigh again,
W: I thought the deuce was in him.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: Cousin Simon grew so bold,
W: I thought he would have cocked it;
W: It scared me so I shrinked it off
W: And hung by father's pocket.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And Cap'n Davis had a gun,
W: He kind of clapt his hand on't
W: And stuck a crooked stabbing iron
W: Upon the little end on't
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And there I see a pumpkin shell
W: As big as mother's bason,
W: And every time they touched it off
W: They scampered like the nation.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: I see a little barrel too,
W: The heads were made of leather;
W: They knocked on it with little clubs
W: And called the folks together.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: And there was Cap'n Washington,
W: And gentle folks about him;
W: They say he's grown so 'tarnal proud
W: He will not ride without em'.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: He got him on his meeting clothes,
W: Upon a slapping stallion;
W: He sat the world along in rows,
W: In hundreds and in millions.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: The flaming ribbons in his hat,
W: They looked so tearing fine, ah,
W: I wanted dreadfully to get
W: To give to my Jemima.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: I see another snarl of men
W: A digging graves they told me,
W: So 'tarnal long, so 'tarnal deep,
W: They 'tended they should hold me.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: It scared me so, I hooked it off,
W: Nor stopped, as I remember,
W: Nor turned about till I got home,
W: Locked up in mother's chamber.
W: 
W: Chorus
