W: Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
W: That saved a wretch; like me!
W: I once was lost, but now am found,
W: Was blind, but now I see.
W: 
W: ’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
W: And grace my fears relieved;
W: How precious did that grace appear
W: The hour I first believed!
W: 
W: The Lord hath promised good to me,
W: His word my hope secures;
W: He will my shield and portion be
W: As long as life endures.
W: 
W: When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
W: Bright shining as the sun,
W: We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
W: Than when we first begun.

W: My thoughts today,	 though I'm	 far away,
W: Dwell	 on Tyrconnell's	 shore,
W: The	 salt sea air	 and the	 colleens fair,
W: Of	 lovely	 green Gwee	dore.
W: There's a	 flower there, bey	ond compare,
W: That I'll	 treasure	 ever	more,
W: That	 grand colleen,	 in her	 gown of green,
W: She's the	 Rose of	 Aranmore.
W: 
W: 
W: I've travelled far 'neath the northern star,
W: Since the day I said goodbye,
W: And seen many maids in the golden glades
W: Beneath a tropic sky,
W: There's a vision in my reverie,
W: I always will adore,
W: That grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.
W: 
W: 
W: But soon I will return again
W: To the scenes I loved so well,
W: Where many an Irish lad and lass
W: Their tales of love do tell;
W: The silvery dunes and blue lagoons,
W: Along the Rosses' shore
W: And that grand colleen in her gown of green,
W: She's the Rose of Aranmore.

W: There's a fairmer up in Cairnie, that's kent frae far an' wide
W: Tae be the great Drumdelgie by yonder Deveronside.
W: Noo, the fairmer o' you muckle toon, he is baith hard an' sair,
W: An' the cauldest day that ever blaws, his servants get their share.
W: 
W: At five o'clock we quickly rise and hurry doon the stair;
W: It's there tae corn oor horses, likewise tae straik their hair.
W: Syne, after workin' half an hour, each tae the kitchen goes;
W: It's there to get oor breakfast, which is generally brose.
W: 
W: Noo we hadna gotten oor brose weel supped, an' gi'en oor pints a tie,
W: When the foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, the hour is drawin' nigh!”
W: At six o'clock the mill's put on, tae gi'e us a' strait wark;
W: It tak's four o' us tae mak' her, till ye could wring oor sark.
W: 
W: But when daylicht begins tae peep, and the sky begins tae clear,
W: The foreman he cries: “Noo, me lads, ye'll bide nae langer here,
W: It's six o' you will gae tae the ploo, twa will ca' the neeps,
W: And the owsen they'll be after ye when they get on their feet!”
W: 
W: But lang ere we were gannin' forth and turnin' oot tae yoke,
W: The snaw cam' on sae thick and fast that we were like tae choke.
W: The frost it bein' so very bad, the ploo she widna go;
W: Aye, and so our cairtin days commenced among the frost an' snaw.
W: 
W: Oor horses bein' sae young and sma', the shafts they widna fill,
W: And they oft required the saddler tae help ‘em up the hill.
W: But we will sing oor horses' praise, tho' they be young and sma',
W: For they far outshine the Broadlands anes that gang sae full an' braw.
W: 
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, for I maun gang awa'.
W: Oh, fare the weel, Drumdelgie, your weepie' weather an' a'.
W: Noo, fare thee weel, Drumdelgie, an' I bid ye a' adieu,
W: An' I leave ye as I got ye, a maist unceevil crew.

W: We'll rise and give them a blow, a blow

W: Oh! our soldier lads looked stout, looked stout
W: With their tartan kilts and all, and all
W: With their bonnets and feathers and glittering gear
W: And bagpipes sounding loud and clear
W: 
W: Will they all return to their own dear glen?
W: Will they all return our Highland men?
W: Second sighted Sandy looked full of woe
W: And mothers cried when they marched away

W: Oh! what is foremost of all, of all
W: Bonnie Charlie the King of us all, hurrah!
W: With his hundred pipers, and all, and all
W: 
W: His bonnet and feathers he's waving high
W: His prancing steed almost seems to fly
W: The north wind plays with his curly hair
W: While the pipers play with a strange flare
W: 
W: (chorus)
W: 
W: The Esk was swollen so red and so deep
W: But shoulder to shoulder the brave lads keep;
W: Two thousand swam over to fell English ground
W: And danced themselves dry to the bagpipe's sound
W: 
W: Dumfounded the English saw, they saw
W: Dumfounded they heard the blow, the blow
W: Dumfounded they all ran away, away
W: From the hundred pipers and all, and all

W: O see the fleet-foot host of men, who march with faces drawn,
W: From farmstead and from fishers' cot, along the banks of Ban;
W: They come with vengeance in their eyes. Too late! Too late are
W: they,
W: For young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: Oh Ireland, Mother Ireland, you love them still the best
W: The fearless brave who fighting fall upon your hapless breast,
W: But never a one of all your dead more bravely fell in fray,
W: Than he who marches to his fate on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Up the narrow street he stepped, so smiling, proud and young.
W: About the hemp-rope on his neck, the golden ringlets clung;
W: There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, fearless and brave are
W: they,
W: As young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome
W: today.
W: 
W: When last this narrow street he trod, his shining pike in hand
W: Behind him marched, in grim array, a earnest stalwart band.
W: To Antrim town! To Antrim town, he led them to the fray,
W: But young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: The grey coat and its sash of green were brave and stainless then,
W: A banner flashed beneath the sun over the marching men;
W: The coat hath many a rent this noon, the sash is torn away,
W: And Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: Oh, how his pike flashed in the sun! Then found a foeman's heart,
W: Through furious fight, and heavy odds he bore a true man's part
W: And many a red-coat bit the dust before his keen pike-play,
W: But Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.
W: 
W: There's never a one of all your dead more bravely died in fray
W: Than he who marches to his fate in Toomebridge town today;
W: True to the last! True to the last, he treads the upwards way,
W: And young Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today.

W: The morn was breaking bright and fair,
W: The lark sang in the sky,
W: When the maid she bound her goIden hair,
W: With a blythe glance in her eye;
W: For, who beyond the gay green-wood,
W: Was a-waiting her with joy,
W: Oh, who but her gallant Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: Up on the mountains high.
W: 
W: Full often in the dawning hour,
W: Full oft in twilight brown
W: He met the maid in the woodland bower,
W: Where the stream comes foaming down
W: For they were faithful in a love
W: No wars could e'er destroy.
W: No tyrant's law touched Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: "Dear love", she said, "l am so afraid,
W: For the foeman's force and you
W: They've tracked you in the lowland plain
W: And all the valley through.
W: My kinsmen frown when you are named
W: Your life they would destroy
W: 'Beware,' they say, 'of Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy' "
W: 
W: "Fear not, fear not, sweetheart," he cried,
W: "Fear not the foe for me
W: No chain shall fall, whate'er betide,
W: On the arm that would be free!
W: Oh, leave your cruel kin and come,
W: When the lark is in the sky.
W: And it's with my gun I'll guard you,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy."
W: 
W: The morn has come, she rose and fled
W: From her cruel kin and home;
W: And bright the wood, and rosy red,
W: And the tumbling torrent's foam.
W: But the mist came down and the tempest roared,
W: And did all around destroy;
W: And a pale, drowned bride met Renardine,
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.
W: 
W: An outlawed man in a land forlorn,
W: He scorned to turn and fly,
W: But he kept the cause of freedom safe
W: On the mountains of Pomeroy.

W: In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
W: I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
W: As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
W: For so were her father and mother before
W: And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: She died of a fever and no one could save her
W: And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
W: Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: 
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
W: Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
W: A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!

W: [Verse 1]
W: When the blackbird in the Spring
W: 'Neath the willow tree
W: Sat and rocked, I heard him sing
W: Singing Aura Lea!
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid of golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: [Verse 2]
W: In thy blush the rose was born
W: Music when you spake
W: In thine azure eye the morn
W: Sparkling, seemed to break
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and life return with thee
W: And swallows in the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Aura Lea! The bird may flee
W: The willow's golden hair
W: Swing through winter fitfully
W: On the stormy air
W: Yet if thy blue eyes I see
W: Gloom will soon depart
W: For to me, sweet Aura Lea
W: Is sunshine through the heart
W: 
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: When the mistletoe was green
W: Midst the winter's snows
W: Sunshine in thy face was seen
W: Kissing lips of rose
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Take my golden ring
W: Love and light return with thee
W: And swallows with the Spring
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Aura Lea!, Aura Lea!
W: Maid with golden hair
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air
W: Sunshine came along with thee
W: And swallows in the air

W: As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
W: How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
W: Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
W: I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here
W: 
W: I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
W: Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold
W: In letters made of gold my love, believe me when I say
W: You are the one that I will adore until my dying day
W: 
W: The blackest crow that ever flew would surely turn to white
W: If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
W: Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
W: If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
W: 
W: And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
W: And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
W: And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
W: That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee

W: I'm lonesome since I crossed the hill,
W: And over the moorland sedgy,
W: Such heavy thoughts my heart do fill,
W: Since parting from my Sally.
W: I seek no more the fine and gay,
W: For each just does remind me
W: How sweet the hours I passed away,
W: With the girl I left behind me.
W: 
W: O ne'er shall I forget that night,
W: The stars were bright above me,
W: And gently lent their silvery light
W: When first she vowed to love me.
W: But now I'm bound to Brighton camp -
W: Kind heaven then pray guide me,
W: And send me safely back again,
W: To the girl I left behind me.
W: 
W: Her golden hair in ringlets fair,
W: Her eyes like diamonds shining,
W: Her slender waist, her heavenly face,
W: That leaves my heart still pining.
W: Ye gods above oh hear my prayer,
W: To my beauteous fair to find me,
W: And send me safely back again,
W: to the girl I left behind me.

W: High in the belfry the old sexton stands

W: Fix'd is his gaze as by some magic spell
W: Till he hears the distant murmur
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Chorus
W: Ring the bell, watchman! ring! ring! ring!
W: Yes, yes! the good news is now on the wing.
W: Yes, yes! they come and with tiding to tell
W: Glorious and blessed tidings. Ring, ring the bell!
W: 
W: Baring his long silver locks to the breeze
W: First for a moment he drops on his knees
W: Then with a vigor that few could excel
W: Answers he the welcome bidding
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Hear! from the hilltop, the first signal gun
W: Thunders the word that some great deed is done
W: Hear! thro' the valley the long echoes swell
W: Ever and anon repeating
W: Ring, ring the bell
W: 
W: Bonfires are blazing and rockets ascend
W: No meagre triumph such tokens portend
W: Shout! shout! my brothers for "all, all is well!"
W: 'Tis the universal chorus
W: Ring, ring the bell

W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
W: Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.
W: 
W: As I came down the new cut road,
W: Met Mr. Bullfrog, met Miss Toad
W: And every time Miss Toad would sing,
W: Old Bullfrog cut a pigeon wing.
W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
W: Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.
W: 
W: Oh I jumped in the seat and I gave a little yell
W: The horses ran away, broke the wagon all to hell
W: Sugar in the gourd and honey in the horn
W: I never been so happy since the day I was born.
W: Turkey in the straw, turkey in the hay,
W: Roll 'em up and twist 'em up a high tuckahaw
W: And twist 'em up a tune called Turkey in the Straw.

W: In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn’t a shilling.
W: His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
W: Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
W: Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
W: There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea.
W: Nolans and Dolans and all the O’Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
W: While songs went round as plenty as water,
W: The harps that are sounded through Tara’s old hall,
W: Biddie Grey and the rat catcher’s daughter singing away at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
W: Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
W: Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
W: How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
W: I spent six months in Brook’s Academy learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
W: Dancing around in their couples and groups.
W: An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
W: He put his boot through Miss Finnerty’s hoops.
W: She fell down in a faint and cried, ‘Holy murder!’
W: Called her brothers and gathered them all.
W: Carmody swore he’d go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Boys oh boys ’tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
W: I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
W: Moloney the piper was near gettin’ smothered.
W: They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
W: Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS

W: As I walked down through Chatham Street
W: A fair maid I did meet
W: She asked me to see her home--
W: She lived in Bleecker Street
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: And when we got to Bleecker Street
W: We stopped at forty-four
W: Her mother and her sister there
W: To meet her at the door
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: And when I got inside the house
W: The drinks were passed around
W: The liquor was so awful strong
W: My head went round and round
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: And then we had another drink
W: Before we sat to eat
W: The liquor was so awful strong
W: I quickly fell asleep
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: When I awoke next morning
W: I had an aching head
W: There was I, Jack all alone
W: Stark naked in me bed
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: My gold watch and my pocketbook
W: And lady friend were gone;
W: And there was I, Jack all alone
W: Stark naked in the room
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: On looking round this little room
W: There's nothing I could see
W: But a woman's shift and apron
W: That were no use to me
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: With a flour barrel for a suit of clothes
W: Down Cherry Street forlorn
W: There Martin Churchill took me in
W: And sent me 'round Cape Horn
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My dear Annie
W: Oh, you New York girls, Can't you dance the polka?
W: 
W: To me a-weigh, you Santy, My honey , My dear Annie

W: Early one day the sun wouldn't shine
W: I was walking down the street not feeling too fine
W: I saw two old men with a bottle between 'em
W: And this was the song that I heard them singing
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: Well I stopped by the steps where they was sitting
W: And I couldn't believe how drunk they were getting
W: I said "old men, have you been drinking long?"
W: They said "just long enough to be singing this song"
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: Well they passed me the bottle and I took a little sip
W: And it felt so good I just couldn't quit
W: I drank some more and next thing I knew
W: There were three of us sitting there singing this tune
W: 
W: Lord preserve us and protect us,
W: We've been drinking whiskey 'fore breakfast
W: 
W: One by one everybody in the town
W: They heard our ruckus and they all came down
W: And pretty soon all the streets were ringing
W: With the sound of the whole town laughing and singing

W: Oh once upon a time in Arkansas
W: An old man sat in his little cabin door
W: And fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear
W: A jolly old tune that he played by ear
W: 
W: It was raining hard but the fiddler didn’t care
W: He sawed away at the popular air
W: Though his rooftop leaked like a waterfall
W: That didn’t seem to bother the old man at all
W: 
W: A traveler was riding by that day
W: And stopped to hear him a-fiddling away
W: The cabin was afloat and his feet were wet
W: But the old man still didn’t seem to fret
W: 
W: So the stranger said Now the way it seems to me
W: You’d better mend your roof said he
W: But the old man said as he played away
W: I couldn’t mend it now it’s a rainy day
W: 
W: The traveler replied that’s all quite true
W: But this I think is the thing for you to do
W: Get busy on a day that is fair and bright
W: Then patch the old roof till it’s good and tight
W: 
W: But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel
W: And tapped the ground with his leathery heel
W: Get along said he for you give me a pain
W: My cabin never leaks when it doesn’t rain

W: In the town of Athy, one Jeremy Lanigan battered away till he hadn’t a shilling.
W: His father died, made him a man again, left him a farm and ten acres of ground.
W: Myself, to be sure, got invitations for the boys and girls I might ask.
W: Having been asked, friends and relations danced like bees around a sweet cask.
W: There was lashings of drink wine for the ladies, potatoes and cake bacon and tea.
W: Nolans and Dolans and all the O’Gradys, courting the girls and dancing away.
W: While songs went round as plenty as water,
W: The harps that are sounded through Tara’s old hall,
W: Biddie Grey and the rat catcher’s daughter singing away at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, six long months doing nothing at all,
W: Six long months I spent in Dublin, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again. I stepped out and she stepped in again.
W: She stepped out, I stepped in again, learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: They were doing all kinds of nonsensical dances all around in a whirligig.
W: Julie and I soon banished their nonsense,
W: Out on the floor for a reel and a jig.
W: How the girls all got mad at me for they thought the ceilings would fall.
W: I spent six months in Brook’s Academy learning to dance for Lanigan’s ball.
W: Well the boys were merry and the girls all hearty
W: Dancing around in their couples and groups.
W: An accident happened; Terence McCarthy,
W: He put his boot through Miss Finnerty’s hoops.
W: She fell down in a faint and cried, ‘Holy murder!’
W: Called her brothers and gathered them all.
W: Carmody swore he’d go no further till he got revenge at Lanigan’s ball.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Boys oh boys ’tis then there was ructions. I got a belt from Phelim Mc Hugh.
W: I replied to his introduction, kicked up a terrible hullabaloo.
W: Moloney the piper was near gettin’ smothered.
W: They leapt on his pipes, bellows, chanter and all.
W: Boys and girls all got entangled and that put an end to Lanigan’s ball.

W: Are you going to Scarborough Fair?
W: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
W: Remember me to the one who lives there,
W: For once she was a true love of mine.
W: 
W: Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
W: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
W: Sewn without seams or fine needlework,
W: If she would be a true love of mine.
W: 
W: Tell her to wash it in yonder well,
W: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
W: Where never spring water or rain ever fell,
W: And she shall be a true lover of mine.
W: 
W: Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,
W: Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
W: Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,
W: Then she shall be a true lover of mine.
W: 
W: Now he has asked me questions three,

W: I hope he'll answer as many for me

W: I don't believe in Angels with wings
W: Or a choir invisible that does nothing but sing
W: or golden light around a Boticeli smile
W: 'cause you can't call them up when you're desperate to dial
W: and Gabriel's playing that trumpet all day
W: must make it hard to hear people pray
W: but I do believe in Angels on earth who go about their business with no thought of its worth.
W: 
W: They're my kind of Angel...
W: 
W: Are you looking in the garden? are you looking in the Sky?
W: Angels aren't marble and Angels can't fly
W: but once in a while they turn up on time with tattoos and spanners and a face made for crime.
W: They're waiting on tables, they're working in labs
W: They're delivering papers and babies in cabs
W: They do what they can but not always what they should
W: My kind of Angel is bad and is good.
W: Everyone's a devil, though the good book may scoff
W: but a devil is an angel on a rostered day off
W: 
W: They're my kind of Angel....
W: 
W: I've examined your body and you don't have wings.
W: You don't have a halo and you don't always sing
W: but once on a blue moon you turned up on time
W: and killed the villain in my pantomime
W: You're my kind of Angel
W: You're my kind of Angel
W: once on a blue moon you turned up on time
W: and killed the villain in my pantomime

W: I ache for the touch of your lips, dear
W: But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
W: You can raise welts Like nobody else
W: As we dance to the Masochism Tango
W: 
W: Let our love be a flame, not an ember
W: Say it's me that you want to dismember
W: Blacken my eye Set fire to my tie
W: As we dance to the Masochism Tango
W: 
W: At your command
W: Before you here I stand
W: My heart is in my hand
W: It's here that I must be
W: 
W: My heart entreats
W: Just hear those savage beats
W: And go put on your cleats
W: And come and trample me
W: 
W: Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
W: That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
W: My soul is on fire It's aflame with desire
W: Which is why I perspire when we tango
W: 
W: You caught my nose
W: In your left castanet, love
W: I can feel the pain yet, love
W: Every time I hear drums
W: 
W: And I envy the rose
W: That you held in your teeth, love
W: With the thorns underneath, love
W: Sticking into your gums
W: 
W: Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
W: The last time I needed twenty stitches
W: To sew up the gash That you made with your lash
W: As we danced to the Masochism Tango
W: 
W: Bash in my brain
W: And make me scream with pain
W: Then kick me once again

W: 
W: I know too well
W: I'm underneath your spell
W: So, darling, if you smell
W: Something burning, it's my heart
W: 
W: Take your cigarette from its holder
W: And burn your initials in my shoulder
W: Fracture my spine And swear that you're mine
W: As we dance to the Maso-chism Tango

W: On Raglan Road of an autumn day
W: I saw her first and knew
W: That her dark hair would weave a snare
W: That I might one day rue
W: I saw the danger and I passed
W: Along the enchanted way
W: And I said let grief be a fallen leaf
W: At the dawning of the day
W: 
W: On Grafton Street in November
W: We tripped lightly along the ledge
W: Of a deep ravine where can be seen
W: The worth of passion's pledge
W: The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
W: And I'm not making hay
W: Oh I love too much and by such by such
W: Is happiness thrown away
W: 
W: I gave her gifts of the mind
W: I gave her the secret signs
W: That known to the artists who have known
W: The true gods of sound and stone
W: And word and tint to without stint
W: I gave her poems to say
W: With her own name there
W: And her own dark hair
W: Like clouds over fields of May
W: 
W: On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
W: I see her walking now
W: Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
W: That I had loved not as I should
W: A creature made of clay
W: When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
W: His wings at the dawn of day

W: [Verse 1]
W: Now I've heard there was a secret chord
W: That David played, and it pleased the Lord
W: But you don't really care for music, do ya?
W: It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W: The minor fall, the major lift
W: The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Your faith was strong but you needed proof
W: You saw her bathing on the roof
W: Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
W: She tied you to a kitchen chair
W: She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
W: And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: You say I took the name in vain
W: I don't even know the name
W: But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
W: There's a blaze of light in every word
W: It doesn't matter which you heard
W: The holy or the broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: I did my best, it wasn't much
W: I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
W: I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
W: And even though it all went wrong
W: I'll stand before the lord of song
W: With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Baby, I've been here before
W: I know this room, I've walked this floor
W: I used to live alone before I knew you
W: And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
W: Love is not a victory march
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: There was a time you let me know
W: What's really going on below
W: But now you never show it to me, do you?
W: And remember when I moved in you
W: The holy dove was moving too
W: And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Maybe there's a God above
W: But all I've ever learned from love
W: Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
W: And it's not a cry that you hear at night
W: It's not somebody who's seen the light
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

W: And the melodies and the high notes ringing,
W: And the hoot-owl cries over everything,
W: And the blackbird disagrees.
W: 
W: Singing in the night time singing in the day,
W: And the little duck quacks and he's on his way,
W: And the otter hasn't got much to say,
W: And the porcupine talks to himself.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: Dogs and the cats, they take up the middle,
W: Where the honeybee hums and the cricket fiddles,
W: The donkey brays and the pony neighs,
W: And the old gray badger sighs.
W: 
W: Listen to the bass its the one on the bottom,
W: Where the bullfrog croaks and the hippopotamus,
W: Moans and groans with a big to-do,
W: And the old cow just goes moo.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: Its a simple song little song everywhere,
W: By the ox and the fox and the grizzly bear,
W: The dopey alligator and the hawk above,
W: The sly old weasel and the turtle dove.

W: [Verse 1]
W: A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
W: Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
W: Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade
W: Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
W: 
W: Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gimme a heart attack"
W: He's underneath the window
W: She's singing, "Hey la, my boyfriend's back
W: You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that
W: Anyway, what ya gonna do about it?"
W: 
W: [Chorus 1]
W: "Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
W: And I bet, when you exploded into my heart
W: And I forget, I forget
W: The movie song
W: When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
W: Juliet"
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
W: Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
W: And I dreamed your dream for you, and now your dream is real
W: How can you look at me as I was just another one of your deals?
W: 
W: Well you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
W: You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
W: You promised me everything
W: You promised me thick and thin, yeah
W: Now you just say, "Oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him"
W: 
W: [Chorus 2]
W: "Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
W: You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
W: There's a place for us
W: (You know the movie song)
W: When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
W: Juliet"
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: "I can't do the talk like they talk on the TV
W: And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
W: I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
W: I can't do anything except be in love with you
W: 
W: And all I do is miss you, and the way we used to be
W: All I do is keep the beat and the bad company
W: And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
W: Juliet, I'd do the stars with you any time"
W: 
W: [Chorus 2]
W: "Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
W: You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
W: There's a place for us
W: (You know the movie song)
W: When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
W: Juliet"
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: And a lovestruck Romeo sings the streets a serenade
W: Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
W: Finds a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade
W: Says something like, "You and me babe, how about it?"
W: "You and me babe, how about it?"

W: Pictures of uncommon nature, painted by a masters hand
W: Draw me ever on life's journey, rendered thus to understand
W: 
W: As a songbird that is fallen, only to regain the sky
W: From this frozen shadow valley, they must weary fly
W: 
W: Love is from no distance calling, faithful as the rising sun
W: Warms the bitter heart and heartache, till the east of Eden's gone
W: Clouds of fear and misconception, wax and wane as if the moon
W: So is in a sense forsaken, till the will of God be known

W: 
W: Oh, the year was 1778
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: A letter of marque came from the King
W: To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: Oh Elcid Barrett, cried the town
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: For twenty brave men all fishermen who
W: Would make for him the Antelope's crew
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She'd a list to the port and and her sails in rags
W: And the cook in scuppers with the staggers and jags
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: On the King's birthday we put to sea
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: We were ninety-one days to Montego Bay
W: Pumping like madmen all the way
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: On the ninety-sixth day we sailed again
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
W: With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Yankee lay low down with gold
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
W: But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: Then at length we stood two cables away
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Our cracked four-pounders made an awful din
W: But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
W: And the main truck carried off both me legs
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers
W: 
W: So here I lay in my twenty-third year
W: How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
W: It's been six years since we sailed away
W: And I just made Halifax yesterday
W: 
W: God damn them all
W: I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold
W: We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
W: Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
W: The last of Barrett's Privateers

W: I don't know much, when I knew less
W: And I was heartbroke for the first time
W: I was drowning in my tears
W: I went looking for a lifeline
W: Trying to find some comfort
W: A simple tender touch
W: Searching for some little cure
W: That would not cost too much
W: And I could hear that produce wagon on the street
W: I could hear that farmer singing
W: As I cried myself to sleep
W: 
W: I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound
W: Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town
W: I got okra, enough to choke ya
W: Beans of every kind
W: If hungry is what's eatin' you
W: I'll sell you peace of mind
W: But this ain't what you came to hear me say
W: And I hate to disappoint you
W: But I got no love today
W: I got no love today
W: I got no love today
W: No love today
W: 
W: I could not love to save myself
W: From lonesome desperation
W: Everything I thought was love
W: Was worthless imitation
W: My concept of commitment
W: Was to take all you could give
W: I thought the cheapest thrills I loved
W: Were teachin' me to live
W: But nothin' seemed to last or see me through
W: Nothin' but that little song
W: That I still sing for you
W: 
W: I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound
W: Sweet corn, mirleton, mo' better than in town
W: I got okra, enough to choke ya
W: Beans of every kind
W: If hungry is what's eatin' you
W: I'll sell you peace of mind
W: But this ain't what you came to hear me say
W: And I hate to disappoint you
W: But I got no love today
W: I got no love today
W: I got no love today
W: No love today
W: 
W: No love today, none tomorrow
W: Not now, not forever
W: You can't see what comes for free
W: I think you much too clever
W: For your own good I will tell you
W: What's right before your eyes
W: Intelligence is no defense
W: Against what this implies
W: In the end no one will sell you what you need
W: You can't buy it off the shelf
W: You got to grow it from the seed
W: 
W: I got ba-na-na, watermelon, peaches by the pound

W: I see the clouds are drawing and the sun has gone away.
W: It fills me with foreboding cos I want the sun to stay
W: The sun it soaks right through me washing aches and pains away.
W: The rain it does as well, but it leaves me feeling grey.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Bring on the sun, let it drive away the cold and dampness.
W: Bring on the sun, drive away the rain.
W: Bring on the sun, let it fill my heart with gladness.
W: Bring on the sun, let it's joy into my day.
W: 
W: In the summer time I like to swim and walk and splash and sing.
W: But when the winter comes it brings a deadening within.
W: The cold it takes my fire, leaves me just a burning glow.
W: Till the sun it feeds the ashes and returns the vital flow.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: In the winter time it's nice to snuggle warm inside your bed.
W: With a raging fire going and a roof above your head.
W: But when the spring it starts to warm and makes it good to be outside.
W: I feel my spirit rising, know it's good to be alive.

W: Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
W: And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
W: Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
W: Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day  is  done
W: 
W: Oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song
W: And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
W: Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
W: Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this  day  is  done
W: 
W: Come by the hills to the land where legend re-mains
W: Where stories of old fill the heart and may yet come a-gain

W: A holiday, a holiday
W: And the first one of the year
W: Lord Donald's wife came into the church
W: The gospel for to hear
W: 
W: And when the meeting it was done
W: She cast her eyes about
W: And there she saw little Matty Groves
W: Walking in the crowd
W: 
W: "Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: Come home with me tonight
W: Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: And sleep with me 'til light"
W: "Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home
W: And sleep with you tonight
W: By the rings on your fingers I can tell
W: You are Lord Donald's wife"
W: 
W: "What if I am Lord Donald's wife?
W: Lord Donald's not at home
W: He is out in the far cornfields
W: Bringing the yearlings home"
W: 
W: And a servant who was standing by
W: And hearing what was said
W: He swore Lord Donald he would know
W: Before the sun would set
W: 
W: And in his hurry to carry the news
W: He bent his breast and ran
W: And when he came to the broad millstream
W: He took off his shoes and swam
W: 
W: Little Matty Groves, he lay down
W: And took a little sleep
W: When he awoke, Lord Donald
W: Was standing at his feet
W: 
W: Saying "How do you like my feather bed
W: And how do you like my sheets?
W: How do you like my lady
W: Who lies in your arms asleep?"
W: 
W: "Oh, well I like your feather bed
W: And well I like your sheets
W: But better I like your lady gay
W: Who lies in my arms asleep"
W: 
W: "Well, get up, get up," Lord Donald cried
W: "Get up as quick as you can
W: It'll never be said in fair England
W: I slew a naked man"
W: 
W: "Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up
W: I can't get up for my life
W: For you have two long beaten swords
W: And I not a pocket knife"
W: 
W: "Well it's true I have two beaten swords
W: And they cost me deep in the purse
W: But you will have the better of them
W: And I will have the worse
W: 
W: And you will strike the very first blow
W: And strike it like a man
W: I will strike the very next blow
W: And I'll kill you if I can"
W: 
W: So Matty struck the very first blow
W: And he hurt Lord Donald sore
W: Lord Donald struck the very next blow
W: And Matty struck no more
W: 
W: And then Lord Donald he took his wife
W: And he sat her on his knee
W: Saying "Who do you like the best of us
W: Matty Groves or me?"
W: 
W: And then up spoke his own dear wife
W: Never heard to speak so free
W: "I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips
W: Than you or your finery".
W: 
W: Lord Donald he jumped up
W: And loudly he did bawl
W: He struck his wife right through the heart
W: And pinned her against the wall
W: 
W: "A grave, a grave," Lord Donald cried
W: "To put these lovers in
W: But bury my lady at the top
W: For she was of noble kin”

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
W: There are frail forms fainting at the door:
W: Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say –
W: Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W: 
W: Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
W: While we all sup sorrow with the poor:
W: There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
W: With a worn heart whose better days are o’er:
W: Though her voice would be merry, ’tis sighing all the day –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days have lingered around my cab in door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
W: ‘ Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore,
W: ‘ Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave, –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: ​Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

W: I was a kid like a mother's sigh,
W: I'd watch those freight trains rushing by,
W: I'd hear that whistle blow.

W: A big freight truck a shifting gear ,
W: It's what I need to know.

W: But they ended up by sleeping
W: In a doorway
W: By the bodegas and the lights on
W: Upper Broadway
W: Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes

W: [Verse 1]
W: Well, I recall his parting words
W: Must I accept his fate?
W: Or take myself far from this place
W: I thought I heard a black bell toll
W: A little bird did sing
W: Man has no choice when he wants everything
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: [Verse 2]
W: Man goes beyond his own decision
W: Gets caught up in the mechanism
W: Of swindlers who act like kings
W: And brokers who break everything
W: The dark of night was swiftly fading
W: Close to the dawn of day
W: Why would I want him just to lose him again?
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride
W: We'll rise above the scarlet tide
W: That trickles down through the mountain
W: And separates the widow from the bride

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: Living on the road, my friend
W: Was gonna keep you free and clean
W: And now you wear your skin like iron
W: Your breath as hard as kerosene
W: You weren't your momma's only boy
W: But her favorite one, it seems
W: She began to cry when you said goodbye
W: And sank into your dreams
W: 
W: Pancho was a bandit boy
W: His horse was fast as polished steel
W: He wore his gun outside his pants
W: For all the honest world to feel
W: Pancho met his match, you know
W: On the deserts down in Mexico
W: Nobody heard his dying words
W: But that's the way it goes
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: They only let him slip away
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Lefty, he can't sing the blues
W: All night long like he used to
W: The dust that Pancho bit down South
W: Ended up in Lefty's mouth
W: The day they laid poor Pancho low
W: Lefty split for Ohio
W: Where he got the bread to go
W: There ain't nobody knows
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: We only let him slip away
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: The poets tell how Pancho fell
W: And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
W: The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
W: And so the story ends, we're told
W: Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
W: But save a few for Lefty too
W: He only did what he had to do
W: And now he's growing old
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: All the Federales say
W: We could've had him any day
W: They only let him go so long
W: Out of kindness, I suppose
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: A few gray Federales say
W: They could've had him any day
W: They only let him go so long
W: Out of kindness, I suppose

W: Those other years, the dusty years
W: We drove the big hers through
W: I tried to forget the miles we rode
W: And spanish johnny too
W: He'd sit beside a water ditch when all this herd was in
W: And he'd never harm a child but sing to his mandolin
W: 
W: The old talk, the old ways, and the dealin' of our game
W: But spanish johnny never spoke, but sing a song of spain
W: And his talk with men was vicious talk
W: When he was drunk on gin
W: Ah, but those were golden things he said to his mandolin
W: 
W: We had to stand, we tried to judge, we had to stop him then
W: For the hand so gentle to a child had killed so many men
W: He died a hard death long ago before the road come in
W: And the night before he swung he sung to his mandolin
W: 
W: Well, we carried him out in the mornin' sun
W: A man that done no good
W: And we lowered him down in the cold clay
W: Stuck in a cross of wood
W: And a letter we wrote to his kinfolk
W: To tell them where he'd been
W: And we shipped it out to mexico, along with his mandolin

C:Woody Guthrie

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
W: Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
W: She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
W: And when the Legion boys come 'round
W: She always stood her ground.
W: 
W: Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
W: I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
W: Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
W: I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.
W: 
W: This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
W: She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
W: She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
W: She'd show her card to the National Guard
W: And this is what she'd say
W: 
W: You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
W: Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
W: Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
W: A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

W: The Classical Greek
W: 
W: Now listen a while and I'll sing you some praises,
W: Recall faded glories and honor the dead;
W: And I hope that a smile will crack all of your faces,
W: And care and all worry escape from your head,
W: I'll sing of some lads of exceptional quality,
W: All of them geniuses, truly unique;
W: And a gambler who'd bet the last bill in his wallet
W: Would wager I sing of the classical Greek,
W: 
W: For philosophy mighty and pure cogitation
W: There's none to compare to the classical Greek;
W: If thinking were drinking and jollification,
W: An ocean of booze wouldn't last them a week.
W: Democrates, Plato, and good old Pythagoras,
W: Socrates, Zeno, Protagoras too;
W: Don't forget Aristotle, his blood should be bottled,
W: The best of the whole philosophical crew.
W: 
W: Homer composed a poetical potion
W: Of versification, the best in the world;
W: He juxtaposed Greeks and athletical Trojans,
W: And to the equation he added a girl.
W: He called it the Iliad, rhyming until he had
W: Filled up his brain and a ten-gallon hat;
W: When he started the Odyssey, friends said "My God is he
W: Going to remember a mouthful like that?"
W: 
W: Hippocrates, surely the first of physicians,
W: Gave medical science a shot in the arm:
W: "A doctor," he said, "must obey one condition:
W: Whatever you do, don't you do any harm."
W: His mother was pleased with his fine occupation,
W: His fortune applauded by folks far and near;
W: But he secretly grieved that his earthly duration
W: Preceded the golf club by two thousand years.
W: 
W: Three cheers for this classical civilization,
W: May songs in their honor forever be sung;
W: May each singer be granted a standing ovation
W: And glorification for each leather lung.
W: An age of pure gold, reflected in brilliance,
W: But soon, we are told, the whole place went to pot;
W: though genius infected these Greeks by the millions,
W: Not one MBA graced the whole sorry lot.

W: Yesterday a child came out to wander
W: Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
W: Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
W: And tearful at the falling of a star
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
W: Skated over ten clear frozen streams
W: Words like, "When you're older" must appease him
W: And promises of someday make his dreams
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: 16 springs and 16 summers gone now
W: Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
W: And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
W: 'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: So the years spin by and now the boy is 20
W: Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
W: There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
W: Before the last revolving year is through
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game

W: Whatever it is it does nothing for me
W: Should I drink it? Or dab it on?
W: Can I swap it for a coffee or has all the water gone
W: 
W: It is hot it is wet.
W: It is eau de toilette
W: Is it from the House of Lipton or Chanel?
W: I only want a cup of tea not this stuff you've given me
W: If you think I'm going to drink it go to
W: Help me Someone
W: 
W: Call a doctor, call a nurse!
W: Call an ambulance I'm poisoned
W: And I think it's getting worse
W: I only wanted a cup of tea
W: But I fear that my last mouthful will be the death of me
W: 
W: It is hot it is wet
W: It is eau de toilette
W: To my mind it is more toilette than eau
W: If you want to spoil your day
W: Add the oil of Earl Grey
W: I'm reliably informed it's bergamot....
W: What a mouthful
W: 
W: Is it perfume? Is it wee?
W: Whatever it's supposed to be it doesn't taste like tea
W: Should I drink it or dab it on?
W: Can I swap it for a coffee or has all the water gone?
W: 
W: It is hot it is wet
W: It is eau de toilette
W: Is it Twinings? Is it Tetley? Let me see
W: Go ahead make my day
W: But please don't make me drink Earl Grey
W: All I want is a proper cup of tea

W: I'm singing in the shower, turn the water power, up so I get a lot of steam
W: A little bit of lather, hell it doesn't matter, I didn't come here to get clean
W: Standing for a while, shout against the tiles, imagining an audience all around
W: When I'm singing in the shower, I perform for hours, listen to how good I sound!
W: 
W: Do ray me far so la tee do
W: 
W: Melancholy baby, a 10 o'clock with daisy, classical jazzical and pop
W: I can sing Ieda, while the water meter is spinning like a top
W: Mario Elanza, doesn't have a chanza, when I use my tenor baritone
W: When I'm singing in the shower, I perform for hours, listen to how good I sound!
W:

W: When my, skin begins to prune, ohh, I begin to croon
W: and a, thousand women swoon to my, light by the silvery moo-oo-ooo-oon (ahh)

W: A little bit of lather, hell it doesn't matter, I didn't come here to get clean
W: One thing sure for certain 'less I close the shower curtain, I haven't got the gumption or the gall
W: but I'd like to be singing at the albert hall, standing in my shower stall
W: 
W: (drawl)
W: I mean standing in my ooooold shower stall!

W: Starry, starry night
W: Paint your palette blue and gray
W: Look out on a summer's day
W: With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
W: Shadows on the hills
W: Sketch the trees and the daffodils
W: Catch the breeze and the winter chills
W: In colors on the snowy, linen land
W: Now, I understand what you tried to say to me
W: And how you suffered for your sanity
W: And how you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they did not know how
W: Perhaps they'll listen now
W: 
W: Starry, starry night
W: Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
W: Swirling clouds in violet haze
W: Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
W: Colors changing hue
W: Morning fields of amber grain
W: Weathered faces lined in pain
W: Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
W: Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
W: How you suffered for your sanity
W: How you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they did not know how
W: Perhaps they'll listen now
W: 
W: For they could not love you
W: But still your love was true
W: And when no hope was left inside
W: On that starry, starry night
W: You took your life as lovers often do
W: But I could have told you, Vincent
W: This world was never meant for one
W: As beautiful as you
W: 
W: Starry, starry night
W: Portraits hung in empty halls
W: Frameless heads on nameless walls
W: With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
W: Like the strangers that you've met
W: The ragged men in ragged clothes
W: The silver thorn of bloody rose
W: Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
W: Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me
W: How you suffered for your sanity
W: How you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they're not listening still
W: Perhaps they never will

W: Song and melodies change and change
W: And sway, but they still stay the same
W: The songs that we sung when the dark days come
W: Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away
W: If I ever found a pot of gold
W: I'd buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines
W: Cause I'm gonna die with a twinkle in my eye
W: Cause I sung songs, spun stories, loved, laughed, and drank wine
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: Tomorrow is another day

W: [Verse 2]
W: In summer the bushfires rage and rage
W: And rage on such beautiful days
W: And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
W: Water we're desperately trying to save
W: So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
W: And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
W: And sing on the beaches and swim through the night
W: Oh we'll cry, "Pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine"
W:

W: This is my Earth
W: And I live in it
W: It’s one third dirt
W: And two thirds water
W: And it rotates and revolves through space
W: At rather an impressive pace
W: And never even messes up my hair
W: And here’s the really weird thing
W: The force created by its spin
W: Is the force that stops the chaos flooding in
W: This is my Earth
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my country
W: And I live in it
W: It’s pretty big
W: And nice to walk on And the bloke who runs my country
W: Has built a demagoguery
W: And tought us to be fearful and boring
W: And the wierdest thing is that he is
W: Conservative of politics
W: But really rather radical of eyebrow
W: This is my country
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my house
W: And I live in it
W: It’s made of cracks
W: And photographs
W: We rent it off a guy who bought it from a guy
W: Who bought it from a guy
W: Whose grandad left it to him
W: And the weirdest thing is that this house
W: Has locks to keep the baddies out
W: But they’re mostly used to lock ourselves in
W: This is my house
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it's mine
W: 
W: This is my body
W: And I live in it
W: It’s 31
W: And 6 months old
W: It’s changed a lot since it was new
W: It’s done stuff it wasn’t built to do
W: I often try to fill it up with wine
W: And the weirdest thing about it is
W: I spend so much time hating it
W: But it never says a bad word about me
W: This is my body
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my brain
W: And I live in it
W: It’s made of love
W: And bad song lyrics
W: It’s tucked away behind my eyes
W: Where all my screwed up thoughts can hide
W: Cos God forbid I hurt somebody
W: And the weirdest thing about a mind
W: Is that every answer that you find
W: Is the basis of a brand new cliché
W: This is my brain
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: I’m not quite sure I’ve worked out how to work it
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine

W: Rows and flows of angel hair
W: And ice cream castles in the air
W: And feather canyons everywhere
W: Looked at clouds that way
W: 
W: But now they only block the sun
W: They rain and they snow on everyone
W: So many things I would have done
W: But clouds got in my way
W: 
W: I've looked at clouds from both sides now
W: From up and down and still somehow
W: It's cloud illusions I recall
W: I really don't know clouds at all
W: 
W: Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
W: The dizzy dancing way that you feel
W: As every fairy tale comes real
W: I've looked at love that way
W: 
W: But now it's just another show
W: And you leave 'em laughing when you go
W: And if you care, don't let them know
W: Don't give yourself away
W: 
W: I've looked at love from both sides now
W: From give and take and still somehow
W: It's love's illusions that I recall
W: I really don't know love
W: Really don't know love at all
W: 
W: Tears and fears and feeling proud
W: To say, "I love you" right out loud
W: Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
W: I've looked at life that way
W: 
W: Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
W: And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
W: Well something's lost, but something's gained
W: In living every day
W: 
W: I've looked at life from both sides now
W: From win and lose and still somehow
W: It's life's illusions I recall
W: I really don't know life at all
W: It's life's illusions that I recall
W: I really don't know life

W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

W: Anders spring ik in de Wolga.

W: Toen moest hij voor zijn goed fatsoen
W: Wel in de Wolga springen.
W: Hij nam een aanloop van het strand
W: En haalde net de overkant,
W: En ging daar door met zingen.
W: 
W: Ai ai Olga

W: When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
W: Me money alas I spent too fast, got drunk as drunk could be
W: And when my money was all gone 'twas then I wanted more
W: But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: I spent the night with Angeline
W: Too drunk to roll in bed
W: My watch was new and my money too
W: In the mornin' with 'em she fled
W: And as I roamed the streets about
W: The whores they all would roar
W: Here comes Jack Rack, the young sailin' lad
W: He must go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: As I was walkin' down the street
W: I met with Rapper Brown
W: I asked for him to take me in
W: And he looked at me with a frown
W: He said "Last time you was paid off
W: With me you jobbed no score
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance
W: And I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance and I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: I hired me aboard of a whaling ship
W: Bound for the Artic seas
W: Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
W: And Jamaican rum would freeze
W: And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear
W: For I'd lost all my money ashore
W: 'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
W: So I'd gone to sea no more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more.
W: 
W: Some days we're catching whales me lads
W: And some days we're catching none
W: With a twenty foot oar cocked in our hands
W: From four o'clock in the morn
W: And when the shades of night come in
W: We rest on our weary oar
W: 'Twas then I wished that I was dead
W: Or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then I wished that I was dead or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: Come all you bold seafarin' men
W: And listen to my song
W: If you come off of them long trips
W: I'd have ya's not go wrong
W: Take my advice, drink no strong drink
W: Don't go sleeping with no whores
W: Get married instead and spend all night in bed
W: So you'll go to sea no more
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
W: The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
W: Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
W: And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
W: There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
W: We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
W: And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
W: That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
W: She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
W: But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
W: Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
W: But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
W: For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
W: And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
W: Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
W: Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
W: Or I'd never have the strength to go below
W: But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
W: Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
W: Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
W: She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
W: And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
W: They won't be laughing in another day
W: And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
W: With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
W: Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
W: And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

W: O the waves crash in and the tide pulls out
W: It's an angry sea but there is no doubt
W: That the lighthouse will keep shining out
W: To warn the lonely sailor
W: And the lightning strikes and the wind cuts cold
W: Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul
W: Till there's nothing left that he can hold

W: And the sun it melts away my fear
W: I'll cry a silent weary tear
W: For those that need to ove me
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm
W: 
W: But distance it is no real friend
W: And time it takes its time
W: But you will find that in the end
W: It brings you me the lonely sailor
W: But when you take me by your side
W: You love me warm, you love me
W: And I should have realized
W: I had no reasons to be frightened
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready
W: I am ready for the storm, I'm ready for the storm

W: On the first day of March it was raining
W: It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen
W: I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there
W: I wish that all this rain would stop falling down on me
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: At the time I was working for a landlord
W: And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen
W: And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore
W: And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: I recall that we took care of him one Sunday
W: We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
W: And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
W: But all I know is I left the place without a penny or fuckall
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: But now I've the most charming of verandahs
W: I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores
W: Five green bottles sitting on the floor
W: I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ
W: That I had fifteen more
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: The boys and me are drunk and looking for you
W: We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn
W: Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam
W: And my brother earned his medals at My Lai in Vietnam
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning

W: One summer evening drunk to hell
W: I sat there nearly lifeless
W: An old man in the corner sang
W: "Where The Water Lilies Grow"
W: And on the jukebox Johnny sang
W: About a thing called love
W: And it's how are you kid and what's your name
W: And how would you bloody know?
W: 
W: In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
W: I lay down on the ground
W: And the arms and legs of other men
W: Were scattered all around
W: Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
W: Then prayed and bled some more
W: And the only thing that I could see
W: Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
W: But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
W: There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
W: [Chorus]
W: And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
W: For a pair of brown eyes
W: 
W: I looked at him he looked at me
W: All I could do was hate him
W: While Ray and Philomena sang
W: Of my elusive dreams
W: I saw the streams, the rolling hills
W: Where his brown eyes were waiting
W: And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
W: That waited once for me
W: 
W: So drunk to hell I left the place
W: Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
W: A hungry sound came across the breeze
W: So I gave the walls a talking
W: And I heard the sounds of long ago
W: From the old canal
W: And the birds were whistling in the trees
W: Where the wind was gently laughing
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: [Verse 1]
W: Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
W: He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
W: He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
W: And they all looked very happy in the morning
W: 
W: But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
W: Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
W: When he'd had too many Powers
W: So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving
W: And he took the road for God knows in the morning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: The years passed by, the times had changed, I grew to be a man
W: I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally MacLennane
W: I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
W: And ended up a barman in the morning
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
W: I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
W: I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
W: And some people left for heaven without warning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone
W: He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
W: Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked
W: Took the road for heaven in the morning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone

W:

W: There were once two Irish labouring men; to England they came over;
W: And they tramped about in search of work from Liverpool to Dover.
W: Says Mike to Pat, “I'm tired of this; we're both left in the lurch;
W: And if I don't get work, bedad, I'll go and rob a church.”
W: 
W: “What, rob a church!” says Pat to Mike; “How could you be so vile?
W: For something sure would happen while we're going down the aisle.
W: But if you do I'll go with you; and we'll get safe out, I hope;”
W: So, listen and I'll tell you now how Paddy stole the rope.
W: 
W: While off they went with theft intent to the place they wanted finding;
W: And they broke inside of a country church where nobody was minding.
W: And they scraped together all they could, they were prepared to slope,
W: When Paddy says, “Now hold on, Mike, what have we got for rope?
W: 
W: For we have no bag to hold our swag, and before we get outside,
W: With something strong and stout, my lad, this bundle must be tied.”
W: And just then he spied the church bell rope, and before you could turn about,
W: He did ride up the belfry high to climb that rope so stout.
W: 
W: And holding on by one hand and leg, he pulled his clasp knife out,
W: And right above his hand and head he cut that rope so stout.
W: Well, he quite forgot it held him up, and, by the Holy Pope,
W: Down to the bottom of the church fell Paddy and the rope.
W: 
W: “Come out of that,” says Mike to Pat, “and will you stop your moaning,
W: “If that's the way you steal a rope, it's no wonder that you're groaning.
W: I'll show you how to steal the rope, if you lend to me your knife.”
W: “O Mike, go easy,” says old Pat, “or else you'll lose your life.”
W: 
W: So Mike climbed up the other rope, just like an antelope
W: But instead of cutting it off above, he cut it off below.
W: Down fell the other piece of rope and Mike was left on high.
W: “Come down”, says Pat. “I can't,” says Mick, “for if I drop, I'll die.”
W: 
W: Well their noise it brought the beagles out, the sexton and police,
W: And though they got poor Micky down, they spared them no release.
W: And for their ingenuity they have now a wider scope
W: Than when they broke inside a church to go and steal the rope.

W: In the Year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Six
W: We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
W: We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
W: For the grand City Hall in New York
W: She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
W: And lord how the trade winds drove her
W: She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
W: And they called her the Irish Rover
W: 
W: There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
W: There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W: There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
W: And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
W: And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W: And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
W: Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W: We had two million barrels of bone
W: We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
W: We had four million barrels of stone
W: We had five million hogs and six million dogs
W: And seven million barrels of porter
W: We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
W: In the hold of the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
W: And our ship lost her way in the fog
W: And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
W: 'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
W: Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
W: We nearly tumbled over
W: Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
W: Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

W: [Verse 2]
W: They died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where
W: Save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur
W: By landslide and rockblast they got buried so deep
W: That in death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Their mark on this land is still seen and still laid
W: The way for a commerce where vast fortunes were made
W: The supply of an empire where the sun never set
W: Which is now deep in darkness, but the railway's there yet
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;
W: But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.
W: 
W: In a field by the river my love and I did stand,
W: And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.

W: In a grand ol city of London
W: Apprentice to a trade I was bound
W: And many's an hour's sweet happiness
W: Have I spent in this neat little town.
W: A sad misfortune came over me
W: Which caused me to stray from the land
W: Far away from my friends and relations
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.
W: 
W: {Chorus}
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: I took a stroll down Broadway
W: Meaning not long for to stay
W: When who should I meet but this pretty fair maid
W: Came a traipsing along the highway
W: She was both fair and handsome
W: Her neck it was just like a swans'
W: And her hair is hung over her shoulder
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid
W: And the gentleman passing us by
W: Well I knew she meant the doing of him
W: By the look in her roguish black eye
W: A gold watch she took from his pocket
W: And placed it right into my hand
W: And the very first thing I said was
W: Bad 'cess to the black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders
W: Tied up with a black velvet band.
W: 
W: Before the judge and the jury
W: Next morning I had to appear
W: And the judge he said to me 'Young man
W: Your case is proven clear'
W: We'll give you seven years penal servitude
W: To be spent far away from the land
W: Far away from your friends and companions
W: Betrayed by the black velvet band.
W: 
W: Her eyes they shone like diamonds
W: I thought her the queen of the land
W: And her hair hung over her shoulders

W: It's adieu, sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu,
W: I am going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.
W: Come change your ring with me, dear girl,
W: Come change your ring with me,
W: For it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.
W: 
W: And when I'm far upon the sea you'll know not where I am.
W: Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.
W: The secrets of your heart, dear girl,
W: Are the best of my good will,
W: So let my body be where it might, my heart will be with you still.

W: There's tinkers, tailors, shoemakers, lie snoring fast asleep,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing through the deep.
W: There's nothing to protect us, love,
W: Or keep us from the cold,
W: On the ocean wide, where we must fight like jolly seamen bold.
W: 
W: There's a heavy storm arising, see how it gathers round,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.
W: Our officers commanded us,
W: And them we must obey,
W: Expecting every moment for to get cast away.
W: 
W: But when the war is over, there'll be peace on every shore,
W: We'll return to our wives and out families, and the girls that we adore.
W: We'll drink out liquor merrily,
W: And spend out money free,
W: And when the money is all gone -- we'll boldly go to sea.

W: I was impressed like everyone,
W: When man began to fly,
W: Out of earthly regions,
W: To planets in the sky.
W: With total media coverage,
W: We watched the heros land,
W: As ceremoniously
W: They disturbed the cosmic sand.
W: 
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: Will get you from here to there.
W: Relieve you and believe me,
W: Without a worry or care.
W: If shitting is your problem,
W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to Mars.
W: 
W: In awe with admiration,
W: We listened to the talk.
W: Such pride felt they,
W: Such joy to be
W: Upon the moon to walk.
W: My romantic vision shattered,
W: When it was explained to me,
W: Spacemen wear old diapers
W: In which they shit and pee.
W: 
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: Will get you from here to there.
W: Relieve you and believe me,
W: Without a worry or care.
W: If shitting is your problem,
W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to Mars.
W: 
W: They don't partake like you and I,
W: Of beefy burger mush.
W: Their food is specially prepared
W: To dissolve into slush.
W: Absorbed by multi-fibers
W: In the super diaper suit,
W: Otherwise the slush would trickle
W: Down inside the boot.
W: 
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: Will get you from here to there.
W: Relieve you and believe me,
W: Without a worry or care.
W: If shitting is your problem
W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to Mars.
W: 
W: You may well ask now what becomes
W: Of liquid they consume.
W: A pipe is led from penis head
W: To a unit in the room.
W: The water is recirculated,
W: Filtered for re-use.
W: In case of anti-gravity -
W: Pee gets on the loose.
W: 
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: Will get you from here to there.
W: Relieve you and believe me,
W: Without a worry or care.
W: If shitting is your problem
W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to Mars.
W: 
W: Wherever man has conquered,
W: On the quest for frontiers new,
W: (Da da da da)
W: I'm glad that he's always had to do
W: The number one and two.
W: It makes it all so ordinary,
W: Just like you and me,
W: To know the greatest heroes,
W: They had to shit and pee.
W: 
W: The intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to there,
W: For cosmic constipation
W: There's none that can compare.
W: If shitting is your problem
W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: The intergalactic laxative,
W: The intergalactic laxative,

W: When I was in service in Rosemary Lane
W: I won the good favor of master and dame
W: Until a sailor came by one night for to call
W: And that was the beginning of my downfall
W: 
W: He called for a candle to light him to bed
W: And likewise a silk hankerchief to tie up his hair
W: To tie up his hair as sailors will do,
W: "And third my pretty Polly, will you come too?"
W: 
W: Now this may seem young and foolish, she thought it no harm
W: To lie on the bed to keep herself warm
W: And what was done there, I shall never disclose
W: But I wish that short night had been seven long years
W: 
W: So early next morning this sailor arose
W: And into my pockets 3 guineas did throw
W: Saying"This I will give and more I will do
W: If you'll be my Polly wherever I go"
W: 
W: Now if it's a boy, he'll fight for the King
W: And if it's a girl she'll wear a gold ring
W: She'll wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame

W: The island lies like a leaf upon the sea.
W: Green island like a leaf new-fallen from the tree.
W: Green turns to gold,
W: as morning breeze gently shakes the barley,
W: bending the yellow corn.
W: Green turns to gold,
W: there’s purple shadows on the distant mountains.
W: Sun in the yellow corn.
W: 
W: They came in their long ships from lands across the sea.
W: They came in their long ships – they saw the land was green.
W: Wind in the barley,
W: trout and salmon leaping in the rivers.
W: Sun in the yellow corn.
W: Leaping ashore
W: they slaughtered those laboured in the barley,
W: scything them down like corn.
W: 
W: The long ships sailed away and new invaders came.
W: With long bow and lance bringing death in England’s name.
W: With sword and with mace,
W: they went reaping though the fields of barley,
W: They plundered the yellow corn.
W: Crop followed crop,
W: they prospered in their killing fields of barley,
W: The harvest of new young corn.
W: 
W: Marching down the years the men of war they came,
W: with bombs, assassins, bullets, CS gas and guns.
W: Ghosts from the past
W: are chasing shadows through the fields of barley
W: hiding in the new young corn.
W: Nine hundred years
W: they tried to trap the wind that shakes the barley.
W: Sun in the yellow corn.

W: She did ev'ryone of them in.

W: One morning in a fit of pique,

W: One morning in a fit of pique,
W: She drowned her father in the creek.
W: The water tasted bad for a week,

W: Her mother she could never stand,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,

W: 
W: She set her sister's hair on fire,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
W: She set her sister's hair on fire,
W: And as the smoke and flame rose high'are,
W: Danced around the funeral pyre,
W: Playin' a violin, -olin,
W: Playin' a violin.
W: 
W: She weighted her brother down with stones,
W: Rickety-tickety-tin,
W: She weighted her brother down with stones,
W: And sent him off to davy jones.
W: All they ever found were some bones,
W: And occasional pieces of skin, of skin,
W: Occasional pieces of skin.
W: 
W: One day when she had nothing to do,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
W: One day when she had nothing to do,
W: She cut her baby brother in two,
W: And served him up as an irish stew,
W: And invited the neighbors in, -bors in,
W: Invited the neighbors in.
W: 
W: And when at last the police came by,
W: Sing rickety-tickety-tin,
W: And when at last the police came by,
W: Her little pranks she did not deny,
W: To do so she would have had to lie,
W: And lying, she knew, was a sin, a sin,
W: Lying, she knew, was a sin.
W: 
W: My tragic tale, I won't prolong,
W: Rickety-tickety-tin,
W: My tragic tale I won't prolong,
W: And if you do not enjoy the song,
W: You've yourselves to blame if it's too long,
W: You should never have let me begin, begin,
W: You should never have let me begin.

W: Have you seen him on the corner
W: His lips would reach the pavement
W: He's been hiding from the razor
W: Is he not an awful sight
W: In love he was the purest
W: Now he's frightening the tourists
W: If he'd gone and asked his father
W: Oh i'm sure he'd set him right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"
W: And tell her that you love her
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: Hold that woman tight
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: And tell her that you love her
W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Now he met her at a disco
W: In a dive in San Francisco
W: And it all might have been different
W: Had he seen her in daylight
W: She was painted she was scented
W: But she drove your man demented
W: If he'd gone and asked his father
W: Oh i'm sure he'd set him right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"
W: And tell her that you love her
W: Won't you take her in your arms

W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Here's a pub with fun and laughter
W: The landlord's buying bevvy
W: There's a session in the corner
W: And the craic is grand tonight
W: But your man has lost his woman
W: He's still at home lamenting
W: If he'd gone and asked his father
W: Oh I'm sure he'd set him right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"

W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: Hold that woman tight
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: And tell her that you love her
W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Now depression's not a million laughs
W: But suicide's so dangerous
W: Don't go leapin' out of buildings
W: In the middle of the night
W: It's not the fall but landing
W: That will alter social standing
W: So go first and ask your father
W: And I'm sure he'll set you right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"
W: And tell her that you love her
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: Hold that woman tight
W: Won't you take her in your arms
W: And tell her that you love her
W: If you're going to love a woman then be sure to do it right
W: 
W: Here's a health to all true lovers
W: Their sisters and their brothers
W: And their uncles and their grannies
W: For this thing is black and white
W: If you're keen to start romancing
W: With its leapin' and its dancin'
W: Then go first and ask your father
W: And I'm sure he'll set you right
W: 
W: Saying "take her in your arms"

W: In Dublin town he built a church
W: And on it, put the steeple
W: 
W: His father was a Callaghan
W: His mother was a Brady
W: His auntie an O'Shaughnessy
W: Hus uncle an O'Grady
W:

W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!
W: There's not a mile in Erin's isle
W: Where the dirty vermin musters
W: Where there he put his dear forefoot
W: He murdered them in clusters
W: 
W: The toads went hop! The frogs went pop!
W: Slap-dash into the water
W: And beasts committed suicide
W: To save themselves from slaughter
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists

W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist
W: And banish them forever!
W: 
W: The Wicklow hills are very high
W: And so is the hill of Howth, sir
W: And there's a hill much bigger still
W: Much higher than them both, sir
W: 
W: 'Twas on the top of this high hill
W: Saint Patrick preached his sermons
W: He drove the frogs into the bogs
W: And banished all the vermins
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists
W: He was a Saint so clever
W: He'd give the snakes and toads a twist

W: Should be so gay and frisky
W: Well, sure, Saint Pat, he taught them that
W: As well as makin' whiskey
W: 
W: No wonder that the saint himself
W: Should understand distillin'
W: His mother kept a shebeen shop
W: In the town of Enniskillen
W: 
W: Then here's to bold Saint Paddy's fists

W: Let us sing aloud with gladness, dance with joy and exaltation
W: Make an end to woe and sadness in ecstatic jubilation.
W: I shall now relate the story, listen hard to my narration,
W: It's a tale that ends in glory though it starts with tribulation.
W: This old man decayed and hoary, without movement or sensation,
W: In his limbs diseased and gory has been cured through knowledge and passion.
W: 
W: Never more the ruthless rigour, of that cruel mutilation,
W: Shall embitter or disfigure, both his life and his vocation.
W: Now his strength's returned with vigour, through his blessed rejuvenation,
W: And his faith has grown much bigger, since his thrilling restoration.
W: This old man decayed and hoary, without movement or sensation,
W: In his limbs diseased and gory has been cured through knowledge and passion.

W: Como poden per sas culpas, os o-mes-se-er con trei-tos
W: As si poden pel a virgen, de pois seer saos feitos.
W: Ond' a ye-o a un o-me, porpe-ca-dis que fe-le-tion
W: Que foi to-llei-to dos nembros, d'u-a do-or que ou-ve-ra.
W: Et du rou as si cinc a nos que mo-ve-se no po-de-ra
W: As-si a-vi-a os nembros , todos do corpo mal treitos

W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
W: When you're perfect in every way
W: I can't wait to look in the mirror
W: Cause I get better looking each day
W: To know me is to love me
W: I must be a hell of a man
W: Oh Lord It's hard to be humble,
W: But I'm doing the best that I can
W: I used to have a girlfriend,
W: But I guess she just couldn't compete,
W: With all of these love-starved women,
W: Who keep cowering at my feet
W: Oh I probably could find me another,
W: But I guess they're all in awe of me
W: Who cares?

W: Cause I treasure my own company
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble

W: (Oh Lord It's hard)
W: Oh Lord It's hard to be humble,
W: (When you're doing what?)
W: We're doing the best that we can
W: I guess you could say I'm a loner
W: A cowboy out lone, tough, and proud
W: I could have lots of friends if I wanted
W: But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
W: Some folks say that I'm egotistical
W: Hell I don't even know what that means
W: I guess it has something to do
W: With the way that I fill out my skin tight with jeans
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble
W: (When you're perfect in every way)
W: When you're perfect in every way
W: (Can't wait to look in the mirror)
W: I can't wait to look in the mirror

W: (To know me is to what?)
W: To know me is to love me
W: (Must be a hell of man)

W: Some say love, it is a river
W: That drowns the tender reed
W: Some say love, it is a razor
W: That leaves your soul to bleed
W: Some say love, it is a hunger
W: An endless aching need
W: I say love, it is a flower
W: And you, its only seed
W: 
W: It's the heart, afraid of breaking
W: That never learns to dance
W: It's the dream, afraid of waking
W: That never takes the chance
W: It's the one who won't be taken
W: Who cannot seem to give
W: And the soul, afraid of dying
W: That never learns to live
W: 
W: When the night has been too lonely
W: And the road has been too long
W: And you think that love is only
W: For the lucky and the strong
W: Just remember in the winter
W: Far beneath the bitter snows
W: Lies the seed that with the sun's love
W: In the spring becomes the rose

W: Along the folks I know,
W: Ranging o'er the countryside

W: In the place where I was born,
W: Far away in Lancashire, on a good fine hunting morn.
W: 
W: VERSE 3
W: There's greatly hounds in Lancashire
W: As such there always were,
W: There's greatly hills in Lancashire
W: Although they're bleak and bare,
W: There's greatly lads i' Lancashire
W: And that I'll tell you true,
W: And I wish I was in Lancashire, a huntin' o'er the dew.

W: Far away in Lancashire, on a windy morn.
W: 
W: VERSE DEREK
W: Now rainfall in Cobargo, would spoil a bloody good drought.
W: And deregulated dairying, leaves me with no doubt.
W: Feeding stock every day, shooting kangaroos.
W: No wonder we sing of Lancashire to beat the rural blues.

W: Rosie's out in the forest today, she's taking down a tree.
W: And with each blow of the  axe she feels the tree giving up it's life.
W: But she promises that the shelter she'll build will last at least as long.
W: Till the seedlings grown from this very tree, have grown up tall and strong.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Rosie's house, Rosie's house, growing in the forest
W: Built of the earth on which it stands.
W: Built by her slender hands.
W: 
W: Rosie's fixing the roof on today, she's hammering down the tin.
W: And with each ring of the hammer she sees her shelter taking form.
W: And she uses tin that's been used before for it's still sound and strong.
W: She'll recycle things that come her way and make them work again.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Rosie's building a fire place today, she works with brick and stone.
W: And with each cut of the chisel she shows the heart of a living home.
W: For everywhere you can see the fruit of her patient years of toil.
W: Walk the rooms in this magic place where her crazy dreams made real.
W:

W: (she said you know) I used to sell tickets at the railway station, but then one day I had a revelation.
W: 
W: I feel the same only different, something's changed, something's shifted big time.
W: My mind don't feel so restricted, I see a new shine on my horizon.

W: When I was young my teachers told me, this is the truth the way it should be
W: but what I learned as I got older,
W: the good things you keep, the rest you throw away over your shoulder
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: I met a man he stood apart from others, he said the truth is in your heart my brothers.
W: Selfishness should always be rejected, just keep smiling and you'll stay connected.

W: I see the girls walk by, dressed in their summer clothes
W: I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

W: I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
W: Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
W: 
W: I look inside myself and see my heart is black
W: I see my red door, I must have it painted black

W: I could not foresee this thing happening to you
W: If I look hard enough into the setting sun
W: My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

W: There were three auld gypsies came to our hall door.
W: They came brave and boldly-o.
W: And one sang high and the other sang low
W: And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o.
W: 
W: It was upstairs, downstairs the lady went,
W: Put on her suit of leather-o,
W: And it was the cry all around her door;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: It was late that night when the lord came in,
W: Enquiring for his lady-o,
W: And the servant girl’s reply to him was;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Then saddle for me my milk-white steed
W: Me big horse is not speedy-o
W: And I will ride and I’ll seek me bride,
W: She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: He rode east and he rode west
W: He rode north and south also,
W: And when he rode to the wide open field
W: It was there that he spied his lady-o.
W: 
W: “Arra, why did you leave your house and your land,
W: Why did you leave your money-o?
W: Why did you leave your only wedded lord
W: All for the raggle taggle gypsy-o?”
W: 
W: “Yerra what do I care for me house and me land?
W: What do I care for money-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “It was there last night you’d a goose feather bed,
W: Blankets drawn so comely-o.
W: But tonight you lie in a wide open field
W: In the arms of the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Yerra, what do I care for me goose feather bed?
W: Yerra, what do I care for blankets-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Oh, for you rode east when I rode west,
W: You rode high and I rode low.
W: I’d rather have a kiss of the yellow gypsy’s lips
W: Than all the cash and money-o”

W: [Verse 1]
W: I think I'm sophisticated
W: 'Cause I'm living my life like a good homosapien
W: But all around me everybody's multiplying
W: 'Til they're walking round like flies man
W: So I'm no better than the animals sitting in their cages
W: In the zoo man
W: 'Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees
W: I am an ape man
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized
W: 'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
W: But with the over-population and inflation and starvation
W: And the crazy politicians

W: The motor traffic rumble, but give me half a chance
W: And I'd be taking off my clothes and living in the jungle"

W: [Chorus]
W: 'Cause the only time that I feel at ease

W: I'm an ape man

W: I'm a voodoo man
W: I'm an ape man

W: I want to get out of this city alive
W: And make like an ape man
W: [Bridge]
W: Come on and love me
W: Be my ape man girl
W: And we'll be so happy

W: I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane
W: I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
W: And we'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day

W: Awaiting a word
W: Gasping at glimpses
W: Of gentle true spirit
W: He runs, wishing he could fly
W: Only to trip at the sound of good-bye
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Wordlessly watching
W: He waits by the window
W: And wonders
W: At the empty place inside
W: Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
W: He worries
W: Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?

W: You'll see something
W: Certain to tell you confusion has its cost

W: And choking on hello
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: In another younger day I could dream the time away
W: In the universe inside my room
W: And the world was really mine from june til september
W: And if it wasn't really so I was lucky not to know
W: And I was lucky not to wonder why
W: Because the summer time is all that I remember
W: 
W: A summer fly was buzzin' every night when I was young
W: In the gentle world my childlike senses knew
W: And the world was just my cousin
W: And the wind was just the tongue
W: In the voice my lonely moments listened to
W: 
W: And I look at me today all the dreams have gone away
W: And I'm where I never thought I would be
W: Seein' things I never thought I would see happen'en to me
W: And I lay awake at night til the darkness turns to light
W: Hearin' voices callin' out my name
W: Dronin' over and again the same message to me
W: 
W: Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's
W: Your baby now?
W: Who wakes up at night to pull you in
W: But it don't matter, you'll just make her lonely anyhow

W: One Sunday morning as I went walking, by the Brisbane's waters I chanced to stray,
W: I heard a convict his fate bewailing, as on the sunny river bank he lay;
W: "I am a native of Erin's island but banished now to the fatal shore,
W: They tore me from my aged parents and from the maiden I do adore.
W: 
W: "I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie, Norfolk Island and Emu Plains,
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie, at all those settlements I've worked in chains;
W: But of all those places of condemnation, in each penal station of New South Wales,
W: To Moreton Bay I've found no equal: excessive tyranny there each day prevails.
W: 
W: "For three long years I was beastly treated, heavy irons on my legs I wore,
W: My back from flogging it was lacerated, and often painted with crimson gore,
W: And many a lad from downright starvation lies mouldering humbly beneath the clay,
W: Where Captain Logan he had us mangled on his triangles at Moreton Bay.
W: 
W: "Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews, we were oppressed under Logan's yoke,
W: Till a native black who lay in ambush did give our tyrant his mortal stroke.
W: Fellow prisoners, be exhilarated, that all such monsters such a death may find!
W: And when from bondage we are liberated, our former sufferings shall fade from mind."

W: a bit of you ma
W: 
W: V1
W: Always there with kindness in your eyes. An ear and a smile and some safety for a while.
W: Always there with simple honest truth. From the heart to the mouth. Sometimes too soon.
W: Always with the energy to play. To take the time to share our ways.
W: Now that you are gone I hope to keep. A bit of you, inside of me.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Inside me, inside us a bit of you.
W: Your honesty and kindness and warmth in your eyes
W: Inside us, inside me a bit of you
W: Walking with us always by our side
W: 
W: V2
W: Will we hold together as we've done. Without your warmth and endless talk.
W: What will we do together what will we eat. Who'll make our favorite Xmas treats.
W: Who will have the news of distant friends and family making ends.
W: Changes they will come to suit our needs but that bit inside will keep us tied.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: V3
W: Who will tell me everythings alright. Say I've done well. Enjoy my play.
W: Who will counsel kindness over all. To feel for others frailties.
W: Who will make feel that I'm OK. Who will love me no matter what I say.
W: Only I can hold that bit for me. And know that I am loved from your long sleep.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: V4
W: Some might promise we will meet again. In one true place, no hurt or pain.
W: I draw more to know that you're inside. A part of sense, how I decide.
W: My music and my twitches and my friends. Expressing you through me.
W: You will always be inside of me. A bit of you, inside of me.

W: But stronger, Trying to be stronger with each other

W: A gypsy came to the castle gate,
W: He sang so sweet and wild.
W: And with his song he stole away,
W: The master’s only child.
W: 
W: Oh she cast away her silken gown,
W: She cast away her pride;
W: And ran with him into the night,
W: Down to the sea so wild.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: Sit once more by a round fireside,
W: With your head upon my knee!
W: 
W: Oh I’d rather live an hour here,
W: Than seven long years with thee.
W: And feel the salt spray on my cheek,
W: And know that I am free.
W: 
W: Oh she danced in the wind and she danced in the rain,
W: on the edge of the cliffs and the shore!
W: And she tasted the salt upon her cheek,
W: And never came home no more!
W: 
W: Till ... a babe was born on a summers morn,
W: He was his parents joy.
W: His mother held him to her heart,
W: Her precious gypsy boy.
W: 
W: She took him to her fathers house,
W: She beat upon the gate.
W: Crying, ‘come and see my darling babe,
W: We named him for your sake’.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: And the father of that darlin' babe
W: Shall be a son to me.
W: 
W: They danced all the day and they danced all the night.
W: And they danced on the cliffs and the shore.
W: And the master held his grandchild tight,
W: And ne’er was alone no more.

W: Won't you be my girl
W: Won't you be my girl
W: Won't you be my, be my
W: Be my girl
W: 
W: I was blue and lonely
W: I couldn't sleep a wink
W: And I could only get unconscious
W: If I'd had to much to drink
W: There was somehow, something wrong somewhere
W: And each day seemed grey and dead
W: The seeds of desperation
W: Were growing in my head
W: 
W: I needed inspiration
W: A brand new start in life
W: Somewhere to place affection
W: But I didn't want a wife
W: 
W: And then by lucky chance I saw
W: In a special magazine
W: An ad that was unusual
W: The like I'd never seen
W: 
W: "Experience something different
W: With our new imported toy
W: She's loving, warm, inflatable
W: And a guarantee of joy"
W: 
W: She came all wrapped in cardboard
W: All pink and shrivelled down
W: A breath of air was all she needed
W: To make her lose that frown
W: 
W: I took her to the bedroom
W: And pumped her with some life
W: And later in a moment
W: That girl became my wife
W: 
W: And so I sit her in the corner
W: And sometimes stroke her hair
W: And when I'm feeling naughty
W: I blow her up with air
W: 
W: She's cuddly and she's bouncy
W: She's like a rubber ball
W: I bounce her in the kitchen
W: And I bounce her in the hall
W: 
W: And now my life is different
W: Since Sally came my way
W: I wake up in the morning
W: And have her on a tray
W: 
W: She's everything they say she was
W: And I wear a permanent grin
W: And I only have to worry
W: In case my girl wears thin
W: 
W: Won't you be my girl
W: Won't you be my girl
W: Won't you be my, be my
W: Be my girl

W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young girl calling
W: Michael they are taking you away
W: For you stole Trevelyans corn
W: So the young might see the morn
W: Now a prison ship lay waiting in the bay
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young man calling
W: Nothing matters Mary when you're free
W: Against the famine and the crown
W: I rebelled they cut me down
W: Now you must raise our child with dignity
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: By a lonely harbour wall
W: She watched the last star falling
W: As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
W: For she lives to hope and pray
W: For her love in Botany bay
W: It's so lonely around the fields of Athenry

W: Sonny lives on a farm, in a wide open space
W: Take off your shoes, stay out of the race
W: Lay down your head, on a soft river bed
W: Sonny always remembers the words Mamma says.
W: 
W: Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone
W: Your Daddy's a sailor, never comes home,
W: Nights are so long, silence goes on,
W: I'm feeling so tired and not all that strong.
W: 
W: Sonny works on the land, though he's barely a man
W: There's not much to do but he does what he can
W: Sits by his window in his room by the stairs
W: Watching the waves drifting soft on the pier.
W: 
W: Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone
W: Your Daddy's a sailor, never comes home,
W: Nights are so long, silence goes on,

W: 
W: Many years have rolled on, Sonny's old and alone
W: His Daddy the sailor, never came home
W: Sometimes he wonders what his life might have been
W: But from the grave Mamma still haunts his dreams.
W: 
W: Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone
W: Your Daddy's a sailor, never comes home,
W: Nights are so long, silence goes on,
W: I'm feeling so tired and not all that strong.

W: By chance it was I met my love
W: It did me much surprise
W: Down by a shady myrtle grove
W: Just as the sun did rise
W: The birds they sang right gloriously
W: And pleasant was the air
W: And there was none save she and I
W: Among the flowers fair
W: 
W: In dewy grass and green we walked
W: She timid was and coy
W: How can'st thou choose but pity me
W: My pretty pearl, my joy
W: How comes it that thou stroll this way?
W: Sweet maiden tell me true
W: Before bright Phoebus' glittering ray
W: Has supped the morning dew?
W: 
W: I go to tend the flocks I love
W: The ewes and tender lambs
W: That pasture by the myrtle grove
W: That gambol by their dams
W: There I enjoy a pure content
W: At dawning of the day
W: Then, hand in hand, we lovers went
W: To see the flock at play
W: 
W: And as we wended down the road
W: I said to her, "Sweet maid
W: Three years I in my place abode
W: And three more must be stayed
W: The three that I am bound so fast
W: O fairest wait for me
W: And when the weary years are past
W: Then wedded we will be."
W: 
W: "Three years are long, three times too long
W: Too lengthy the delay"
W: And then I answered in my song
W: "Hope wastes them quick away
W: Where love is fervent, fain and fast
W: And knoweth not decay
W: There nimbly fleet the seasons past
W: Accounted as one day."

W: Harking is bonnie and there lives my love
W: My heart lies on him and will not remove
W: It will not remove oh for all that I have done
W: Oh I never will forget my love Anachie
W: For Anachie Gordon, he's bonnie and he's rough
W: He'd entice any woman that ever he saw
W: He'd entice any woman and so he has done me
W: Oh I never will forget my love Anachie
W: 
W: Down came her father and he's standing by the door
W: Saying Jeannie you're trying the tricks of a whore
W: You care nothing for a man who cares so very much for thee
W: You must marry Lord Salton and leave Anachie
W: For Anachie Gordon, he's barely but a man
W: Although he may be pretty but where are his lands?
W: Oh the Sulton's lands are broad and his towers they run high
W: You must marry Lord Sulton and leave Anachie
W: 
W: With Anachie Gordon I'd beg for my bread
W: And before I'll marry Sulton it's gold to my head
W: With gold to my head and gowns fringed to the knee
W: And I'll die if I don't get me love Anachie
W: And you that are my parents to church you may me bring
W: But unto Lord Sulton I'll never bear a son
W: To a son or a daughter, I'll never bow my knee
W: And I'll die if I don't get me love  Anachie
W: 
W: Jeannie was married and from church she was brought home
W: And when she and her maidens so merry should have been
W: When she and her maidens so merry should have been
W: She went into her chambers she cried all alone
W: Come to bed now Jeannie me honey and my sweet
W: For to style you my mistress it would be so sweet
W: Be it mistress or Jeannie it's all the same to me
W: But in your bed Lord Sulton I never will lie
W: 
W: And down came her father and he's spoken with reknown
W: Saying you that are her maidens go loosen off her gowns
W: But she fell down to the floor so close down by his knee
W: Saying father look I'm dying for me love Anachie
W: 
W: The day that Jeannie married was the day that Jeannie died
W: And the day that young Anachie came home on the tide
W: And down came her maidens all wringing of their hands
W: Saying oh it's been so long you've spent so long on the sands
W: Oh so long on the sands, so long on the flood
W: They have married your Jeannie and now she lies dead
W: 
W: You that are her maidens go take me by the hand
W: And take me to the chamber that me love she lies in
W: And he's kissed her cold lips till his heart has turned to stone
W: And he's died in the chamber that his love she lies in

W: Verses:
W: Come me own one, come me fair one, come now unto me
W: Could you fancy a poor sailor lad, Who has just come from sea?
W: 
W: You are ragged love, you are dirty love, and your clothes smell much of tar
W: So begone you saucy sailor lad, so begone you Jack Tar
W: 
W: If I am ragged love, and I'm dirty love, and me clothes smell much of tar
W: I have silver in me pocket love, and gold in great store
W: 
W: And then when she heard him say so on her bended knee she fell
W: I will marry my dear Henry for I love a sailor lad so well
W: 
W: you think that I am foolish love, you think that I am mad?
W: For to wed with a poor country girl, Where no fortune's to be had
W: 
W: I will cross the briny ocean, I will whistle and sing
W: And since you have refused me offer love, some other girl shall wear the ring
W: 
W: I am frolicsome, and I am easy, good tempered and free
W: And I don't give a single pin me boys, What the world thinks of me
W: 
W: 
W: Solo: repeat and fade

W: [Verse 1]
W: Near Banbridge Town in the County Down
W: One morning last July
W: Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín
W: And she smiled as she passed me by
W: She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
W: To the sheen of her nut-brown hair
W: Such a winsome elf, I'm ashamed of myself
W: For to see I was staring there
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: [Verse 2]
W: As she onward sped, sure I scratched me head
W: And I looked with a feelin' rare
W: And I says, says I, to a passer-by
W: "Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair"?
W: Well, he looked at me and he said to me:
W: "That's the gem of Ireland's crown
W: Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann
W: She's the star of the County Down"
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: She'd soft brown eyes with a look so shy
W: And a smile like the rose in June
W: And she sang so sweet what a lovely treat
W: As she lilted an Irish tune
W: At the Lammas dance I was in the trance
W: As she whirled with the lads of the town
W: And it broke me heart just to be apart
W: From the star of the County Down
W: [Chorus]
W: From Bantry Bay up to Derry's Quay
W: From Galway to Dublin Town
W: No maid I've seen like the fair cailín
W: That I met in the County Down
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
W: So I'll dress in me Sunday clothes
W: With me shoes shone bright and me hat cocked right
W: For a smile from the nut brown rose
W: No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
W: Till my plough is a rust colored brown
W: And a smiling bride by me own fireside
W: Sits the star of the County Down

W: [Verse 1]
W: It was a slow day and the sun was beating
W: On the soldiers by the side of the road
W: There was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows
W: The bomb in the baby carriage was wired to the radio
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: This is the long distance call
W: The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
W: The way we look to us all
W: The way we look to a distant constellation
W: That's dying in a corner of the sky
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: It was a dry wind and it swept across the desert
W: And it curled into the circle of birth
W: And the dead sand falling on the children
W: The mothers and the fathers and the automatic earth
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: This is the long distance call
W: The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
W: The way we look to us all
W: The way we look to a distant constellation
W: That's dying in a corner of the sky
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry
W: 
W: [Bridge]
W: It's a turn-around jump shot
W: It's everybody jump start
W: It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts
W: Medicine is magical and magical is art
W: Think of the boy in the bubble
W: And the baby with the baboon heart
W: 
W: [Chorus 2]
W: And I believe these are the days of lasers in the jungle
W: Lasers in the jungle somewhere
W: Staccato signals of constant information
W: A loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires and baby
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: This is the long distance call
W: The way the camera follows us in slo-mo
W: The way we look to us all
W: The way we look to a distant constellation
W: That's dying in a corner of the sky
W: These are the days of miracle and wonder
W: And don't cry baby, don't cry, don't cry

W: So, so you think you can tell
W: Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
W: Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
W: A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
W: Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
W: Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
W: Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
W: A walk-on part in the war
W: For a lead role in a cage?

W: [Acoustic Guitar Solo]
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: How I wish, how I wish you were here
W: We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
W: Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
W: The same old fears, wish you were here

W: Lighthouse tall and grand
W: Standing on that cold headland
W: Shine your light across the sea
W: For a wayward sailor girl like me
W: 
W: Lighthouse man
W: Guide this sailor back to land
W: Steer my ship on through the storm
W: Back to water safe and calm
W: 
W: Sometimes I need a lighthouse for my own
W: It gets so dark I can't see which way I'm going
W: Oh lighthouse man I'm all at sea
W: Shine a little lighthouse light on me
W: Lighthouse man I'm all at sea
W: Shine a little lighthouse light on me
W: Lighthouse man can't help us all
W: Some he'll save and some will fall
W: He'll show you where the danger lies
W: But he can't help it if you capsize
W: He'll light your way but that is all
W: Steer your own ship back to shore
W: 
W: Won't you light my lonely way back home
W: This sea is full of misery and woe
W: Oh woe betide those that say
W: They don't need no light to light their way
W: They think they're safe enough on their own
W: Drown in murky depths below
W: 
W: We all need a lighthouse for our own
W: It gets so dark I can't see which way I'm going

W: With her opal robes serene
W: In the lamplight shimmering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: When your feet don’t touch the earth

W: And we all shall pay in full
W: For a love of melody

W: Well there must be better ways
W: For to keep their debts at bay
W: And the whisky trickling
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: So we’ll bid our ship adieu
W: There’s a mooring in the blue
W: Where the gulls are gathering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: And her like shall ne’er be seen
W: Only in our reverie

W: The faces in the photograph are faded
W: And I can't believe he looks so much like me
W: For it's been ten long years today
W: Since I left for Old Cork Station
W: Saying "I won't be back 'til the droving's done"
W: 
W: For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
W: The drover finds it hard to change his mind
W: For the years have surely gone
W: Like the drays from Old Cork Station
W: And I won't be back 'til the droving's done
W: 
W: It seems like the sun comes up each morning
W: Sets me up and then takes it all away
W: For the dreaming by the light
W: Of the camp fire at night
W: Ends with the burning like a day
W: 
W: For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
W: The drover finds it hard to change his mind
W: For the years have surely gone
W: Like the drays from Old Cork Station
W: And I won't be back 'til the droving's done
W: 
W: I sometimes I think I'll settle back in Sydney
W: But it's been so long and it's hard to change your mind
W: For the cattle trail goes on and on
W: And fences roll forever
W: And I won't be back when the droving's done
W: 
W: For the rain never falls on the dusty Diamantina
W: The drover finds it hard to change his mind
W: For the years have surely gone
W: Like the drays from Old Cork Station

W: My song for you this evening, it's not to make you sad
W: Nor for adding to the sorrows of our troubled northern land
W: But lately I've been thinking and it just won't leave my mind
W: I'll tell you of two friends one time who were both good friends of mine
W: 
W: Isaac he was Protestant and Sean was Catholic born
W: But it never made a difference, for the friendship it was strong
W: And sometimes in the evening when we heard the sound of drums
W: We said it won't divide us, we will always be as one
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: It was on a Sunday morning when the awful news came round
W: 
W: Another killing had been done just outside Newry Town
W: We knew that Isaac danced up there, we knew he liked the band
W: But when we heard that he was dead we just could not understand
W: Now fear it filled the countryside there was fear in every home
W: When late at night a car came prowling round the Ryan Road
W: A Catholic would be killed tonight to even up the score
W: Oh Christ it's young McDonald they have taken from the door
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: I don't know where the moral is or where this song should end
W: But I wonder just how many wars are fought between good friends
W: And those who give the orders are not the ones to die
W: It's Scott and young McDonald and the likes of you and I
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together

W: Verse 1
W: 
W: Well how do you do, young Willie McBride?
W: you mind if I sit here down by your graveside?
W: And rest for a while 'neath the warm summer sun,
W: I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
W: I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen,
W: When you joined the great fallen in 1916,
W: I hope you died well and I hope you died clean,
W: Or young Willie McBride, was it slow and obscene?
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Did they beat the drum slowly? Did they play the fife lowly?
W: Did they sound the death march, as they lowered you down?
W: Did the band play the Last Post and chorus?
W: Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: 
W: Did you leave ere a wife or a sweetheart behind?
W: In some faithful heart is your memory enshrined?
W: Although you died back in 1916,
W: In that faithful heart are you forever nineteen?
W: Or are you a stranger without even a name?
W: Enclosed in forever behind a glass frame,
W: In an old photograph all torn battered and stained,
W: And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame.
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: 
W: The sun now it shines on the green fields of France,
W: There's a warm summer breeze that makes the red poppies dance,
W: And look how the sun shines from under a cloud,
W: There's no gas, no barbed wire, there's no gun firing now.
W: But here in this graveyard it's still "No Man's Land",
W: The countless white crosses stand mute in the sand,
W: To man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
W: To a whole generation that were butchered and damned.
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 4
W: 
W: Ah, young Willie McBride I can't help wonder why,
W: those that lie here know why did they die?
W: And did they believe when they answered the call?
W: Did they really believe that this war would end wars?
W: Well, the sorrow, the suffering, the glory, the pain,
W: The killing and dying were all done in vain,
W: For young Willie McBride it all happened again,
W: And again, and again, and again, and again.
W: 
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Did they beat the drum slowly? Did they play the fife lowly?
W: Did they sound the death march, as they lowered you down?
W: Did the band play the Last Post and chorus?
W: And did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest?

C:Bob Dylan
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: They sat together in the park
W: 
W: As the evening sky grew dark
W: 
W: She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
W: 
W: It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
W: 
W: And watched out for a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: They walked alone by the old canal
W: 
W: A little confused I remember well
W: 
W: And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
W: 
W: He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
W: 
W: Moving with a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: A saxophone someplace far off played
W: 
W: As she was walking on by the arcade
W: 
W: As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up
W: 
W: She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
W: 
W: And forgot about a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: He woke up the room was bare
W: 
W: He didn't see her anywhere
W: 
W: He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
W: 
W: Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
W: 
W: Brought on by a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: He hears the ticking of the clocks
W: 
W: And walks along with a parrot that talks
W: 
W: Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in
W: 
W: Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
W: 
W: One more time for a simple twist of fate.
W: 
W: People tell me it's a sin
W: 
W: To know and feel too much within
W: 
W: I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
W: 
W: She was born in spring but I was born too late
W: 
W: Blame it on a simple twist of fate.

W: 
W: Ice will melt, water will boil
W: You and I can shake off this mortal coil
W: It's bigger than us
W: You don't have to worry about it
W: 
W: Ready or not here comes the drop
W: You feel lucky when you know where you are
W: You know it's gonna come true
W: Here in your arms I remember
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: 
W: It's easy when you don't try
W: Going on first impressions
W: Man in a cage has made his confession
W: Now you've seen me at my worst
W: And it won't be the last time I'm down there
W: 
W: I want you to know I feel completely at ease
W: Read me like a book that's fallen down between your knees
W: Please, let me have my way with you
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: It's circumstantial, it's nothing written in the sky
W: And we don't even have to try
W: 
W: Shaking like mud, buildings of glass
W: Sink into the bay, they'll be under the rocks again
W: You don't have to say I know you're afraid
W: 
W: It's only natural that I should want to be there with you
W: It's only natural that you should feel the same way too
W: It's circumstantial, it's something I was born to
W: It's only natural, can I help it if I want to?
W: 
W: Can I help it if I want to?

W: You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: And you got paid on Friday
W: And your pockets are jinglin'
W: And you see the lights
W: You get all tinglin' cause you're cruisin' with a six
W: And you're looking for the heart of Saturday night

W: Tryin' to wipe out ev'ry trace
W: All the other days in the week you know
W: that this'll be the Saturday you're reachin' your peak
W: 
W: Stoppin' on the red
W: You're goin' on the green
W: 'Cause tonight'll be like nothin'

W: And you're barrelin' down the boulevard
W: Lookin' for the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Tell me is the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzin'?
W: Telephone's ringin', it's your second cousin
W: Is it the barmaid that's smilin' from the corner of her eye?
W: Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
W: 
W: Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
W: 'Cause you're dreamin' of them Saturdays that came before
W: And now you're stumblin'
W: You're stumblin' onto the heart of Saturday night
W: 
W: Well you gassed her up
W: And you're behind the wheel

T: The Pheasant Plucking Song
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Me husband is a keeper, he's a very busy man,
W: 
W: I try to understand him and I help him all I can,
W: 
W: But sometimes of an evening I feel a trifle dim,
W: 
W: All alone and plucking pheasants when I'd rather pluck with him.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's mate
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: Cos the pheasant plucker's late.
W: 
W: I'm not good at plucking pheasants, pheasant plucking I get stuck,
W: 
W: Though some peasants find it pleasant I'd much rather pluck a duck,
W: 
W: Oh, but plucking geese is gorgeous, I can pluck a goose with ease
W: 
W: But plucking pheasants is sheer torture, for they haven't any grease.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: He has gone out on the tiles,
W: 
W: He only plucked one pheasant
W: 
W: And I'm sitting here with piles.
W: 
W: You have to pluck them fresh, if they're fresh it's not unpleasant,
W: 
W: I knew a man in Dunstable, could pluck a frozen pheasant.
W: 
W: They say the village constable has pheasant plucking sessions
W: 
W: With the vicar of a Sunday 'twixt the first and second lessons.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's son,
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: Till the pheasant plucker's come.
W: 
W: My good friend Godfrey's most adept, he's really got the knack,
W: 
W: He likes to have a pheasant plucked before he hits the sack.
W: 
W: I try and lend a helping hand, I gather up the feathers,
W: 
W: It's really all this pheasant plucking keeps us here together.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's friend,
W: 
W: And I'm only plucking pheasants
W: 
W: As a means unto an end.
W: 
W: Me husband's in the woods all day, a-banging with his gun,
W: 
W: If he could hear me heartfelt cries, then surely he would run,
W: 
W: For I've fluff in all me crannies and there's feathers up me nose,
W: 
W: And I'm itchin' in the kitchin' from me head down to me toes.
W: 
W: I'm not the pheasant plucker,
W: 
W: I'm the pheasant plucker's wife,
W: 
W: And when we pluck together
W: 
W: It's a pheasant plucking life!

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: There was a woman in our town and in our town did dwell,
W: She loved her old man dearly but another man twice as well.
W: Chorus (after each verse):
W: And sing fal-the-lal-lal-the-lal-li-day
W: Fal-the-lal lal-li-day
W: She went down to the doctor to see if she could find
W: Anything in the whole world to make her old man blind.
W: "Oh take him sixteen marrowbones and make him eat them all,
W: And when he's finished he'll be so blind, he won't see you at all."
W: So the doctor he wrote a letter and he sealed it with his hand,
W: And he sent it up to the old man to make him understand.
W: But the old man being a crafty bugger he knew it all before,
W: He ate 'em up and he says, "My dear, oh I can't see you at all."
W: Says he, "I'll go to the river and there myself I'll drown."
W: Says she, "I'll walk along with you to see that you don't fall down."
W: They walked along together till they come to the river's brim,
W: So gently there she's kissed him and she crept away behind.
W: She ran and she ran behind him to try to push him in,
W: But the old man heard and he jumped aside and she went tumbling in.
W: So loudly she did holler and loud for mercy call,
W: But the old man says, "I am so blind, I can't see you at all."
W: She swam and she swam and she swam around till she came to the further brim,
W: But the old man got the barge pole and he pushed her further in.
W: "Oh it may take sixteen marrowbones to make your old man blind,
W: But if you want to murder him you must creep up close behind."

W: 
W: This is your new thing now
W: 
W: Cards out on the table, a genouus with no label

W: Sometimes I see the half and not the whole

W: 
W: For anyone who ever had a heart
W: 
W: This is your new thing now

W: 
W: Just a broad and her pimps, but not quite

W: This is your new thing now

W: Equal parts butthead and Peter Pan
W: 
W: All the other kids are sad again
W: 
W: A legend’s not a legend till it ends
W: 
W: This is your new thing now
W: 
W: And now you’re turning grinning
W: 
W: But no one is listening
W: 
W: And you might loose it all my darling, yes you might, you might
W: 
W: This is your new thing now
W: 
W: And it feels so good to doubt you
W: 
W: I could almost live without you, but not quite
W: 
W: not quite

W: You're all that was there
W: Stood by on believing
W: Stood by on my own
W: Always thought I was someone

W: Who won't sing with you
W: Give all of my mercy
W: Give all of my heart
W: Never thought that I'd miss you

W: I wish you health
W: And more than wealth

M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: I lit my love and watched it burn
W: Asking nothing in return
W: Except the lessons I will learn
W: By holding crazy faith
W: 
W: I've been touched by that bright fire
W: Down to the root of my desire
W: While the smoke it rises higher
W: On crazy faith
W: 
W: You're not asking if I love this man
W: I know you don't, you don't believe you can
W: Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
W: It's crazy I know
W: But my faith says so, it tells me
W: 
W: Am I a fool for hanging on?
W: Would I be a fool to be long gone?
W: When is daylight going to dawn
W: On my crazy faith?
W: 
W: The questions will not let me sleep
W: Answers buried way too deep
W: At the bottom of a lover's leap
W: Made by crazy faith
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: You're not asking if I love this man
W: I know you don't, you don't believe you can
W: Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
W: It's crazy I know, but my faith says so
W: It tells me
W: 
W: Love your losing, lose your love
W: Let the hawk fly from the glove
W: Then do not search the skies above
W: Search your crazy faith
W: 
W: Love is lightning, love is ice
W: It only strikes the lucky twice
W: Once, so you will know the price
W: And once for crazy faith
W: 
W: You're not asking if I love this man
W: I know you don't, you don't believe you can
W: Yet I've seen love open like a dancer's fan
W: It's crazy I know,
W: But my faith says so

W: Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.
W: Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.
W: Shade is dark.
W: Cool and languid for life or love.
W: Safe in shadows; never stark as the daylight.
W: As the daylight.
W: 
W: When I was just knee high,
W: My Momma told me, never try,
W: To be someone that I am not.
W: Yet over time I had forgot,
W: The wandering child, so lost at play:
W: He's found himself but he can't find his way,
W: In the daylight.
W: Oh, the daylight.
W: 
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Life is short, and there's no turning back the time.
W: Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb in the daylight.
W: In my mind,
W: There's a corner I need to turn.
W: Lessons lived is a lesson learned in the daylight.
W: In the daylight.
W: 
W: I miss the forest shade,
W: You took me there, the promise I made,
W: To never leave the dark so deep.
W: Safe and soothing, yet I fear,
W: As I recall and now reflect,
W: I see it's safer to connect,
W: To the daylight.
W: Oh, the daylight. (Light.)
W: 
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: Ooh, daylight.
W: 
W: Daylight falls and I'm lost in the big parade.
W: Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight.

W: Ohhh Im so tired
W: Ohhh Im so tired
W: 
W: So tired of the city days
W: Their frantic pace and their crazy ways
W: Life's too full to be rushing on by
W: When we are living and growing and breathing and thriving
W: 
W: I'm so tired of sitting in the park drinking
W: Numbing my senses, no more thinking
W: Comes a pattern well it's hard to break
W: Too much of fighting, too much of crying, too much of loosing
W: 
W: I need to clean the ?????   in my blood stream
W: And salt from the sea on my skin away
W: Not far to go today
W: Wait no more, its never too far
W: 
W: So tired of bureaucracy
W: The red tape that is binding me
W: I'm just one of the caretakers of our lives
W: I need a paper to hang a sign that says "Dave's Place"
W: 
W: I'm so tired of peoples lies
W: Breeding envy harm so many
W: Betrayal by false friends cuts hard
W: I treat every man as my brother, every woman as my sister
W: 
W: For United we can sustain our ways
W: Helping each as we fall away
W: Not far to go today
W: Wait no more, its never too far
W: 
W: Ohhh Im so tired
W: Ohhh Im so tired
W: 
W: So tired of the daily news
W: I find it quite distressing
W: The latest wars and people dying
W: For their religion, their country, their colour
W: Does it make us feel any better
W: 
W: So tired of what many people call love
W: Seem too self-possessing
W: I think that love's all about giving away everything you've got
W: Aint funny how a little can make you happy
W: 
W: And my life's become a jigsaw
W: 52 pieces for each year of my life
W: to the 1500 this week
W: I had another little ditty puzzle my mind
W: 
W: And I don't have the concentration
W: I'm not sure if I can work it all out
W: And if I live to be an age old man, well I still feel
W: that I will have my doubts about the outcome
W: 
W: And in my dreams I've only told the story
W: In my songs well I just dance in the rain but
W: And the time I spend with you right now
W: Is just a little bit of pleasure to ease my pain
W: 
W: And I'm getting tired of wandering
W: over hills and valleys mountains and plains
W: well comes a time in all our lives we find our place in the world
W: and a little thing called satisfaction
W: 
W: Sitting on a mudpile
W: Sitting on a mudpile
W: 
W: Im so tired of the daily news
W: 
W: Sitting on a mudpile
W: Sitting on a mudpile

W: 
W: That knights upon bended knee
W: 
W: And with vows no maiden’s heart could withstand
W: 
W: They pledged their faith to me
W: 
W: And I dreamt that one of the noble host
W: 
W: Came forth my hand to claim….but

W: 
W: Take care my foolish heart
W:

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Long, long ago, where the tall grass grows
W: 
W: and the still air is sweet with summer flowers;
W: 
W: in the shade by the stream I would lie awake and dream,
W: 
W: and in dreaming I would while away the hours.
W: 
W: Long, long gone yesterday,
W: 
W: and the castle and the prince and the God to whom I prayed.
W: 
W: Well, I made, and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses.
W: 
W: I'm tired of trying to be free.
W: 
W: Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W: 
W: Well, I wasted years,
W: 
W: all the useless, bitter tears.
W: 
W: If I'd known I'd have stopped it at the start.
W: 
W: I knew life was long,
W: 
W: and I knew life could go wrong,
W: 
W: but I never knew my life would break my heart.
W: 
W: Dreams die harder than pride.
W: 
W: I have learned my lesson well.
W: 
W: I will put them both aside.
W: 
W: 'Cause I made and I'm gonna lie in this bed of roses.
W: 
W: I'm tired and I'm dying to be free.
W: 
W: Gonna lay down like a sigh in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W: 
W: Roses die, and all the fairy tales are lies,
W: 
W: and I guess that's just too bad for poor old me.
W: 
W: 'Cause I made, and I'm gonna lie in my bed of roses.
W: 
W: Bed of roses I believed my life would be.
W:

W:

W: 
W: So spin the wheel of St.Columba's and ride his golden calf
W: Climb up the silver strings of the mandolin till you can hear the angels laugh
W: And if rock and roll is more your thing, go ahead and wear the badge
W: Cause chaos needs another king, a pillar of smoke who don't look back
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: I'm dirty and torn, my tails hung out, a ship with tattered sails
W: Been down and out, around the horn to chase the great white whale
W: Across the night and across the day, I save my song for eternity
W: Now here I find you gazing out of the window of St. James infirmary
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: So keep rollin', rollin' down that road you're on
W: Keep rollin', rollin' on, rollin' on
W: Keep rollin', rollin' down that road that you're on
W: Keep rollin', rollin', rollin' on

W: But that big city singin' man, I like the way that it shines
W: I was half a mile from Canada waitin' on a train
W: Wonderin' and wishin' I could disappear again
W: I been killed by love still it takes me to the end of the line
W: 
W: CHORUS

W: Well, I been troubled by a love untrue
W: He's a fool who'll drown in his fountain of youth
W: I can see that now as I'm walkin' and talkin' with you
W: Well, I been blinded by the sun, washed in the rain
W: Scattered in America, I'm scatterin' again
W: But if you're goin' south darlin, I guess I'm travelin' with you

V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: In every heart there is a room
W: 
W: A sanctuary safe and strong
W: 
W: To heal the wounds from lovers past
W: 
W: Until a new one comes along
W: 
W: I spoke to you in cautious tones
W: 
W: You answered me with no pretence
W: 
W: And still I feel I said too much
W: 
W: My silence is my self defense
W: 
W: And every time I’ve held a rose
W: 
W: It seems I only felt the thorns
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And so will you soon I suppose
W: 
W: But if my silence made you leave
W: 
W: Then that would be my worst mistake
W: 
W: So I will share this room with you
W: 
W: And you can have this heart to break
W: 
W: And this is why my eyes are closed
W: 
W: It’s just as well for all I’ve seen
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And you’re the only one who knows
W: 
W: So I would choose to be with you
W: 
W: That’s if the choice were mine to make
W: 
W: But you can make decisions too
W: 
W: And you can have this heart to break
W: 
W: And so it goes, and so it goes
W: 
W: And you’re the only one who knows

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Here is a story about a sinner,
W: He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,
W: But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,
W: And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,
W: It turned him to the booze,
W: And he got mixed up with a floosie
W: And she led him to a life of indecision.
W: The floosie made him spend his dole
W: She left him lying on Skid Row
W: A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.
W: It's such a shame.
W: 
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Sad memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would say,
W: Damn it all and blow it all,
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.
W: 
W: Barley wine pink gin,
W: He'll drink anything,
W: Port, Pernod or tequila,
W: Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,
W: As long as all his troubles disappeared.
W: But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife,
W: And the floosie's gone and found another sucker
W: She's gonna turn him on to drink
W: She's gonna lead him to the brink
W: And when his money's gone,
W: She'll leave him in the gutter,
W: 
W: It's such a shame.
W: Oh demon alcohol,
W: Sad memories I cannot recall,
W: Who thought I would fall,
W: A slave to demon alcohol.

W: 
W: It’s not often that time turns itself around
W: 
W: And you watch your shadow pass you by
W: 
W: Every minute, every move, every single sound
W: 
W: Takes on meaning to your eye
W: 
W: In the summer breeze of cool and sandy beach towns
W: 
W: I stood alone again and cried
W: 
W: Days rolled by, and they were warm and hot and round
W: 
W: I looked for answers in the sky
W: 
W: Now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine
W: 
W: Don’t you tend to wander in some distant daze
W: 
W: When all you’ve worked for tumbles down
W: 
W: You’re and actor in some far away movie haze
W: 
W: You clutch your heart as you hit the ground
W: 
W: But now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine
W: 
W: Hearts are worth the mending, though they heal up slowly
W: 
W: Every beat hits soft and low
W: 
W: Comes a time when all the pain and hurt is ending
W: 
W: And your heart gets up to go
W: 
W: In the autumn, it was winter’s watch I was keeping
W: 
W: And the world was brown and gold
W: 
W: You crept on in and kissed me while I lay there sleeping
W: 
W: And handed me a lover’s rose
W: 
W: Now you’re holding me through the night
W: 
W: Holding me in a brand new light
W: 
W: Holding me through the night
W: 
W: And I’m fine

V:1 
W: 
W: I hear the train a coming, it’s rolling ‘round the bend
W: 
W: And I ain’t seen the sunshine since I don’t know when
W: 
W: I’m stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
W: 
W: But that train keeps on rolling, down to San Antone
W: 
W: When I was just a baby, my mama told me Son
W: 
W: Always be a good boy, don’t ever play with guns
W: 
W: But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
W: 
W: When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
W: 
W: I bet there’s rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
W: 
W: They’re prob’ly drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
W: 
W: But I know I had it coming, I know I can’t be free
W: 
W: But those people keep a-moving, and that’s what tortures me
W: 
W: Will if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
W: 
W: I bet I’d move over a little further down the line
W: 
W: Far from Folsom Prison, that’s where I want to stay
W: 
W: And I’d let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

W: 
W: All that I have is a river                       C   -  G  - F  -  Am  - E. - Dm
W: The river is always my home
W: Lord, take me away
W: For I just cannot stay
W: Or I'll sink in my skin and my bones
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: The water sustains me without even trying
W: The water can't drown me, I'm done
W: With my dying
W: 
W: Please help me build a small boat
W: One that'll ride on the flow
W: Where the river runs deep
W: And the larger fish creep
W: I'm glad of what keeps me afloat
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Now deeper the water I sail
W: And faster the current I'm in
W: That each night brings the stars
W: And the song in my heart
W: Is a tune for the journeyman's tale
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: Now the land that I knew is a dream
W: And the line on the distance grows faint
W: So wide is my river
W: The horizon a sliver
W: The artist has run out of paint
W: 
W: Where the blue of the sea meets the sky
W: And the big yellow sun leads me home
W: I'm everywhere now
W: The way is a vow
W: To the wind of each breath by and by

W: Come over here, babe
W: It ain't that bad
W: I don't claim to understand
W: The troubles that you've had
W: But the dogs you say they fed you to
W: Lay their muzzles in your lap
W: And the lions that they led you to
W: Lie down and take a nap
W: The ones you fear are wind and air
W: And I love you without measure
W: It seems we can be happy now
W: Be it better late than never
W: 
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come to me
W: 
W: The burdens that you carry now
W: Are not of your creation
W: So let's not weep for their evil deeds
W: But for their lack of imagination
W: Today's the time for courage, babe
W: Tomorrow can be for forgiving
W: And if he touches you again with his stupid hands
W: His life won't be worth living
W: 
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come
W: Sweetheart, come to me
W: 
W: Walk with me now under the stars
W: For it's a clear and easy pleasure
W: And be happy in my company
W: For I love you without measure
W: Walk with me now under the stars
W: It's a safe and easy pleasure
W: It seems we can be happy now
W: It's late but it ain't never
W: It's late but it ain't never
W: It's late but it ain't never Come over here, babe

W: Looking out on the morning rain
W: 
W: I used to feel uninspired
W: 
W: And when I knew I had to face another day
W: 
W: Lord, it made me feel so tired
W: 
W: Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
W: 
W: But your love was the key to peace my mind
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
W: 
W: A natural woman
W: 
W: When my soul was in the lost-and-found
W: 
W: You came along to claim it
W: 
W: I didn't know just what was wrong with me
W: 
W: Till your kiss helped me name it
W: 
W: Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
W: 
W: Cause if I make you happy I don't need no more
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
W: 
W: A natural woman
W: 
W: Oh, baby, what you've done to me
W: 
W: You make me feel so good inside
W: 
W: And I just want to be close to you
W: 
W: You make me fell so alive
W: 
W: Cause you make me feel, you make me feel, you make me feel like
W: 
W: A natural woman

V:1 
W: 
W: Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
W: But how can they know it's time for them to go?
W: Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
W: I have no thought of time
W: 
W: For who knows where the time goes?
W: Who knows where the time goes?
W: 
W: Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
W: Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
W: But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
W: I do not count the time
W: 
W: For who knows where the time goes?
W: Who knows where the time goes?
W: 
W: And I am not alone while my love is near me
W: I know it will be so until it's time to go
W: So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
W: I have no fear of time
W: 
W: For who knows how my love grows?
W: And who knows where the time goes?

W: Trouble and trials often betray those
W: On in the weary body to stray
W: But we shall walk beside the still waters
W: With the good shepherd leading the way
W: 
W: Those who have strayed were sought by the master
W: He who once gave his life for the sheep
W: Out on the mountain still he is seaching
W: Bringing them in forever to keep
W: 
W: 
W: Going up home to live in green pastures
W: Where we shall live and die never more
W: Even the Lord will be in that number
W: When we shall reach that heavenly shore
W: 
W: SOLO
W: 
W: We will not heed the voice of a stranger
W: For he would lead us all to despair
W: Following on with Jesus our savior
W: We shall all reach that country so fair
W: 
W: Going up home to live in green pastures
W: Where we shall live and die never more
W: Even the Lord will be in that number
W: When we shall reach that heavenly shore

T: Love Song To A Stranger
C:Joan Baez
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: How long since I've spent a whole night in a twin bed with a stranger
W: 
W: his warm arms all around me
W: 
W: How long since I've gazed into dark eyes that melted my soul down
W: 
W: to a place where it longed to be?
W: 
W: All of your history has little to do with your face;
W: 
W: You're mainly a mystery with violins filling in space.
W: 
W: You stood in the nude by the mirror and picked out a rose
W: 
W: from the bouquet in our hotel
W: 
W: And laid down beside me again, and I watched the rose
W: 
W: on the pillow as it fell.
W: 
W: I sank and I slept in a twilight with only one care -
W: 
W: To know that when day broke and I woke that you'd still be there.
W: 
W: The hours, for once, they passed slowly, unendingly by
W: 
W: Like a sweet breeze on a field;
W: 
W: Your gentleness came down upon me and I guess I thanked you
W: 
W: when you caused me to yield
W: 
W: We spoke not a sentence and took not a footstep beyond
W: 
W: our two days together which seemingly soon would be gone.
W: 
W: Don't tell me of love everlasting -  and other sad dreams -
W: 
W: I don't want to hear.
W: 
W: Just tell me of passionate strangers who rescue each other
W: 
W: from a lifetime of cares.
W: 
W: And if love means forever, expecting nothing returned,
W: 
W: Then I hope I'll be given another whole lifetime to learn.
W: 
W: 'cause I took from you oh so many things, it makes me wonder
W: 
W: how they could belong to me,
W: 
W: And I gave you only my dark eyes which melted your soul down
W: 
W: to a place where it longed to be -

W: Joan Baez Prison Trilogy Lyrics                (Words and Music by Joan
W: Baez)
W: 
W: Billy Rose was a low rider, Billy Rose was a night fighter
W: 
W: Billy Rose knew trouble like the sound of his own name
W: 
W: Busted on a drunken charge
W: 
W: Driving someone else's car
W: 
W: The local midnight sheriff's claim to fame
W: 
W: In an Arizona jail there are some who tell the tale how
W: 
W: Billy fought the sergeant for some milk that he demanded
W: 
W: Knowing they'd remain the boss
W: 
W: Knowing he would pay the cost
W: 
W: They saw he was severely reprimanded
W: 
W: In the blackest cell on "A" Block
W: 
W: He hanged himself at dawn
W: 
W: With a note stuck to the bunk head
W: 
W: Don't mess with me, just take me home
W: 
W: Come and lay, help us lay young Billy down
W: 
W: Luna was a Mexican the law called an alien
W: 
W: For coming across the border with a baby and a wife
W: 
W: Though the clothes upon his back were wet
W: 
W: Still he thought that he could get
W: 
W: Some money and things to start a life
W: 
W: It hadn't been too very long when it seemed like everything went wrong
W: 
W: They didn't even have the time to find themselves a home
W: 
W: This foreigner, a brown-skin male
W: 
W: Thrown into a Texas jail
W: 
W: It left the wife and baby quite alone
W: 
W: He eased the pain inside him
W: 
W: With a needle in his arm
W: 
W: But the dope just crucified him
W: 
W: He died to no one's great alarm
W: 
W: Come and lay, help us lay Young Luna down
W: 
W: And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons To the ground
W: 
W: Kilowatt was an aging con of 65 who stood a chance to stay alive
W: 
W: And leave the joint and walk the streets again
W: 
W: As the time he was to leave drew near
W: 
W: He suffered all the joy and fear
W: 
W: Of leaving 35 years in the pen
W: 
W: And on the day of his release he was approached by the police
W: 
W: Who took him to the warden walking slowly by his side
W: 
W: The warden said "You won't remain here
W: 
W: But it seems a state retainer
W: 
W: Claims another 10 years of your life."
W: 
W: He stepped out in the Texas sunlight
W: 
W: The cops all stood around
W: 
W: Old Kilowatt ran 50 yards
W: 
W: Then threw himself down on the ground
W: 
W: They might as well just have laid The old man down
W: 
W: And we're gonna raze, raze the prisons To the ground
W: 
W: Help us raze, raze the prisons To the ground

W: It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
W: Event if you don't know by now
W: And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
W: It'll never do somehow
W: When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
W: Look out your window and I'll be gone
W: You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
W: But don't think twice, it's all right
W: 
W: And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
W: That light I never knowed
W: And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
W: I'm on the dark side of the road
W: But I wish there was something you would do or say
W: To try and make me change my mind and stay
W: But we never did too much talking anyway
W: But don't think twice, it's all right
W: 
W: So there ain't no use in calling out my name
W: Like you never done before
W: And it ain't no use in calling out my name
W: I can't hear you anymore
W: I'm a-thinking and a-wondering walking down the road
W: I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
W: I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
W: But don't think twice, it's all right
W: 
W: So long honey, babe
W: Where I'm bound, I can't tell
W: Goodbye's too good a word, babe
W: So I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
W: I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
W: You could've done better but I don't mind
W: You just kinda wasted my precious time
W: But don't think twice, it's all right

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: The tears of a woman are hidden within
W: As she moves from one to the next, her spirit grows thin
W: And when she falls in love with one, it's hard but it's true
W: But it's oh so much harder when that man is you
W: 
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown
W: 
W: One stormy day I was out at sea
W: The waves they rolled and tumbled over me
W: I spied dry land and a tall pale tree
W: I knew that soon that's where I'd like to be
W: 
W: My sweetheart left me for another one
W: And now I wait for the next rising sun
W: 
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't drown
W: I got lost on the river, but I didn't go down
W: I got lost on the river, but I got found

W: You're riding high in April
W: Shot down in May
W: But I know I'm gonna change that tune
W: When I'm back on top, back on top in June
W: 
W: I said that's life
W: And as funny as it may seem
W: Some people get their kicks
W: Stomping on a dream
W: But I don't let it, let it get me down
W: 'Cause this fine old world
W: It keeps spinning around
W: 
W: I've been a puppet, a pauper,
W: A pirate, a poet,
W: A pawn and a king,
W: I've been up and down and over and out
W: And I know one thing
W: Each time I find myself
W: Flat on my face
W: I pick myself up and get back in the race
W: 
W: That's life
W: I tell you, I can't deny it
W: I thought of quitting baby
W: But my heart just ain't gonna buy it
W: And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
W: I'd jump right on a big bird
W: And then I'd fly
W: 
W: I've been a puppet, a pauper,
W: A pirate, a poet,
W: A pawn and a king,
W: I've been up and down and over and out
W: And I know one thing
W: Each time I find myself laying
W: Flat on my face
W: I just pick myself up and get back in the race
W: 
W: That's life
W: That's life, and I can't deny it
W: Many times I thought of cutting out
W: But my heart won't buy it
W: But if there nothing shaking coming this here July
W: I'm going to roll myself up in a big ball
W: And die...

W: 
W: Turn me loose from your hands
W: Let me fly to distant lands
W: Over green fields, trees and mountains
W: Flowers and forest fountains
W: Home along the lanes of the skyway
W: 
W: For this dark and lonely room
W: Projects a shadow cast in gloom
W: And my eyes are mirrors
W: Of the world outside

W: That the wind can turn the tide
W: And these shadows turn
W: From purple into grey
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: For just a skyline pigeon
W: Dreaming of the open
W: Waiting for the day
W: That he can spread his wings
W: And fly away again
W: Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
W: Towards the dreams
W: You've left so very far behind
W: Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
W: Towards the dreams
W: You've left so very far behind
W: 
W: Let me wake up in the morning
W: To the smell of new mowed hay
W: To laugh and cry, to live and die
W: In the brightness of my day
W: I wanna hear the pealing bells
W: Of distant churches sing
W: But most of all please free me from
W: This aching metal ring
W: And open out this cage towards the sun

W: I ploughed through them fields of fire
W: Had a needle in a vein, that profited the sane

W: Give you that peace of the evening

W: The rains and the change of each season
W: 
W: I saw people who were trapped
W: Under the whip of fat cats
W: Saw people there devoid of their Dreaming
W: Deep down inside there with so much to hide
W: Brother you could see in their eyes there's no meaning
W: So take me my sisters and welcome me home
W: So I never again walk alone
W: Our spirit demands that we die in this land
W: And I know now my spirit's come home

W: Lived with people in chains, the wounded and lame
W: Heard Messiahs who spoke without knowin'
W: And them seven seas rose and the desert lands froze
W: Each individual there was trapped in a prison
W: And my spirit cried out, to know what it's about, brother
W: Their basis had no rhyme or no reason

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: 
W: I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the
W: ashtray
W: 
W: Lying cold the way you left them,  but at least your lips caressed them
W: while, you packed
W: 
W: Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and
W: didn’t drink
W: 
W: But at least you thought you wanted it,
W: 
W: that’s so much more than I can say for me
W: 
W: What a good year for the roses
W: 
W: Many blooms still linger there
W: 
W: The lawn could stand another mowing
W: 
W: Funny I don’t even care
W: 
W: As you turn to walk away
W: 
W: As the door behind you closes
W: 
W: The only thing I have to say
W: 
W: Its been a good year for the roses
W: 
W: After three full years of marriage,
W: 
W: it’s the first time that you haven’t made the bed
W: 
W: I guess the reason were not talking,
W: 
W: there’s so little left to say we haven’t said
W: 
W: While a million thoughts go racing through my mind,
W: 
W: I find I haven’t said a word
W: 
W: From the bedroom the familiar sound of a baby’s crying goes unheard
W: 
W: Bridge

W: I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
W: And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you
W: 
W: We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
W: Sweet memories will last a long, long time
W: We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry

B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
W: I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
W: Who will dance on the floor in the round
W: She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
W: 
W: She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
W: Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
W: Who will dance on the floor in the round
W: 
W: People always told me be careful of what you do
W: And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
W: And mother always told me be careful of who you love
W: And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son
W: She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
W: 
W: For forty days and forty nights
W: The law was on her side
W: But who can stand when she's in demand
W: Her schemes and plans
W: 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
W: So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
W: (Don't think twice, don't think twice)
W: 
W: She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
W: Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
W: 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
W: 
W: People always told me be careful of what you do
W: And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
W: She came and stood right by me
W: Just the smell of sweet perfume
W: This happened much too soon
W: She called me to her room
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son

W: She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
W: But the kid is not my son
W: She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
W: She says I am the one,
W: 
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
W: Billie Jean is not my lover
W: Billie Jean is not my lover

W: You and your smile hold a strange invitation
W: Somehow it seems
W: We've shed our dream but we're
W: Time after time in a room full of strangers
W: Out of the blue, suddenly you were there
W: 
W: 
W: Wherever I go you're the glow of temptation,
W: Glancing my way in the grey of the dawn
W: And always your smile holds that strange invitation
W: Then you are gone
W: Where oh where have you gone
W: 
W: 
W: How long must I live in a world of illusion
W: Be where you are so near yet so far, apart
W: Hoping you'll say with a sweet invitation
W: Where have you been, darling come in
W: Into my heart

W: 
W: We don't all die young to save our spark
W: From the ravages of time
W: But the first and last to leave their mark
W: Someday become the traveling kind
W: 
W: In the wind are names of poets past
W: Some were friends of yours and mine
W: And to those unsung, we lift our glass
W: May their songs become the traveling kind
W: 
W: We were born to brave this tilted world
W: With our hearts laid on the line
W: Be it way-crossed boy or red dirt girl
W: The song becomes the traveling kind
W: 
W: There are mountains worth their weight in gold
W: Mere mortals dare not climb
W: Come ye tipsy, sainted, sinners both
W: And claim them for the traveling kind
W: 
W: When the music slowly starts to fade
W: Into the light's last soft decline
W: Let us lie down in that evening shade
W: And rest among the traveling kind
W: And the song goes on for the traveling kind

W: 
W: But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
W: 
W: You can raise welts like nobody else
W: 
W: As we dance to the masochism tango

W: / Em - Am - / D7 - G - / B7 - Em - / B7 - Em - /
W: 
W: Let our love be a flame, not an ember
W:

W: 
W: Blacken my eye, set fire to my tie
W: 
W: As we dance to the masochism tango
W: 
W: / " / " / B7 - Em Am / B7 - Em - /
W: 
W: At your command before you here I stand
W: 
W: My heart is in my hand - yecch
W: 
W: It's here that I must be
W: 
W: My heart entreats, just hear those savage beats
W: 
W: And go put on your cleats and come and trample me
W: 
W: / Am D7 G / Em Am / Ebdim7 E E7 / Am D7 G / Em Am D7 G B7 /
W: 
W: Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
W: 
W: That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
W: 
W: My soul is on fire, it's aflame with desire
W: 
W: Which is why I perspire when we tango
W: 
W: You caught my nose
W: 
W: In your left castanet, love
W: 
W: I can feel the pain yet, love
W: 
W: Ev'ry time I hear drums
W: 
W: And I envy the rose
W: 
W: That you held in your teeth, love
W: 
W: With the thorns underneath, love
W: 
W: Sticking into your gums
W: 
W: / C C7 / F - / B7 - / Em - / 1st, 2nd, 3rd / B7 - /
W: 
W: Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
W: 
W: The last time I needed twenty stitches
W: 
W: To sew up the gash that you made with your lash
W: 
W: As we danced to the masochism tango
W: 
W: Bash in my brain and make me scream with pain
W: 
W: Then kick me once again and say we'll never part
W: 
W: I know too well I'm underneath your spell
W: 
W: So, Darling, if you smell something burning, it's my heart
W: 
W: Hic! Excuse me
W: 
W: Take your cigarette from its holder
W: 
W: And burn your initials in my shoulder
W: 
W: Fracture my spine and swear that you're mine
W: 
W: As we dance to the maso-chism tango

W: The words I have to say
W: May well be simple but they're true
W: Until you give your love
W: There's nothing more that we can do
W: 
W: Love is the opening door
W: Love is what we came here for
W: No one could offer you more
W: Do you know what I mean
W: Have your eyes really seen
W: 
W: You say it's very hard
W: To leave behind the life we knew
W: But there's no other way
W: And now it's really up to you
W: 
W: Love is the key we must turn
W: Truth is the flame we must burn
W: Freedom the lesson we must learn
W: Do you know what I mean
W: Have your eyes really seen
W: 
W: Love is the opening door
W: Love is what we came here for
W: No one could offer you more
W: Do you know what I mean

M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: It's up in the morning and on the downs
W: Little white clouds like gambolling lambs
W: And I am breathless over you
W: 
W: And the red-breasted robin beats his wings
W: His throat it trembles when he sings
W: For he is helpless before you
W: 
W: The happy hooded bluebells bow
W: And bend their heads all a-down
W: Heavied by the early morning dew
W: 
W: At the whispering stream, at the bubbling brook
W: The fishes leap up to take a look
W: For they are breathless over you
W: 
W: Still your hands
W: And still your heart
W: For still your face comes shining through
W: And all the morning glows anew
W: 
W: Still your mind
W: Still your soul
W: For still, the fare of love is true
W: And I am breathless without you
W: 
W: The wind circles among the trees
W: And it bangs about the new-made leaves
W: For it is breathless without you
W: 
W: The fox chases the rabbit round
W: The rabbit hides beneath the ground
W: For he is defenceless without you
W: 
W: The sky of daytime dies away
W: And all the earthly things they stop to play
W: For we are all breathless without you
W: 
W: I listen to my juddering bones
W: The blood in my veins and the wind in my lungs
W: And I am breathless without you
W: 
W: Still your hands
W: And still your heart
W: For still your face comes shining through
W: And all the morning glows anew
W: 
W: Still your soul
W: Still your mind
W: Still, the fire of love is true
W: And I am breathless without you

W: 
W: You may dig winter time but spring is my joy

W: 
W: It’s something special havn’t you observed
W: 
W: It makes you glad to be alive
W: 
W: It’s not absurd
W: 
W: to say that spring helps you survive
W: 
W: The winter’s long miserable cold and rain
W: 
W: it gives you hope to know that spring will get a refrain
W: 
W: You only have to believe the day is coming
W: 
W: The world is humming thinkin’ about how good it’ll be
W:

W: I was born on the path of the winter wind
W: Raised where the mountains are old
W: The springtime waters came dancing down,
W: I remember the tales they told.
W: Well the whistling ways of my younger days
W: too quickly have faded on by,
W: And all of my memories linger on
W: Like the light in the fading sky.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: River take me along in your sunshine sing me a song,
W: Ever moving, and winding and free,
W: You rolling old river, you changing old river,
W: Let's you and me river, run down to the sea.
W: 
W: Well I've been to the city and I've been back again,
W: I've been moved by some things that I've learned,
W: Met a lot of good people and I called them friends,
W: Felt the change when the seasons turned.
W: I've heard all of the songs that the children sing
W: And listened to love's melodies,
W: Felt my own music within me rise,
W: Like the wind in the Autumn breeze..
W: 
W: Chorus
W: Well some day when the flowers are blooming still,
W: Some day when the grass is still green,
W: The rolling waters will round me bend and flow into the open sea.
W: So here's to the rainbow that's followed me here
W: And here's to the friends that I know,
W: And here's to the song that's within me now,
W: I will sing it where e're I go.
W: 
W: Last Chorus
W: 
W: Repeat: You rolling old river, you changing old river
W: let's you and me river........ hold run down to the
W: sea slow
W: Can have one person saying you rolling old river, other person says you
W: changing old river.

W: With songs they have sung for a thousand years
W: The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
W: My heart wants to sing every song it hears
W: My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
W: That rise from the lake to the trees

W: From a church on a breeze
W: To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
W: Stones on its way
W: To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray
W: 
W: I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
W: I know I will hear what I've heard before
W: My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
W: And I'll sing once more

W: And I'm done try'na be the one,
W: Picking up the broken pieces.
W: And I'm done try'na be the one,
W: Who says I love you dear.
W: But I'm leaving.
W: 
W: Now you only bring me black roses.
W: And they crumble in the dust when they're held.
W: Now you only bring me black roses
W: But I'm not under your spell,
W: I'm not under your spell,
W: I'm not under your spell,
W: I'm not under your spell,
W: I'm not under your spell.

W: Dbm               A
W: I can see your eyes staring into mine
W: E                           B
W: But it's a battlefield, and I'm on the other side
W: Dbm                  A
W: You can throw your words sharper than a knife
W: E                        B
W: And leave me cold in another house on fire
W: 
W: 
W: Dbm    A        E
W: I lay low, lay low

W: Dbm                   A
W: She told me twice all of her good advice
W: E                            B
W: But I couldn't see, I was clouded by your lies
W: Dbm                   A
W: Up in smoke, a vision she foretold
W: E                                 B
W: She said stay away because that boy's a warning sign
W: 
W:

W: I hate you, I love you
W: 
W: Leave, please
W: 
W: Don't go away
W: 
W: Can't decide if
W: 
W: I like your face
W: 
W: Or if I wish
W: 
W: It would stray
W: 
W: 2)

W: You're a child but
W: 
W: You're malicious
W: 
W: You're sweet but
W: 
W: Don't remember my name
W: 
W: And heads you win
W: 
W: And tails I'm lost
W: 
W: And love equals pain
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: 
W: I am drifting
W: 
W: Without an anchor
W: 
W: Through your ambigous region
W: 
W: A strange continent
W: 
W: Immune to all reason
W: 
W: And I'm flattered by
W: 
W: Your grey matter
W: 
W: 3)
W: 
W: Inside my skin
W: 
W: I feel your tongue
W: 
W: Telling me I'm dirty
W: 
W: And licking my bones
W:

W: And I do not understand
W:

W: 
W: Just love a man
W: 
W: 4)
W: 
W: You're amusing
W: 
W: You're a real cool show
W: 
W: With your meat hooks
W: 
W: And barbed wire carnival
W: 
W: You got glitter in your pocket
W: 
W: You got mothballs in your soul
W: 
W: From too many false teeth
W: 
W: And greasy flash bulbs

V:1 
W: 
W: If life is a river and your heart is a boat
W: And just like a water baby, baby born to float
W: And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high
W: And your heart is Amelia dying to fly
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: And if life is a bar room in which we must wait
W: 'Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates
W: Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates
W: And we stack all the dead men in self-addressed crates
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day
W: When fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails
W: And your spirit's a slave to man's whips and man's jails
W: Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right
W: Then your heart is a pure flame of man's constant night
W: 
W: In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark
W: That somehow this black night
W: Feels warmer for the spark
W: Warmer for the spark
W: To hold us 'til the day when fear will lose its grip
W: And heaven has its way
W: And heaven has its way
W: When all will harmonise
W: And know it's in our hearts
W: The dream will realise
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes
W: Heaven knows no frontiers
W: And I've seen heaven in your eyes

W: I met two angels but they were in disguise
W: Took one look to realize
W: Tell them anything and they will sympathize
W: These arms hold me tight
W: 
W: Old fears, helped to ease them in my mind
W: New tears say that they will dry in time
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: Hallelujah
W: 
W: Laughing together like our thoughts are harmonized
W: Been that way since '95
W: Give me direction when it is hard to fight
W: Three roads, one light
W: 
W: Now and then I can lean my back to yours
W: Traveling like our feet don't touch the floor
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: 
W: I had a best friend but she has come to pass
W: One I wish I could see now
W: You always remind me that memories will last
W: These arms reach out
W: 
W: You were there to protect me like a shield
W: Long hair running with me through the field
W: Everywhere you've been with me all along
W: 
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Why me? How'd I get this hallelujah?
W: Hallelujah

V:1 
W: 
W: You don’t know what love is
W: 
W: Until you’ve learnt the meaning of the blues
W: 
W: Until you’ve loved a love you’ve had to lose
W: 
W: You don’t know what love is
W: 
W: You don’t know how lips hurt
W: 
W: Until you’ve kissed and had to pay the cost
W: 
W: Until you’ve flipped your heart and you have lost
W: 
W: You don’t know what love is
W: 
W: Do you know how a lost heart fears
W: 
W: The thought of reminiscing
W: 
W: And how lips that taste of tears
W: 
W: Lose their taste for kissing
W: 
W: You don’t know how hearts burn
W: 
W: For love that cannot live yet never dies
W: 
W: Until you’ve faced each dawn with sleepless nights
W: 
W: You don’t know what love is

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: It's a god-awful small affair
W: 
W: To the girl with the mousy hair
W: 
W: But her mummy is yelling "No"
W: 
W: And her daddy has told her to go
W: 
W: But her friend is nowhere to be seen
W: 
W: Now she walks through her sunken dream
W: 
W: To the seat with the clearest view
W: 
W: And she's hooked to the silver screen
W: 
W: But the film is a saddening bore
W: 
W: For she's lived it ten times or more
W: 
W: She could spit in the eyes of fools
W: 
W: As they ask her to focus on
W: 
W: Sailors fighting in the dance hall
W: 
W: Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
W: 
W: It's the freakiest show
W: 
W: Take a look at the Lawman
W: 
W: Beating up the wrong guy
W: 
W: Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
W: 
W: He's in the best selling show
W: 
W: Is there life on Mars?
W: 
W: It's on Amerika's tortured brow
W: 
W: That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
W: 
W: Now the workers have struck for fame
W: 
W: 'Cause Lennon's on sale again
W: 
W: See the mice in their million hordes
W: 
W: From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
W: 
W: Rule Britannia is out of bounds
W: 
W: To my mother, my dog, and clowns
W: 
W: But the film is a saddening bore
W: 
W: 'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
W: 
W: It's about to be writ again
W: 
W: As I ask you to focus on
W: 
W: Sailors fighting in the dance hall

W: Oh man! Look at those cavemen go

W: I won't try to cheer you up,
W: 
W: I'll just be here If you want me.
W: 
W: It's no use in keeping a stiff upper lip,
W: 
W: You can weep, you can sleep
W: 
W: You can loosen your grip.
W: 
W: You can frown, you can drown
W:

W: 
W: Its something to me you don't need to explain.
W:

W: 
W: I'll draw all the curtains,
W: 
W: And unplug the phone
W: 
W: You can cry if you want to.
W: 
W: You can stare at the ceiling,
W: 
W: And tear at your hair,
W: 
W: Swallow your feelings,
W: 
W: And stagger and swear.
W: 
W: You can show things and throw things
W: 
W: and I wouldn't care.

W: You can cry if you want to.
W: 
W: I won't make fun of you.
W: 
W: I won't tell anyone.
W: 
W: I won't analyze what you do

W: Well its empty and ugly
W: 
W: And terribly sad.
W: 
W: I can't feel what you feel,
W: 
W: But I know it feels bad.

W: I know that its real
W: 
W: And it makes you so mad.

C:Nanci Griffith
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Baby I know that we've got trouble in the fields
W: When the bankers swarm like locust out there turning away our yield
W: The trains roll by our silos, silver in the rain
W: They leave our pockets full of nothing, but our dreams and the golden grain
W: 
W: Have you seen the folks in line downtown at the station
W: They're all buying their ticket out and talking the great depression
W: Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
W: When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: And all this trouble in our fields
W: If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
W: They'll never take our native soil
W: 
W: But if we sell that new John Deere
W: And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears
W: You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
W: Come harvest time we'll work it out
W: There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields
W: 
W: There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
W: And there's a little bit of you and a little bit of me in the photos on every page
W: Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
W: They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Repeat
W: You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
W: Come harvest time we'll work it out
W: There's still a lot of love, here in these troubled fields

W: I took a trip on a train
W: 
W: And I thought about you
W: 
W: I passed a shadowy lane
W: 
W: And I thought about you
W: 
W: Two or three cars arked under the stars
W: 
W: A winding stream
W: 
W: Moon shining down on some little town
W: 
W: And with each beam, the same old dream
W: 
W: And every stop that we made, oh, I thought about you
W: 
W: When I pulled down the shade then I really felt blue
W: 
W: I peeked through the crack, looked at the track
W: 
W: The one going back to you
W: 
W: And what did I do? I thought about you

T: Whisper Not
C:Benny Golson
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Sing low, Sing clear,  Sweet words in my ear
W: 
W: Not a whisper of despair, But love's own prayer
W: 
W: Sing on, until, You bring back the thrill
W: 
W: Of a sentimental tune, That died too soon
W: 
W: Our harmony was lost
W: 
W: But you forgave, I forgot
W: 
W: Whisper not of quarrels past
W: 
W: You know we've had our last
W: 
W: So now, we'll be,  On key constantly
W: 
W: Love will whisper on eternally
W: 
W: Why did we listen when they said it wouldn't last
W: 
W: Gossiping voices made us break up, but you know we still can make up
W: 
W: If we forget 'em all, and answer Cupid's call
W: 
W: It's the truth!
W: 
W: Whispers of troubles are an echo of the past
W: 
W: All it will take to lose my gloom is just a whisper not of rumours
W: 
W: But of your love for me, That's how it's got to be

W: 
W: 
W: i am out here studying stones
W: trying to learn to be less alive
W: using all of my will
W: to keep very still
W: still even on the inside
W: 
W: i've cut all of the pertinent wires
W: so my eyes cant make that connection
W: i am holding my breath
W: i'm feigning my death
W: when i'm looking in your direction
W: 
W: course numb is an old hat
W: old as my oldest memories
W: see that one's my mother
W: and that one's my father
W: and that one in the hat, thats me
W: it's a skill i hoped to abandon
W: when i got out on the open road
W: but any more pent up emotion
W: i think i'm gonna explode
W: 
W: there's never been an endeavor so strange
W: as trying to slow the blood in my veins
W: to keep my face blank
W: as a stone that just sank
W: until not a ripple remains
W: i am high above the tree line
W: sitting cross legged on the ground
W: when all of the forbidden fruit has fallen and rotted
W: well that's when i'm gonna come down
W: 
W: course numb is an old hat
W: old as my oldest memories
W: see that one's my mother
W: and that one's my father
W: and that one in the hat, that's me
W: it's a skill i hoped to abandon
W: when i got out on the open road

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: I was an unmarried girl
W: 
W: I'd just turned twenty-seven
W: 
W: When they sent me to the sisters
W: 
W: For the way men looked at me
W: 
W: Branded as a jezebel
W: 
W: I knew I was not bound for Heaven
W: 
W: I'd be cast in shame
W: 
W: Into the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Most girls come here pregnant
W: 
W: Some by their own fathers
W: 
W: Bridget got that belly
W: 
W: By her parish priest
W: 
W: We're trying to get things white as snow
W: 
W: All of us woe-begotten-daughters
W: 
W: In the steaming stains
W: 
W: Of the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Prostitutes and destitutes
W: 
W: And temptresses like me--
W: 
W: Fallen women--
W: 
W: Sentenced into dreamless drudgery ...
W: 
W: Why do they call this heartless place
W: 
W: Our Lady of Charity?
W: 
W: Oh charity!
W: 
W: These bloodless brides of Jesus
W: 
W: If they had just once glimpsed their groom
W: 
W: Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
W: 
W: Concealed behind their rosaries
W: 
W: They wilt the grass they walk upon
W: 
W: They leech the light out of a room
W: 
W: They'd like to drive us down the drain
W: 
W: At the Magdalene laundries
W: 
W: Peg O'Connell died today
W: 
W: She was a cheeky girl
W: 
W: A flirt
W: 
W: They just stuffed her in a hole!
W: 
W: Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
W: 
W: One day I'm going to die here too
W: 
W: And they'll plant me in the dirt
W: 
W: Like some lame bulb
W: 
W: That never blooms come any spring
W: 
W: Not any spring
W: 
W: No, not any spring
W: 
W: Not any spring

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: I am an old woman named after my mother
W: My old man is another child that's grown old
W: If dreams were lightning, thunder were desire
W: This old house would have burnt down a long time ago
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery
W: Make me a poster of an old rodeo
W: Just give me one thing that I can hold on to
W: To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
W: 
W: When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy
W: He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man
W: But that was a long time and no matter how I try
W: The years just flow by like a broken-down dam
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing
W: And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today
W: How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
W: And come home in the evening and have nothing to say

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: She went over to his apartment clutching her decision
W: and he said, did you come here to tell me goodbye?
W: so she built a skyscraper of procrastination
W: and then she leaned out the twenty-fifth floor window of her reply
W: and she felt like an actress just reading her lines
W: when she finally said yes. it's really goodbye this time
W: and far below was the blacktop and the tiny toy cars
W: and it all fell so fast and it all fell so far
W: and she said:
W: 
W: you are a miracle but that is not all
W: you are also a stiff drink and i am on call
W: you are a party and i am a school night
W: and i'm lookin' for my door key, but you are my porch light
W: and you'll never know, dear just how much i loved you
W: you'll probably think this was just my big excuse
W: but i stand committed to a love that came before you
W: and the fact that i adore you is but one of my truths
W: 
W: what of the mother whose house is in flames
W: and both of her children are in their beds crying
W: and she loves them both with the whole of her heart
W: but she knows she can only carry one at a time?
W: she's choking on the smoke of unthinkable choices
W: she is haunted by the voices of so many desires
W: she's bent over from the business of begging forgiveness
W: while frantically running around putting out fires
W: 
W: but then what kind of scale compares the weight of two beauties
W: the gravity of duties or the ground speed of joy?
W: tell me what kind of gauge can quantify elation?
W: what kind of equation could i possibly employ?
W: and you'll never know, dear just how much i loved you
W: you probably think this was just my big excuse
W: but i stand committed to a love that came before you
W: and the fact that i adore you is just one of my truths
W: 
W: so I, - i'm goin' home
W: to please the one i so love pleasing
W: and i don't expect
W: he'll have much sympathy for my grieving
W: but i guess that this is the price
W: that we pay for the privilege
W: of living for even a day
W: in a world with so many things
W: worth believing in

W: Down the street you can hear her scream you’re a disgrace
W: 
W: As she slams the door in his drunken face
W: 
W: And now he stands outside
W: 
W: And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool
W: 
W: He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
W: 
W: What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
W: 
W: Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
W: 
W: And his tears fall and burn the garden green
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand fall into the sea, eventually
W: 
W: A little indian brave who before he was ten,
W: 
W: Played wargames in the woods with his indian friends
W: 
W: And he built up a dream that when he grew up
W: 
W: He would be a fearless warrior indian cheif
W: 
W: Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
W: 
W: Tomorrow he would sing his first warsong and fight his first battle
W: 
W: But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that
W: night
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually
W: 
W: There was a young girl, whos heart was a frown
W: 
W: cause she was crippled for life,
W: 
W: And she couldn’t speak a sound
W: 
W: And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
W: 
W: So she decided to die
W: 
W: She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
W: 
W: And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
W: 
W: But then a sight shed never seen made her jump and say
W: 
W: Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
W: 
W: And it really didn’t have to stop, it just kept on going...
W: 
W: And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually

W: dove beneath my floating home
W: Down below my graceful side, In the turning tide
W: To watch the sea fish roam
W: 
W: There I heard a story
W: from the sailors of the Sandra Marie
W: There's another island a days' run away from here
W: And it’s empty and free
W: 
W: From here to Venezuela
W: nothing more than to see
W: Than a hundred thousand islands, flung like jewels upon the sea
W: For you and me

W: Sunset smells of dinner
W: Women are calling at me to end the tales
W: But perhaps I'll see you the next quiet place
W: I furl my sails

W: When you find strange hands in your sweater
W: 
W: When your dreamboat turns out to be a footnote

W: I'm a man with a mission in two or three editions
W: 
W: [Chorus:]
W: 
W: And I'm giving you a longing look
W: 
W: Everyday, everyday, everyday I write the book
W: 
W: Chapter One we didn't really get along
W: 
W: Chapter Two I think I fell in love with you
W: 
W: You said you'd stand by me in the middle of Chapter Three
W: 
W: But you were up to your old tricks in Chapters Four, Five and Six
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: 
W: The way you walk
W: 
W: The way you talk, and try to kiss me, and laugh
W: 
W: In four or five paragraphs
W: 
W: All your compliments and your cutting remarks
W: 
W: Are captured here in my quotation marks
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: 
W: Don't tell me you don't know the difference
W: 
W: Between a lover and a fighter
W: 
W: With my pen and my electric typewriter

W: 
W: I'd still own the film rights and be working on the sequel

W: To walk down the street with him
W: He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
W: And wears this white crash helmet
W: He has golden chains on his leather jacket
W: And on the back are written the names
W: 'Mary and Mom

W: 
W: I would gratefully appreciate it

W: But for all we know, we might still have a way to go
W: Before you go, there's something you ought to know
W: There's a guy in my block, he lives for rock
W: He plays records day and night
W: And when he feels down, he puts some rock 'n' roll on
W: And it makes him feel alright
W: And when he feels the world is closing in
W: He turns his stereo way up high
W: He just spends his life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy

W: The king is dead, rock is done
W: You might be through but I've just begun
W: I don't know, I feel free and I won't let go
W: Before you go, there's something you ought to know
W: Dan is a fan and he lives for our music
W: It's the only thing that gets him by
W: He's watched us grow and he's seen all our shows
W: He's seen us low and he's seen us high
W: Oh, but you and me keep thinking
W: That the world's just passing us by
W: Don't' want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy
W: Don't want to spend my life living on the edge of reality
W: Don't want to waste my life, hiding away anymore
W: Don't want to spend my life, living in a rock 'n' roll fantasy...

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Now I've heard there was a secret chord
W: That David played, and it pleased the Lord
W: But you dont really care for music, do you?
W: It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W: The minor falls, the major lifts
W: The baffled king composing Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Your faith was strong but you needed proof
W: You saw her bathing on the roof
W: Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
W: She tied you to a kitchen chair
W: She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
W: And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Well baby I've been here before
W: I know this room and I've walked this floor
W: You see I used to live alone before I knew ya
W: And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
W: But listen love, love is not some kind of victory march, no
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: 
W: There was a time you let me know
W: What's really going on below
W: But now you never show it to me, do you?
W: And I remember when I moved in you
W: And the holy dove she was moving too
W: And every single breath we drew was Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: Well, maybe there's a God above
W: As for me all I've ever learned from love
W: Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
W: But it's not a crime that you're hear tonight
W: It's not some pilgrim who claims to have seen the Light
W: No, it's a cold and it's a very broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

W: He feels like a princess

W: A woman's voice reminds me
W: To serve and not to speak

W: And work around my yellow stripe
W: Should I hide or eat my pride
W: Or wait until it's good and ripe?
W: My life is boiling over

V:1 
W: 
W: Some people say that life’s a game, well if this is so I’d like to
W: know
W: 
W: The rules of which this game of life is based
W: 
W: I know no game more fitting, than the age old game of cricket
W: 
W: It has honor, it has character, and it’s British
W: 
W: Now God laid down these rules of life when he wrote those ten
W: commandments
W: 
W: And to cricket those same ten rules shall apply
W: 
W: So show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all
W: 
W: and come to Gods call    with bat and ball
W: 
W: Now the devil has a player and he’s called the demon Bowler
W: 
W: He’s schrewd, he’s rude and he’s wicked
W: 
W: He’s sent by sinful Satan and he’s out to take your wicket
W: 
W: And you know that that’s not cricket
W: 
W: He’ll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and offspin
W: 
W: So keep a level head and don’t let that demon in
W: 
W: So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide
W: 
W: And you’ll get by,    yes you’ll get by
W: 
W: All through your life, he’ll try to bowl you out
W: 
W: Beware the demon Bowler
W: 
W: He’s crafty and deceitful and he’ll try to LBW
W: 
W: And bowl a maiden over
W: 
W: The devil takes the weak in spirit so we must always be courageous
W: 
W: And remember that God is on your side
W: 
W: So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line
W: 
W: And you’ll get by,    yes you’ll get by

W: 
W: Broke, busted, disgusted, agents can't be trusted

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Otto Titsling, inventor and kraut,
W: 
W: had nothing to get very worked up about.
W: 
W: His inventions were failures, his future seemed bleak.
W: 
W: He fled to the opera at least twice a week.
W: 
W: One night at the opera he saw an Aida
W: 
W: who's t-ts were so big they would often impede her.
W: 
W: Bug-eyed he watched her fall into the pit,
W: 
W: done in by the weight of those terrible t-ts.
W: 
W: Oh, my god! There she blows!
W: 
W: Aerodynamically this bitch was a mess.
W: 
W: Otto eyeballed the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds,
W: 
W: and he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration
W: 
W: flood his soul. He knew what he had to do!
W: 
W: He ran back to his workshop
W: 
W: where he futzed and futzed and futzed.
W: 
W: For Otto Titsling had found his quest:
W: 
W: to lift and mold the female breast;
W: 
W: to point the small ones to the sky;
W: 
W: to keep the big ones high and dry!
W: 
W: Every night he'd sweat and snort
W: 
W: searching for the right support.
W: 
W: He tried some string and paper clips.
W: 
W: Hey! He even tried his own two lips!
W: 
W: Well, he stitched and he slaved
W: 
W: and he slaved and he stitched
W: 
W: until finally one night, in the wee hours of morning,
W: 
W: Otto arose from his workbench triumphant.
W: 
W: Yes! He had invented the worlds first
W: 
W: over-the-shoulder-boulder-holder. Hooray!
W: 
W: Exhausted but ecstatic he ran
W: 
W: down the street to the diva's house
W: 
W: bearing the prototype in his hot little hand.
W: 
W: Now, the diva did not want to try the darn thing on.
W: 
W: But, after many initial misgivings,
W: 
W: she finally did.
W: 
W: And the sigh of relief that issued forth
W: 
W: from the diva's mouth
W: 
W: was so loud that it was mistaken by some
W: 
W: to be the early onset of the Siroccan Winds
W: 
W: which would often roll through the Schwarzwald
W: 
W: with a vengeance!
W: 
W: Ahhhhh-i!
W: 
W: But little did Otto know,
W: 
W: at the moment of his greatest triumph,
W: 
W: lurking under the diva's bed
W: 
W: was none other than the very worst
W: 
W: of the French patent thieves,
W: 
W: Philippe DeBrassiere.
W: 
W: And Phil was watching the scene
W: 
W: with a great deal of interest!
W: 
W: Later that night, while our Brun Hilda slept,
W: 
W: into the wardrobe Philippe softly crept.
W: 
W: He fumbled through knickers and corsets galore,
W: 
W: 'til he found Otto's titsling and he ran out the door.
W: 
W: Crying, "Oh, my god! What joy! What bliss!
W: 
W: I'm gonna make me a million from this!
W: 
W: Every woman in the world will wanna buy one.
W: 
W: I can have all the goods manufactured in Taiwan."
W: 
W: "Oh, thank you!"
W: 
W: The result of this swindle is pointedly clear:
W: 
W: Do you buy a titsling or do you buy a brassiere?

W: Thank you
W: For letting me stay here
W: Thank you for taking me in
W: Thank you
W: For the beer and the food
W: Thank you
W: For loaning me bus fare
W: Thank you for showing me around
W: That was a very kind thing to do
W: Thank you
W: For the use of the clean towel
W: Thank you for half of your bed
W: We can sleep here like brother and sister,
W: You said
W: But you changed the rules
W: In an hour or two
W: And I don't know what you
W: And your sisters do
W: But please don't
W: Please stop
W: This is not my obligation
W: What does my body have to do
W: With my gratitude?
W: Look at you
W: Little white lying
W: For the purpose of justifying
W: What you're trying to do
W: I know that you feel my resistance
W: I know that you heard what I said
W: Otherwise you wouldn't need the excuse
W: Thank you
W: For letting me stay here
W: Thank you for taking me in
W: I don't know where else
W: I would have turned
W: But I don't come and go
W: Like a pop song
W: That you can play incessantly
W: And then forget when it's gone
W: You can't write me off
W: And you don't turn me on
W: So don't change the rules
W: In an hour or two
W: I don't know what you and your
W: Sisters do
W: But please don't
W: Please stop
W: This is not my obligation
W: What does my body have to do
W: With my gratitude?

V:1 
W: Tom Waits
W: 
W: Well ya play that Tarantella
W: 
W: All the hounds they start to roar
W: 
W: And the boys all go to hell
W: 
W: Then the Cubans hit the floor
W: 
W: And they drive along the pipeline
W: 
W: They tango till they’re sore
W: 
W: They take apart their nightmares
W: 
W: And they leave them by the door
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: Let me fall out the window
W: 
W: With confetti in my hair
W: 
W: Deal out jacks or better
W: 
W: On a blanket by the stairs
W: 
W: I’ll tell you all my secrets
W: 
W: But I lie about my past
W: 
W: So send me off to bed forever more
W: 
W: Make sure they play my theme song
W: 
W: I guess daisies will have to do
W: 
W: Just get me to New Orleans
W: 
W: And paint shadows on the pews
W: 
W: Turn the spit on that pig
W: 
W: Kick the drum and let me down
W: 
W: Put my clarinet beneath your bed
W: 
W: Till I get back in town

W: Just sure she’s all in calico
W: 
W: And the colour of a doll
W: 
W: Wave the flag on Cadillac day
W: 
W: And a skillet on the wall
W: 
W: Cut me a switch or hold your breath
W: 
W: Till the sun goes down
W: 
W: Write my name on the hood
W: 
W: Send me off to another town

C:Bob Dylan
B: songs
M:4/4
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: Sixteen years  -
W: Sixteen banners united over the field
W: Where the good shepherd grieves
W: Desperate men, desperate women divided
W: Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves
W: 
W: Fortune calls
W: I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
W: Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
W: She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
W: On midsummer's eve, near the tower
W: 
W: The cold-blooded moon
W: The captain waits above the celebration
W: Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
W: Whose ebony face is beyond communication
W: The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
W: 
W: They shaved her head
W: She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
W: A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
W: I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
W: Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
W: 
W: I stumbled to my feet
W: I rode past destruction in the ditches
W: With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
W: Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
W: Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you
W: 
W: The palace of mirrors
W: Where dog soldiers are reflected
W: The endless road and the wailing of chimes
W: The empty rooms where her memory is protected
W: Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times
W: 
W: She wakes him up
W: Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking
W: Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
W: She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
W: He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks
W: 
W: Gentlemen, he said
W: I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
W: I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
W: But Eden is burning, either getting ready for elimination
W: Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
W: 
W: Peace will come
W: With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire
W: But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall
W: And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
W: Between the King and the Queen of Swords

W: You with the sad eyes
W: Don't be discouraged
W: Oh I realize
W: It's hard to take courage
W: In a world full of people
W: You can lose sight of it all
W: And the darkness inside you
W: Can make you feel so small
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: But I see your true colors
W: Shining through
W: I see your true colors
W: And that's why I love you

W: Because you know I'll be there

W: She sends me blue valentines
W: 
W: All the way from Philadelphia
W: 
W: To mark the anniversary
W: 
W: Of someone that I used to be
W: 
W: And it feels just like theres
W: 
W: A warrant out for my arrest
W: 
W: Got me checkin in my rearview mirror
W: 
W: And I'm always on the run
W: 
W: Thats why I changed my name
W: 
W: And I didn't think you'd ever find me here
W: 
W: To send me blue valentines
W: 
W: Like half forgotten dreams
W: 
W: Like a pebble in my shoe
W: 
W: As I walk these streets
W: 
W: And the ghost of your memory
W: 
W: Is the thistle in the kiss
W: 
W: And the burgler that can break a roses neck
W: 
W: It's the tatooed broken promise
W: 
W: That I hide beneath my sleeve
W: 
W: And I see you every time I turn my back
W: 
W: She sends me blue valentines
W: 
W: Though I try to remain at large
W: 
W: They're insisting that our love
W: 
W: Must have a eulogy
W: 
W: Why do I save all of this madness
W: 
W: In the nightstand drawer
W: 
W: There to haunt upon my shoulders
W: 
W: Baby I know
W: 
W: I'd be luckier to walk around everywhere I go
W: 
W: With a blind and broken heart
W: 
W: That sleeps beneath my lapel
W: 
W: She sends me my blue valentines
W: 
W: To remind me of my cardinal sin
W: 
W: I can never wash the guilt
W: 
W: Or get these bloodstains off my handa
W: 
W: And it takes a lot of whiskey
W: 
W: To take this nightmares go away
W: 
W: And I cut my bleedin heart out every nite
W: 
W: And I die a little more on each St. Valentines day
W: 
W: Remember that I promised I would
W: 
W: Write you...
W: 
W: These blue valentines
W: 
W: blue valentines
W:

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness,
W: Part this red river of pain.
W: 
W: I don't necessarily buy
W: Any key to the future or happiness
W: But I need a little place in the sun sometimes
W: Or I think I'll die.
W: 
W: And everywhere is somewhere but nowhere is near.
W: Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.
W: But I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: With an empty apartment and a best friend who is queer. Heh.
W: 
W: Every time I see him he smiles
W: And tells me how well he's walking these miles.
W: But he never ever asks a single thing about me.
W: If I died he'd hear about it eventually.
W: 
W: Diamonds, roses, I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness,
W: Part this red river of pain. Ohhh.
W: 
W: 'Cause everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near.
W: Everybody's got somebody with their wine and their beer.
W: And I'm a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: With my bills in the mailbox and some checks that won't clear...... this year.

W: So I'm just a tragic figure in the corner over here
W: Who'll sleep it off 'til morning and still not know that we're,
W: 
W: We're all just diamonds and roses. I need Moses
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.
W: To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain.

W: 
W: and know they love you.
W: 
W: And you, of tender years,
W: 
W: Can't know the fears that your elders grew by,
W: 
W: And so please help them with your youth,
W: 
W: They seek the truth before they can die.
W: 
W: Teach your parents well,

W: I could stay home every night
W: Wait around for Mr.Right
W: Take cold showers every day
W: And throw my life away
W: On a dream that won't come true
W: 
W: I could hurt someone like me
W: Out of spite or jealousy
W: I don't steal and I don't lie
W: But I can feel and I can cry
W: A fact I'll bet you never knew

W: 
W: We are the collectors of precious things
W: Of cute little vase and fake gold earrings
W: Of all things that glitters, dazzles and shines
W: Of half broken mugs in pretty designs
W: 
W: Of interesting books that I never read
W: Of decorative cushions for the top of the bed
W: We are the Salvos and Vinnies brigade
W: At their doors at nine and ready to trade
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: This need it's growing inside of me
W: I prefer to call it serendipity
W: It sounds like a positive description
W: For what really is a nasty addiction
W: 
W: I am the early bird at every garage sale
W: I am the rooter through boxes where bargains prevail
W: I try to temper this need of mine
W: I must learn to learn to tow the minimal line
W: 
W: Before this collecting spins out of control
W: And leaves me in a cluttery hole
W: With every useless knickknack and every stupid tray
W: I get a little less free to enjoy the day
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: From under piles of stuff I will wonder
W: One day I'll be six feet under
W: Who'll deal my this junk at the end of the day
W: That builds up in my life and takes my freedom away

W: I'm snoozy and whoozy and staying in bed

W: But with six cups of tea I'll recover just fine
W: 
W: The Meaning of Leif is the name of my Van
W: Leif was my Dad, he was a lively old man
W: Sadly he passed a few years ago
W: He left me a little bit of money and so

W: And I know Leif is watching from heaven above
W: 
W: So just as I slip away back to my dream
W: The arrival of the brain cell recovery team
W: A friend brings me pancakes through the caravan door
W: Just as I'm craving a pancake like never before
W: 
W: What blessing what joy to have such a friend
W: Who cooks breakfast to help me feel human again
W: Last night we got rowdy by the light of the moon
W: We stayed up all night singing tune after tune
W: 
W: Despite hangovers and headache it's a beautiful day
W: We love the freedom of getting away
W: Away from the phones and hustle of life
W: From work and the news of a world deep in strife

W: 
W: "Go away" he said "you're cramping my style"
W: It's a helluva way to ease me down

W:

W: It never felt right, like running down the highway
W: While wearing your shoes back to front
W: 
W: So I hold my head up high
W: It's just another stumble
W: Just another dent in my road
W: 
W: But the question still remains
W: After taking this tumble
W: Am I prepared to kiss another toad
W: 
W: So time to move on and forget about the hurt
W: It's not exactly the end of my world
W: To be dumped and discarded by a 1[st] class jerk
W: `Cos I'm no longer a timid little girl
W: 
W: No more wasting time on another dud lover
W: I would rather stick needles in my eyes
W: I'll hit the ground running and soon enough recover
W: I'll be dancing and reaching for the skies

W: 
W: Yippee - Thursday is here again and I'm excited as ever 	D / / /   	F# / / /
W: Song writing club is on, I want to write something really clever 	G / / /   	Bb / / /
W: I want to impress I want to excel and tonight our word is `city' 	D / / /  	F# / / /
W: Determined to outdo myself and come up with something witty  	G / / / 	Bb C
W: D / / /	D  / / /
W: At my desk committing hard to writing my first hit song
W: Waxing lyrical, concentration poised, then everything goes wrong	Repeat: Verse
W: 10 minutes in, my mojo goes and I can't write no more
W: The pool of my creative juice have spilt out on the floor
W: Chorus
W: No clever words or wit is forthcoming on the screen 	G / / / 	Gm / / /
W: No mega-hit song is in the making 	D / / / 	D7 / / /
W: It's looking like I'll never get to live my fucking dream 	G / / /	Gm / / /
W: But spend the rest of my days just faking 	A / G / 	Bm / / A
W: 
W: 4 Bars on D as intro
W: 
W: I ask myself: what can I do to get composing flowing
W: Perhaps a glass of red or two will really get things going
W: Before long I'm half sloshed and my brain cells are misfiring	Verse
W: Unfocused and distracted, but I'm really bloody trying
W: 
W: I need to tap this vault of brilliance; I have no doubt I possess
W: Well maybe not that brilliant, more mediocre I confess	Verse
W: But all the stories hidden in there, a lifetime of experience
W: Opening my soul to provide some good material
W: 
W: CHORUS	Chorus
W: 
W: So this song is just another failed song that didn't make it
W: But in the end I'm happy to say, that I didn't have to fake it	Verse
W: It may never get me on MTV, or launch me into a star
W: But it has grit and it has guts, so I'm glad I came this far
W: 
W: The words came forth from deep within the very core of me
W: A product of persistence & frustrated energy	Verse
W: It came so fast when it finally came and I was smiling as I wrote it
W: I better come back next week, with my shot at another smash hit
W: 
W: Some cleverness and wit did come forth on my screen
W: Perhaps a mega hit song for the taking 	Chorus
W: I maybe even get to live a little dream
W: Not spend the rest of my days just faking

W: Yet nothing resolves and I wonder whether
W: This night is ever gonna end?
W: 
W: Sleep is eluding me
W: I'm wide awake with every sound
W: I'd surely keel over
W: If I wasn't already lying down
W: 
W: And so as the sun comes up
W: I finally slip away
W: Desperate for rest before dawn
W: And another busy day

W: 
W: I'd like to stop for coffee but there'a is no time left for me

W: I'd like to stop the time for once and take a break instead
W: But life is for the living, can't expect a rosy bed
W: To get some rest and peace I'll have to wait till I am dead
W: It's fine to keep a clock that helps you be somewhere at 2
W: But if you don't watch out the clock will end up keeping you
W: 
W: At 6 o'clock the phone rings, in the midst of cooking dinner
W: A telemarketeering wanker tells me I'm a winner
W: `Miss LINGBIE" says a foreign voice, we have a special offer
W: I throw the phone against the wall, what bullshit I must suffer
W: 
W: My dog has rolled in something that stinks to highest heaven
W: So now she needs a bath before my banjo class at 7
W: Just as I think I've got it made and finally back on track
W: I'd rather stay at home with cuppa tea and hit the sack
W: 
W: But off I go with Banjo case and drive into the night
W: I have to speed like crazy just to get there before eight
W: My banjo class was cancelled, I was never notified
W: I waited for 2 hours and went home at half past 9
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: 
W: I finally arrive back home and sit down with a wine
W: But not before I get three loads of washing off the line
W: At last I make it to my bed, lie down by half past 12
W: I am a slave to clockwork and it's proving living hell

W: 
W: `Cos I've seen that look before
W: And felt those vibes
W: It doesn't take a genious
W: To spot the telltale signs
W: 
W: Smeared all over your clothes
W: And stuck to your face
W: The 40-second rule applies
W: 
W: You don't have to speak the words
W: We're in the same place
W: I see it in your eyes
W: 
W: `Cos I've seen that look before
W: And felt those vibes
W: It doesn't take a genious
W: To spot the telltale signs
W: 
W: There's no point in denying it
W: That we both know
W: what no one has yet spoken
W: 
W: The scene has already been set
W: Who will make the next move
W: Will the tension ever be broken
W: 
W: `Cos I've seen that look before
W: And felt those vibes
W: It doesn't take a genious
W: To spot the telltale signs
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: That's all it takes to sense a mutual attraction
W: My heartbeat is elevated and I go Red in the face
W: The ridiculous stumbling over words
W: that normally comes easy
W: And fumbling of hands and jerks in the body
W: What to say next
W: You wanna keep talking but afraid to sound too keen and
W: But it's a wasted excersise
W: Will there be a show of hands
W: I know what goes on

W: 
W: The sky is turning pinky blue
W: It's the end of another day
W: it slipped right through my fingers
W: while I was looking the other way
W: 
W: I watch the news of the world on TV
W: As I settle in each night
W: We've fallen asleep at the wheel again
W: And forgotten how to fight
W: 
W: There is a price to pay
W: For such willful ignorance
W: As we place our lives and answers
W: at the hands of the incompetent
W: 
W: We've taken far too much
W: And you can only reap what you sow
W: We must settle our debts
W: And pay back what we owe
W: 
W: The scores must be settled
W: The swords will fall
W: One way or the other
W: Or once and for all
W: 
W: Looking for hope
W: Looking for joy
W: Let's tell all the madmen
W: The world is not your toy
W: 
W: The bow is fully tensed
W: And waiting for release
W: The pointed arrow lies within
W: Threatening our peace
W: 
W: Something will give one day
W: whether we're ready or we're not
W: I only wish I knew the way
W: to somehow change the plot
W: 
W: I wish that I could find relief
W: From this constant sense of doom
W: I guess none of us are innocent
W: Not one here in the room
W: 
W: Is there time to turn the worm
W: And take back what it ate
W: starve this hungry creature
W: Or is it already too late

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND                 By the fantabulous Deb Morgan
W: 
W: (Short off the cuff, spoken only...not read due to spelling of a certain word)
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND 1
W: 
W: High on the headland..an eagle sawed.............
W: ......a piece of 4 by two into small pieces so they could be
W: used to make a fire to keep its eaglets warm.
W: 
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND 2
W: 
W: High on the headland
W: I got high when I saw the sky
W: I then got low when I kicked my toe
W: And this started to throb so I drank some grog
W: And this did the trick but then I got sick
W: So I smoke some pot and I ate a lot
W: But that was ok because it was a craving eh?.....not a Craven A
W: High on a headland
W: I saw the sea winking at me
W: And I thought
W: No more weed for me
W: Except
W: I weed my pants
W: and  that was by chance
W: Cause I missed the loo
W: And am relieved it wasn't poo
W: Height isnt everything
W: But being really high
W: Has its benefits
W: I can touch the sky
W: 
W: HIGH ON THE HEADLAND                                      By Matthew Perry
W: 
W: Climbing high on the headland I remove my shoes...Then off with the socks...Toeland is revealed in all its glory, a thriving exuberant colony of freshly freed wiggling digits.
W: The nearby Footlands exist in relative harmony with their neighbor, Ankleland. A quiet vegetarian nation who nervously share a border with Calveland a place known for its flagrant disregard for animal rights in the wake of its booming veal industry.
W: Further up the Tibia Trail, Kneeland protrudes, a place known for over extending itself to the point of bankruptcy often requiring a full replacement.
W: Nearby Thighland, a very popular destination for Australian tourists which unfortunately is often linked to the notorious Crotchland. I move right along skirting notorious areas to avoid irritating certain crochety inhabitants.
W: Naval Land awaits, known to be home to mysterious covert actions and murky joint operations. Discouraged by somewhat aggressive signage... Danger Keep out! Live Ammunition! We make very very loud bangs! I  leave in search of more welcoming terrains.
W: I gladly clamber over the tiny republic of Sternumland and push on into the broad corrugations of Ribland the keepers of the Giant Chest.
W: I stop to take a breath as Neckland emerges from the clouds above. I take it on the Chinland and with not a Sherpa in sight I drag myself up the North Face. After regaining my breath I traverse the deep furrows of Browland and find my self in the legendary Follicle Forests of Scalpland. After a few hairy moments I stumble into a bald patch...And there to my amazement I find myself back...High on the Headland... It's a perfect day... Crystal clear with perfect 360 degree déjà vus!!!
W: 
W: Oh Fuck... Where did I leave my shoes???
W: 
W: High on the Headland                                        By Fiona Cullen
W: Bathed in it shimmering silvery light the water sparkles like a welcoming path from the island
W: Ancient rocky outcrops stand as sentinels protecting this grassy knoll
W: The ocean is like a giant lung breathing in and out in and out
W: My rock pools to the south my very special place of freedom, love and laughter where my spirit can soar
W: High on the headland encompass magnificent surrounds
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: Headland                                 By David Harris
W: High on the headland: not for the faint-hearted!
W: Nor my isthmus neck
W: Holding my level gaze, feet splayed
W: Eyes azimuth bound
W: Positioning a lonely star: no-mans-land is hope!
W: Step in which direction?
W: Oh strings of zenith, dance my feet tip-toe dizzy
W: Then snip me free-fall
W: Where isthmus and headland are one step away.

W: I dream high on the headland of Mystery Bay
W: 
W: We live, we breathe

W: At the end of the day

W: 
W: High on the headland of the Dulwich Hill platform, we wait for the next train.
W: How long do I have to be out in the late night air on the cold headland?
W: The young Islander boys passing by are in high spirits.
W: 
W: The clock ticks over in that electronic way.
W: And the fluro lights buzz,
W: With that noise they make.
W: Or is it my tinnitus?
W: 
W: It's said the Lyrids meteor shower will be the celestial attraction tonight.
W: I'd like to see a meteor shower.
W: I've tried many times to see one but no success.
W: Can I stay up that late?
W: Surely, it's past my bedtime.
W: 
W: The claxon says "The next train to arrive goes to City Circle".
W: No that's the wrong way.
W: Give me the Belmore train and take me off this headland high.
W: 
W: Now our train comes, and the Islander boys get on the train too,
W: And sing four-part harmony with mouth percussion.
W: Is This Love - The Lion Sleeps Tonight - Lean On Me - Stand By Me.
W: Way cool.
W: They are very good.
W: 
W: I could be high on a headland where the bay is a mystery.
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: High On The Headland                  By Andrew Kordas
W: 
W: High on the headland the mystery of the bay
W: Reveal the clues of that hapless day
W: 
W: If there up high the view was plain to see?
W: But the observer's perspective can be obscured
W: Herein the events are now disclosed
W: The bay was calm and into the sea the crew was lured
W: 
W: Unbeknownst to them unclad
W: That dip was their last to be had
W: A rip came through and out they were dragged
W: They struggled and flailed,
W: efforts flaunted and failed
W: 
W: Chances diminished as a dorsal arrived
W: But not one nor two, a dozen more
W: Hard to tell but those large slippery forms encircled them
W: The crystal-clear aqueous azure
W: Gave way to a frenzied claret
W: All were sacrificed in a gluttonous feast
W: Devoured by the gnashing of those underwater beasts
W: Not a skerrick of their anatomy was spared as evidence
W: To tell the tale of their sordid providence.
W: 
W: HARRY'S  TALE                                                                            By Anne Burrell
W: 
W: Disclaimer:  Any similarity to any Harry real or imagined, true or untrue, hairy or otherwise is purely coincidental. The story and characters are completely and absolutely fictional and I believe only the subject of camp myth and legend.
W: 
W: Hairy Harry stood high on the headland
W: His head stood higher still
W: But his heart was heavy and sad now
W: As he pondered on what he just did
W: 
W: For he woke in the camp after midnight
W: Thirst and hunger disturbing his sleep
W: He went through all he had with him
W: But his hunger and thirst did persist
W: 
W: He drank everything he could find in camp
W: And ate till he'd eaten his fill
W: Now nothing remained for the campers
W: And things looked decidedly grim
W: 
W: He was sure to be shunned and expelled now
W: By all fellow campers and friends
W: For the transgression was certainly major
W: The worst there had ever been
W: 
W: They wouldn't be pleased or forgiving
W: When they woke and discovered the deed
W: No telling what steps would be taken
W: When hunger and thirst settled in
W: 
W: But he knew it wouldn't be pretty
W: So, he left the high headland `post haste'
W: He left the camp `hell for leather'
W: And we haven't seen him since

W: 
W: It's late one evening I'm getting ready for bed
W: When my friend calls me up and this is what she said
W: Her daughter's gone missing in the city without a trace
W: It's been 2 whole days since anyone saw her face
W: 
W: Your blood curdles and your gut sinks to the ground
W: All of a sudden you can't hear a sound
W: How does one cope with such desperation?
W: Or prepare you for this unthinkable situation
W: 
W: And she waits and she waits and she waits for a call
W: For just a sign or a clue or for anything at all
W: That can point the search onto the right track
W: And all she wants is her baby back
W: 
W: The future has never been ours to see
W: But it's different this time as the uncertainty
W: Is causing her head to explode
W: Her whole life about to erode
W: 
W: What will the future bring?
W: What will the future bring?
W: You would give anything
W: To know

W: 
W: There's something very weird - happening right here
W: Lately I've been hearing a strange whisper in my ear
W: Sometimes my left  - sometimes my right
W: I hear that whisper in the middle of the night
W: I try ignoring it -  but it's all in vain
W: Am I slowly going insane?
W: 
W: And just as I thought I've re-claimed my sleep
W: A friend of mine is selling his old banjo really cheap
W: He thinks that I - have the time
W: To learn another instrument of mine
W: I fear my man - will confiscate it
W: Just about to make my life complicated
W: 
W: But I must learn the banjo insists the little voice
W: I need that like a hole in the head but it seems I have no choice
W: No matter how much - I am resisting
W: The whisper just keeps on insisting
W: Has anybody -  seen my mind?
W: Have I lost it or left it behind
W: 
W: Cos here I am,  - Learning to play
W: Doing battle with this banjo every day
W: I never thought  -  I'd be seen dead
W: I must have a hole in my head

W: 
W: We met on the train, it was the Central Line
W: And fate put us together for just a moment in time
W: When the train came to a halt too quick
W: And an old man toppled over with his walking stick
W: 
W: We both rushed over to help him on his feet
W: When our heads banged together, well that's one way to meet
W: As we helped the old man up, you smiled at me
W: And I knew I liked you instantly
W: 
W: But the next stop was yours and as you walked out the door
W: I watched you move away into the rain
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: I just met you then you were gone
W: And I didn't even catch your name
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: It's such a shame
W: If only we'd had one more stop
W: I could have asked your name
W: 
W: Perhaps I'll go back and ride on that train
W: Hoping for the chance to meet you again
W: From the same place at the same time
W: Thinking you might be travelling that line
W: 
W: I only got to know you for 3 stops
W: Now I wanna know you for 3 more
W: I should have held you there a little longer
W: I should have come on a little stronger
W: 
W: But the next stop was yours and you walked out the door
W: And in the end there's no one else to blame
W: 
W: It's such a shame
W: I just met you then you were gone
W: And I didn't even catch your name

W: 
W: There are hundreds of people milling round this place
W: I am waiting at the station, scanning for your face
W: A face so familiar, cemented to my past
W: I'm excited and I'm nervous to meet with you at last
W: You told me you'd look older, you warned me you've gone grey
W: From the battles you've been fighting each and every day
W: But as time gose by, it no longer matters
W: We both carry the scars from the many dreams that shattered
W: 
W: I'm waiting for Christina
W: To come into my view
W: Looking for Christina
W: This one's for you
W: 
W: Thought I ran away, moving around the world
W: Inside I am still the scared little girl
W: And you stayed home, but this much is true
W: Underneath I am still me, and you are still you
W: And so here we are meeting in this place
W: And I can't wait to see that cheeky smile upon your face
W: And to talk and to laugh like the good old crazy days
W: When we used to have such fun in so many crazy ways
W: 
W: I'm waiting for Christina
W: To come into my view
W: Looking for Christina
W: This one's for you
W: 
W: Many years have gone by, I know it's been too long
W: And I regret the lost time and some things I did wrong
W: So, thank you for seeing me, now that I am back in town
W: And I do apologise if I ever let you down
W: But I cant' stay long, I must be on my way
W: There are so many things that I'd still like to say
W: And although too soon we must part again
W: I want you to know that I'll always be your friend
W: 
W: I'm waiting for Christina
W: To come into my view
W: Looking for Christina
W: This one's for you

W: 
W: You don't move around
W: with your usual swagger
W: You're on your sharp edge today
W: Your words hits me like a dagger
W: Can you please explain
W: Why in this state of suspense
W: You're fishing for a fight
W: So damn prickly and tense
W: 
W: It's not ok
W: to behave this way
W: Picking on everything and everyone
W: Just because you've had a bad day
W: 
W: You spit out the words
W: Like they are a foul taste in your mouth
W: Every venomous sentence
W: Sends my stomach reeling south
W: With every gentle approach
W: You snap at me like an angry pit bull
W: But that's not ok with me
W: My garbage bag is already full
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: Like a poison cloud, you spread the tension around the room
W: Like a poison cloud, there's nothing left but doom & gloom
W: Like a poison cloud, a toxic fallout raining down
W: Like a poison cloud, devastation spilling all around
W: 
W: What the hell is your problem
W: What's the source of all this tension
W: Whatever it is
W: Don't take it out on me
W: There is no need for that
W: I'm not prepared to wear it
W: There's no need to treat me
W: Like the enemy
W: 
W: It's not ok
W: to behave this way
W: Picking on everything and everyone
W: Just because you've had a bad day
W: 
W: You won't tell me what's wrong
W: Am I supposed to read your mind
W: Or figure out for myself
W: Why you are being so unkind
W: No point in hanging around
W: I don't like this atmosphere
W: And I wont loose my ground
W: I'm gonna get myself out of here

W: We've gone out for dinner
W: Oh yum yum I'm having the duck
W: Yum for my tum
W: But it's just my luck
W: That a bit of duck
W: gets stuck
W: Stuck between my teeth
W: so I suck, and I suck
W: But no matter how hard I suck
W: Bits of bloody duck
W: is still stuck
W: And I think;
W: "oh fuck, - that sucks"
W: So I ask for a pick,
W: you know; a little stick
W: To pluck between your buck teeth
W: So now I pick
W: And I pluck
W: Just a little prick with a stick
W: And I lick, and I suck,
W: but the duck's still stuck
W: In there with all the other muck
W: That I had for breakfast, lunch & picnic
W: And it's making me sick
W: I feel like a lunatic
W: It's like a truck load of yuck is stuck
W: So I surely I shall chuck
W: `Cos now the damn stick is stuck
W: With the duck and the muck
W: Just my bloody luck
W: And it's not funny so don't ducking chuckle at me
W: Or I'll do this trick,
W: where I use the picking stick to flick
W: The duck and the muck at you, you smug dick
W: But if you're quick
W: You can duck and avoid the stick, duck & muck
W: You schmuck!!!!!!!!

W: with his tail between his legs
W: I should have seen this moment coming before you
W: left me here with the dregs
W: 
W: Now I know that I'm not a fool

W: I'm going under
W: And I'm desperately struggling to breathe

W: Like a bolt of lightening out of the blue you,
W: crashed into my heart
W: I could never have counted on you
W: I could have known that right from the start
W: 
W: Now I know that I'm not a fool
W: And you warned me not to get too excited
W: But you don't always play by the rules
W: And so my love must remain unrequited

W: 
W: I got myself out in the desert at last
W: Where my mind can rest easy in a landscape so vast
W: I'm loving the empty, I'm loving the void
W: I can finally quit feeling paranoid
W: 
W: To sit on a rock and just meditate
W: And take all my time just to contemplate
W: Feeling my head, Feeling my arms
W: Feeling my legs, or just feeling for once
W: 
W: All the empty
W: Empty and free
W: I am empty
W: Empty and free
W: 
W: I lie flat on the ground as I gaze at a star
W: And feel just how small and unimportant we are
W: Breathing in awe, finding respect
W: Learning to center and to reconnect
W: 
W: This void is my guide to finding my place
W: It's plain as the wind and the open space
W: It's plain as the gravel that slips through my fingers
W: I think of all and nothing and as the peace lingers
W: 
W: In the empty
W: Empty and free
W: I am empty
W: Empty and free
W: 
W: Relaxing my body and give up the fight
W: I gravitate towards all the stars in the night
W: Vacating my mind and let go of my thinking
W: I hover above and watch my body sinking
W: 
W: Into empty
W: Empty and free
W: I am empty
W: Empty and free

W: 
W: It's that magic time of year and I'm packing up my van
W: I'm trying to get out of here, with guitar in my hand
W: I'm going up the mountain with butterflies inside
W: Heading for that barren hillside underneath the powerlines
W: 
W: I'm hoping to get there before noon
W: But I have work to do, I can't just up and go
W: But my friend said: please get here soon
W: So we can meet under the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: It's stinking hot and sunny and I need a swim to cool
W: I wander down that snakey track and jump into the pool
W: It's ok to be lazy for a change I confess
W: To slow down and smell the roses, feel connected and so blessed
W: 
W: So I'm trying to get there before noon
W: But I have work to do, I can't just up and leave
W: But my friend said: please get here soon
W: So we can swim under the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: Morning, noon or night, I don't care, it's all the same
W: I'm always poised and ready for a Scrabble game
W: Someone, you know who you are, has spike my cuppa tea
W: But It's warm and it's good and I detect a hint of whiskey
W: 
W: I'm hoping to get there before noon
W: But I have work to do, I can't just up and go
W: But my pal said: please get here soon
W: We'll Scrabble underneath the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: But as the afternoon approach, a storm in closing in
W: And for an hour we get hammered by the rain and by the wind
W: But what's a little weather when all your friends are here
W: We cosy under every tarp and share the rainy atmosphere
W: 
W: I'm trying to get there at noon
W: But I have work to do, I can't just up and go
W: But my friend said: please get here soon
W: So we can play under the Numerella Moon
W: 
W: But somehow those powerlines they vitalise and energise
W: We like to think they add a spark to help us socialise
W: Cos sitting round the campfire with all my friends just playing
W: There's a magic going on that no one can explain
W: 
W: So I'll definitely get there by noon
W: And I've done my work it's time for me to go
W: And my mate said: please get here soon
W: So we can sing under the Numerella Moon
W: So lets all sing under the Numerella Moon

W: The Tudor Court Hotel                 Charlotte Lyngbye 15 February 2018
W: 
W: # intro
W: 
W: # verse
W: I left my home in Denmark when I was just eighteen
W: Went off to work in London as an aupair  - what was I thinking
W: With guitar in hand and army jacket I arrived in Golders Green
W: To a suburban Jewish family, both orthodox and mean
W: So being me and a bit of a rebel, that didn't work out too well
W: But thankfully I scored a new job
W: At The [Tudor Court Hotel]
W: 
W: # verse
W: This run down backpackers in the heart of Paddington
W: A 5 storey terrace with polyester sheets in every room
W: I worked in the reception and as a chambermaid
W: I lived in on the premises as well as getting paid
W: The young folks there were friendly, and we'd party till we fell
W: And I sowed a bunch of wild oats
W: At The [Tudor Court Hotel]
W: 
W: # verse
W: When Rob, a tall dark stranger, who came all the way from Broome
W: We danced and held hands 5 flights upstairs to his room
W: He was leaving the next day so it was never meant to be
W: Years later he was in a Caltex advertising on TV
W: I'm glad to see Rob has a job, and that he still looks so well
W: But I still recall that night on the 5[th] floor
W: Of The [Tudor Court Hotel]
W: 
W: # verse
W: But the good times wouldn't last, and trouble was ahead
W: When they hired a new manager to run the Tudor Court instead
W: His name was Elvis, I kid you not, he smelt and he was greek
W: Nothing wrong with being greek as long as you don't reek
W: His hands were often sweaty and he was creepy as all hell
W: So bolted for the door and I quit my job
W: at The [Tudor Court Hotel]
W: 
W: # verse
W: But a girl I worked with, Catherine, she was an English rose
W: Later on we spent some girl time travelling the globe
W: We visited her handsome cousin who lived in the ACT
W: Then yada yada yada and the rest is history
W: So that's the story of how I got here, there's probably more to tell
W: But it all started when I rang the door bell
W: at The [Tudor Court Hotel]
W: 
W: # outro
W: [la la la .....]

W: Incredibly Crepuscular Creature       CLyngbye 5/6/17
W: 
W: My friend Rodgar, is a fun and clever man
W: And if you ever met him I know you'd understand
W: He's really good to talk to, he never is a bore
W: He leaves you weak and begging, always wanting more
W: 
W: You can never get enough of him,  he always has to run
W: Can never tie him down past the setting of the sun
W: Despite his disappearing you know he is your friend
W: And you learn to be patient till you catch him out again
W: 
W: He's a most incredibly crepuscular creature
W: Leaving on a high note, his most prominent feature
W: Best before sunset and just on twilight
W: His intriguing conversation engages and delights
W: 
W: He's a most incredibly crepuscular creature
W: Leaving on a high note, his most prominent feature
W: In the middle of a great conversation
W: He'll slip out the back and leave you in frustration

W: 
W: # verse
W: I've come out into the wild with a group of my friends
W: It's time to re-connect with Mother Nature again
W: It's windy and dusty and the mosquitos are biting
W: Goannas underfoot and the kangaroos are fighting
W: 
W: We gather together every afternoon
W: It's time for a snack and refreshment and soon
W: The tables are crammed with biscuits and dip
W: With cheeses and colourful drinks to sip
W: 
W: # chorus
W: [So what is your poison I ask you my friend
W: A Margarita, a or a triple Whiskey Sour again
W: Pina Colada, a Cosmo, Aperitivo or Manhattan]
W: Cos' these pretzels are making me thirsty
W: 
W: # verse
W: A handful of Doritos goes right down my hatch
W: A grasshopper suddenly awaits in my glass
W: I drink it down in one gulp and I show it no mercy
W: `Cos dammit these cheesy corn chips are making me thirsty
W: 
W: Now I'm staring in awe at a bright Blue lagoon
W: It's looking to become a wild afternoon
W: The next thing it's gone I have sculled the whole lot
W: I'm well on my way to loosing the plot
W: 
W: # chorus 
W: 
W: # verse
W: I can't resist these drinks so colourful and bright
W: That cheer up my day and match my fairy light
W: Too easy to drink like it's mothers milk
W: I'm feeling like singing, my voice as smooth as silk
W: 
W: Bloody Mary quite contrary how does your garden grow
W: With beer nuts and tequila but I'll have you know
W: That if I have one more strawberry daiquiri
W: I'll be comatose and ready for the knackery
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: # verse
W: But these friends can no longer be friends of mine
W: Leading me astray till I neglect to tow the line
W: I know there is a price to pay for having such fun
W: But who cares............................?
W: These pretzels are making me thirsty

W: 
W: Oh it's been so long since my world stood still,
W: Since I could hear myself breathe
W: Life seem to get increasingly complicated
W: I'm sweating and my heartbeat's accelerated
W: It's a cross that I bear
W: 
W: I don't' pretend to be a laid back kinda person
W: This is not the time or the place to be rehearsing
W: This is the real show
W: 
W: I'm in a frantic frenzy, suspended in mid-air
W: Wide awake, got the shakes
W: Can't put on the parking brakes,
W: It's the cross that I bear
W: 
W: All my friends advise me to meditate
W: But it's so much faster to just medicate
W: Just to let things go
W: 
W: But I'm supercharged and scatter brained, feeling insane
W: I can hardly remember my own name
W: I'ts a real damn shame
W: 
W: I'm frankly in a frenzy, suspended in mid-air
W: Wide awake, got the shakes
W: Can't put on the parking brakes,
W: It's the cross that I bear
W: 
W: There's no rest for the wicked or a restless soul like me
W: I'm putting out fires, I just can't let them be
W: But the show must go on
W: 
W: Unable to escape this panic mode
W: Looking for the answers but I'm ready to explode
W: I'm in a frenzy
W: 
W: I,m in a frantic frenzy, suspended in mid-air
W: Wide awake, got the shakes
W: Can't put on the parking brakes,
W: It's the cross that I must bear

W: # verse
W: It's like a strange presence, an alarm in the air
W: Unseen and unspoken, it does not declare
W: [So slowly, it creeps up your spine
W: Sneaks up on you, and approach from behind]
W: 
W: I can feel my blood freeze, and my stomach curdle
W: It takes all I have, to climb over this hurdle
W: [It gropes my back, like the hand of an unwelcome stranger
W: The hair on my neck stands on end as I sense the danger]
W:

W: Run from this evil within
W: Please [give me the strength to stand up face off my sin]

W: So am I deluded, is that my new deal
W: Or is it just my imagination that makes it so real
W: [The band is playing danger music inside my head
W: There's the smell of foreboding and the sinister feeling of dread]
W: 
W: I am uncertain, of what it is I am fighting
W: I'm like a sitting duck, just waiting for hell fire igniting
W: [Why am I being saddled, with all this anguish
W: I'm invaded by angry demons that I now must vanquish]

W: Everything Has To Be Goat Blues                Charlotte Lyngbye - 28 October 2015
W: 
W: I used to drink milk from a cow, when having my cuppa tea
W: And a nice hunk of lamb in a curry, well, that was just the ticket for me
W: But the latest trend in food and drink just doesn't float my boat
W: Cos Ladies & Gentleman these days, everything has to be GOAT
W: 
W: Whenever I go to a restaurant and order my big salad
W: They all contain this GOATS cheese, it does nothing for my palate
W: I'm looking at the menu while I'm waiting at my table
W: It may be the latest rave but it just tastes like a goat stable
W: 
W: Don't know `bout you, but the last time I checked a GOAT didn't smell too well
W: And now they expect me to devour it, am I in heaven or hell
W: We must adapt and change, to keep up with the latest fashion
W: This year it's GOAT but however it comes I just can't feel the passion
W: 
W: A moustache was the thing to sport if you were a bloke inthe 70ies
W: The distinguished handlebars was the facial hair of the roaring 20ies
W: But all of a sudden a man is not cool unless he has a GOATIE
W: A tuft of bristle on the chin, to keep the wind off his throatie
W: 
W: In the bathroom I used to keep Imperial Lather on a rope
W: Or Lux or Dove it didn't matter as long as it was soap
W: My daily power shower left my skin as smooth as silk
W: But oh no don't use that again, only organic soap with GOATs milk
W: 
W: Don't know `bout you, but the last time I checked a GOAT didn't smell too well
W: And now they expect me to devour it, am I in heaven or hell
W: We must adapt and change, to keep up with the latest fashion
W: This year it's GOAT but however it comes I just can't feel the passion

W: 
W: You say you ain't got none,  - well think again
W: And pinch yourself hard  - until you feel the pain
W: You're so damn lucky,
W: To even have a roof over your head,
W: So let's not forget - to have some respect
W: For all of those less fortunate
W: 
W: You always complain  - that you are tight
W: I wish you'd shut up about being broke
W: While you lunch out every day
W: And sip your $5 latte
W: You shouldn't joke
W: And compare yourself to the poor folk
W: Cos' all your money's gone up in smoke
W: 
W: We crave it, and earn it,
W: We save it, then burn it
W: We're so obsessed
W: With those little bits of paper with noughts on it
W: It can drive you crazy and surely ruin everything
W: When you think you - deserve to live like a king
W: Just in case you are wondering
W: 
W: You can buy a brand new car, - a new coffee table
W: And artwork that matches your couch
W: Another guitar
W: Or an electric tie carousel
W: A new boat and a flat screen
W: New Gucci loafers as well
W: On your road to consumer hell

W: Frank Mills Again                            Charlotte Lyngbye 12/5/16
W: 
W: After that day in the park in 1969
W: I didn't see Frank Mills again for many years
W: I used to love him so much and I still dream of him from time to time
W: He's always summed up all my joys and all my fears
W: 
W: He used to make my little teenage heart skip such a giant beat
W: And I often wonder would he even remember me
W: He looked so cool and breezy as he swayed and swaggered down the street
W: He had a way of making life look so easy
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: I loved him - and in a strange way I still do
W: I loved him  -  oh Frank Mills where are you
W: I loved him  -  he still lives inside of me
W: I loved him - my unspoilt fantasy
W: 
W: I've been wondering where he went and what's become of him
W: Is his leather jacket still his favourite thing to wear
W: I used to get so high just to walking along beside him
W: And losing him was nearly more that I could bear
W: 
W: But life has a way of answering all your questions
W: When last June I saw him walking in the Park
W: And he said "Hey babes" I think we still have a spark
W: The years were showing but he's eyes still had that spark
W: 
W: CHORUS:
W: I loved him - and I know that I still do
W: I loved him  -  oh Frank Mills it's really you
W: I love him  -  and he still remembers me
W: I love him  -  Let him never set me free

W: Underground                   Charlotte Lyngbye  -    7 september 2017
W: 
W: # verse
W: As I returned to my town of youth
W: Everywhere cranes, hoarding and equipment
W: They're digging in the parks, they're digging up the earth
W: Digging up the roads in the city up my birth
W: And the noise is deafening
W: They're going underground
W: 
W: # verse
W: And just like a wild fire
W: The ugliness is spreading
W: Out with the old, in with the new
W: A nasty rash on the face of my hometown
W: Just to get under the surface
W: And travel underground
W: 
W: # bridge
W: I loathe this godless tunneled space
W: That exists deep under the bitumen
W: This claustrophobic beast will haunt me
W: As soon as i descend down the escalators
W: And tightens it's grip on my throat
W: As I move down
W: I can hardly breathe
W: As I'm going underground
W: 
W: # verse
W: I want a view from my bus and my train
W: I value my sense of direction
W: Please don't ask me to cram together
W: With these strangers in these gloomy tunnels
W: Beneath the city
W: While moving underground
W: 
W: # verse
W: Thank heavens for my bike
W: That's still my favorite way to get around town
W: I need to feel the changing of the weather
W: And watch all the real life stories
W: Playing out on every street
W: I tell ya, I'm not going underground
W: I'm not going underground
W: I'm not going underground

W: What if it it keeps me on my feet
W: I'm allowed to fantasise
W: About your gorgeousness and your big brown eyes
W: 
W: But back here on earth where I mostly reside
W: I work in the office from nine until five
W: And wonder why must I be stuck in this place
W: I'd rather steal glimpses at your smiling face

W: 
W: # verse
W: I'm tired of trying to guess
W: your meaning,
W: when you skirt around the edge
W: of every conversation
W: The mystery of you
W: is wearing a bit thin
W: It doesn't make you special
W: It just boring and tedious
W: 
W: # chorus
W: [Give me something concrete
W: Give me solid ground to stay
W: Not a door out to the back street
W: Or grounds to walk away
W: Give me something concrete
W: You're all lipstick and no kiss
W: It's not that complicated
W: Just Say it like it is]
W: 
W: # verse
W: All this whishy washy
W: All the airy fairy, pie in the sky
W: What are you really saying?
W: Or rather not saying
W: You squirm and speak in tongues
W: What are you're so afraid of
W: Do you think I'll look down on you
W: If you just be you
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: # verse
W: For once just be straight with me
W: I've no patience for your riddles
W: Can't you just come out and say
W: What you need to say
W: Learn to call a spade a spade
W: Quit the secret games you play
W: Give up the charade
W: Which is just "your way"

W: # verse
W: It's Sunday, it's morning I wake from my sleep
W: I'm lethargic and lazy from the hours I keep
W: We're camped in the bush by the sea and the sand
W: The Meaning of Leif that's the name of my Van
W: 
W: I'm snoozy and I'm whoozy and staying in bed
W: Cos there's a man with a hammer inside of my head
W: He's telling me last night I drank too much wine
W: But with six cups of tea I'll recover just fine
W: 
W: # chorus
W: [The Meaning of Leif is the name of my Van]
W: Leif was my Dad, he was a lively old man
W: [Sadly he passed a few years ago]
W: He left me a little bit of money and so
W: [I spent it to buy this old Van that I love
W: And I know Leif is watching from heaven above]
W: 
W: # verse
W: So just as I slip away back to my dream
W: The arrival of the brain cell recovery team
W: A friend brings me pancakes through the caravan door
W: Just as I'm craving a pancake like never before
W: 
W: What blessing what joy to have such a friend
W: Who cooks breakfast to help me feel human again
W: Last night we got rowdy by the light of the moon
W: We stayed up all night singing tune after tune
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: # verse
W: Despite hangovers and headaches it's a beautiful day
W: We love the freedom of getting away
W: Away from the phones and hustle of life
W: From work and the news of a world deep in strife
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: I spent it to buy this old van that I love
W: And I know he is watching from heaven above

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One, two, three, four
W: Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
W: 'Cause falling in love just makes me blue
W: Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
W: I had a beer and now I hear you calling out for me
W: And I hope that I don't fall in love with you
W: 
W: Well, the room is crowded, people everywhere
W: And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
W: Well, if you sit down with this old clown, take that frown and break it
W: Before the evening's gone away, I think that we could make it
W: And I hope that I don't fall in love with you
W: 
W: Well, the night does funny things inside a man
W: These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
W: Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
W: I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
W: And I hope that I don't fall in love with you
W: 
W: I can see that you are lonesome just like me
W: And it being late, you'd like some company
W: Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
W: The guy you're with, he's up and split, the chair next to you's free
W: And I hope that you don't fall in love with me
W: 
W: Now it's closing time, the music's fading out
W: Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
W: Well, I turn around to look at you, you're nowhere to be found
W: I search the place for your lost face, guess I'll have another round
W: And I think that I just fell in love with you

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I don't know if you can see
W: The changes that have come over me
W: In these last few days I've been afraid
W: That I might drift away
W: 
W: So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
W: That make me think about where I came from
W: And that's the reason why I seem
W: So far away today
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Oh and I have moved and I've kept on moving
W: Proved the points that I needed proving
W: Lost the friends that I needed losing
W: Found others on the way
W: 
W: Oh and I have tried and kept on trying
W: Stolen dreams yes there's no denying
W: I have traveled far with conscience flying
W: Somewhere with the wind
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Now I'm sitting here before the fire
W: The empty room, the forest choir
W: The flames that could not get any higher
W: They've withered now they've gone
W: 
W: But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
W: And I know what I will do tomorrow
W: When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow
W: Then I will disappear
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything

W: I never heard it said
W: That kids can't fall in love and feel the same
W: I can still remember the first time I told you I loved you
W: 
W: On a dusty mid July
W: Country summer's evenin'
W: A weepin' willow sang its lullabies
W: And shared its secrets

W: Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests
W: Silver winged they fly, they know the call of freedom in their breasts
W: Soar Black Head against the sky
W: Between the rocks that run down to the sea
W: 
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
W: Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
W: 
W: Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
W: Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
W: 
W: Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
W: Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: 
W: Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
W: Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
W: Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: 
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: There is a place I know way down in Mexico
W: High in the old Sierra Madre
W: Where many an outlaw band from across the Rio Grande
W: Have found a haven, a holdout, a hideaway
W: 
W: But danger rides with those who stray upon their secret hideaway
W: Where death is sure to welcome anyone within the law
W: But if a man must run from any lawman's gun
W: He'll find compadres in the old Sierra Madre
W: 
W: Deep in the dark of night, beside the campfire's light,
W: They weave the tales of the lies, of the bandits.
W: Of jewels rare and old, of coaches filled with gold,
W: Holdups pulled off like they planned it.
W: 
W: But danger rides with those who stray upon their secret hideaway
W: Where death is sure to welcome anyone within the law

W: I have heard the cannons thundering all night
W: And I cannot sleep for wondering why's a rebel's cause so right
W: And the morphine seems to do no good at all
W: And I would run away it I would not fall
W: I joined the southern cavalry for fun
W: And I had rode a thousand horses
W: Always had a way with a gun
W: 
W: Now I'm among the horseless riders lying still
W: Swallowed up by the cause on the widows hill
W: And I dreamed about a rose in a Spanish garden
W: And I kissed you and I placed it in your hair
W: And if I'm ever on my feet again I will
W: And I will run all the way just to meet you there
W: 
W: Through the day I watched those southern boys go down
W: And they lay like Georgia peaches bruised and broken on the ground
W: Through the night I wondered was it worth the pain
W: And I cried not revenge I called your name

Q: 1/4=100

W: Free and easy, that should be her name
W: She took my loving for a nursery game
W: Well, the heart she gave me wasn't strong or made of stone
W: It was sweet and hollow like a honeycomb, well
W: 
W: Well superstition, it brought me bad luck:
W: When I was close to women, they were hidden by makeup
W: They spent their lives looking into a mirror
W: They never cared for nothing: they just cared for their figures
W: 
W: I need a love like a rock in stormy sea
W: You give me love like a rock, so won’t you rock with me?
W: Well now, ow
W: I met this woman I got love all in my head and
W: I've, uh, no room for anyone else in my bed now
W: She's not good-looking, she's got knots in her hair
W: But she's got ways that take her everywhere
W: 
W: She's got a love like a rock in stormy sea
W: She give me love like a rock, so won’t you rock with me?
W: Well now, ow
W: 
W: She won't have a doctor come, she's always gone from home
W: She won't love the man who won't leave her alone
W: She won't love a farmer 'cos she's always in the rain
W: She won't have a man for money or a big golden chain
W: 
W: Because she loves like a rock in a stormy sea
W: She give me love like a rock, so won't you rock with me?
W: Well now, ow
W: 
W: I love this woman, she’s got knots in her hair
W: But she's got ways that take her everywhere
W: I love her enough not to give her a ring
W: She's an angel but she'll never grow wings because
W: 
W: She loves like a rock in stormy sea
W: She give me love like a rock, so won’t you rock with me?
W: Well now, ow

W: [Chorus]
W: Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
W: "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
W: Once, I was seven years old
W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
W: Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
W: By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
W: Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure
W: [Chorus]
W: Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
W: "Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely"
W: Once, I was eleven years old
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: I always had that dream like my daddy before me
W: So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
W: Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
W: 'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
W: Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
W: Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
W: 'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
W: I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
W: And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
W: I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
W: Once, I was twenty years old
W: 
W: [Bridge]
W: Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
W: We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
W: Soon, we'll be thirty years old
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
W: So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
W: Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
W: And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
W: Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
W: I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
W: I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
W: 
W: [Breakdown]
W: Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
W: Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
W: Soon, I'll be sixty years old
W: Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
W: Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
W: Soon, I'll be sixty years old
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
W: "Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely"
W: Once I was seven years old

W: Take warning how you court your men
W: They’re like a star on a summer morning
W: They first appear and then they’re gone
W: 
W: They’ll tell to you some loving story
W: And they’ll make you think that they love you well
W: And away they’ll go and court some other
W: And leave you there in grief to dwell
W: 
W: I wish I was on some tall mountain
W: Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
W: I’d write a letter to my false true lover
W: Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
W: 
W: I wish I was a little sparrow
W: And I had wings to fly so high
W: I’d fly to the arms of my false true lover
W: And when he’d ask, I would deny
W: 
W: Oh love is handsome, love is charming
W: And love is pretty while it’s new
W: But love grows cold as love grows older
W: And fades away like morning dew

W: T’was early one morning a fair maid arose
W: And dressed herself up in the finest of clothes
W: And off to the shoemakers ship sure she goes
W: For a kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The cobbler he rose and he soon let her in, his arm
W: And his hammer were neat as a pin
W: And he had the will for the greet her son slim
W: With a kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Oh cobbler oh cobbler tis soon we’ll be wed
W: And nestling together in a fine feather bed
W: So give me too shoes with buckles of red
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The maid hid the shoes in the back of her waist,
W: She praised his good cobbling and shoemakers taste
W: And home to her father, she mournfully faced
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O father oh father I have got me a man
W: And he is the one I would web if I can
W: As handsome as ever in leather did stand
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Her father was thinking and thinking again
W: For to wed her to riches and have them for him
W: Who knows but it might be a prince or a king,
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: Who knows that it might be a jobber from town,
W: Or a wealthy sea captain who sails the world round?
W: A man with some thousands and thousands of pounds
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: So the father was smiling the daughter embraced,
W: And touching the buckles he drew back in haste
W: He spied the red shoes that were tied round her waist
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O daughter o daughter he started to shout,
W: When he did discover what she was about
W: God knows it was one but that old cobbling clout.
W: That she met in the morning early

W: Warm summer days by cool waterfalls,
W: Like the music we hear,
W: Those things we'll always hold dear,
W: Like an old fashioned waltz.
W: 
W: When the moonlight shines down
W: On the hollywood world,
W: And the heroine waits for her beau to return,
W: And violins play from behind garden walls,
W: How I'd love to remain with the silver refrain
W: Of an old fashioned waltz.
W: 
W: As they dance round the floor,
W: And there's no-one else there,
W: And the world is no more and there's never a care,
W: By the perfect lagoon where the nightingale calls,
W: With only the moon and the nostalgic tune
W: Of an old fashioned waltz.
W: 
W: Roses are red and violets are blue,

W: And it's hard at the end of the day
W: 
W: I need some distraction, oh beautiful release
W: Memories seep from my veins
W: They may be empty and weightless, and maybe
W: I'll find some peace tonight
W: 
W: In the arms of an Angel, fly away from here
W: From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear
W: You are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie
W: You're in the arms of an Angel; may you find some comfort here
W: 
W: So tired of the straight line, and everywhere you turn
W: There's vultures and thieves at your back
W: The storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies
W: That you make up for all that you lack
W: 
W: It don't make no difference, escaping one last time
W: It's easier to believe
W: In this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness
W: That brings me to my knees
W: 
W: In the arms of an Angel, far away from here
W: From this dark, cold hotel room, and the endlessness that you fear

W: I wish I was in Carrickfergus
W: Only for nights in Ballygrand
W: I would swim over the deepest ocean
W: The deepest ocean for my love to find
W: 
W: But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: If I could find me a handsome boatsman
W: To ferry me over to my love and die
W: 
W: My childhood days bring back sad reflections
W: Of happy times spent so long ago
W: My childhood friends and my own relations
W: Have all passed on now like melting snow
W: 
W: But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
W: Soft is the grass, my bed is free
W: Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
W: On that long road down to the sea
W: 
W: I'll spend my days in endless roaming
W: Soft is the grass, my bed is free
W: But I am sick now, and my days are numbered
W: Come all you young men and lay me down

W: And in green wood he was slain

W: Who is it, who sits all on my grave
W: And will not let me sepak

W: Who sits all on your grave
W: I ask of one kiss, from your sweet lips
W: And that is all I crave
W: 
W: My lips they are as clay my love
W: My breath is earthy strong
W: If thou was to kiss my lily white lips
W: Thy days would not be long
W: 
W: Look down in the yonder garden fair
W: Love, where we used to walk
W: The fairest flower that ever bloomed
W: Has withered unto a stalk

W: So will our hearts decay?
W: So make yourself content my love
W: Til death calls you away

W: Cold cold heart, Nora Jones
W: I've tried so hard my dear to show
W: That you're my every dream
W: Yet you're afraid each thing I do
W: Is just some evil scheme
W: 
W: A memory from your lonesome past
W: Keeps us so far apart
W: Why can't I free your doubtful mind
W: And melt your cold cold heart
W: 
W: Another love before my time
W: Made your heart sad an' blue
W: And so my heart is paying now
W: For things I didn't do
W: 
W: In anger unkind words are said
W: That make the teardrops start
W: Why can't I free your doubtful mind
W: And melt your cold cold heart
W: 
W: There was a time when I believed
W: That you belonged to me
W: But now I know your heart is shackled
W: To a memory

W: In the Year Of The Sheep and the burnin’ time

W: For the Gaels of Caledonia
W: There’s a den for the fox, a hedge for the hare
W: A nest in the tree for the birds of the air

W: It’s time tae hump yer load
W: Across the wild Atlantic

W: The bailiff came wi’ the writ and a’
W: And the gallant lads of the Forty Twa
W: They drove ye oot in the sleet and snaw
W: The Gaels of Caledonia
W: When yer house was burned and yer crops as well
W: Ye stood and wept in the blackened shell
W: And the winter moor was a living hell
W: For the Gaels of Caledonia
W: 
W: The plague and the famine they dragged ye doon
W: As ye made yer way tae Glesga toon
W: Where ye’d heard o’ a ship that was sailin’ soon
W: For the shores of Nova Scotia
W: And ye sold yer gear, ye paid yer fare
W: Wi’ yer heid held high though yer heart was sair
W: And ye bid farewell forever mair
W: Tae the glens of Caledonia
W: 
W: The land was cleared and the deal was made
W: Noo an English lord in a tartan plaid
W: He struts and stares as the memories fade
W: Of the Gaels of Caledonia
W: And he hunts the deer in the lonely glen
W: That once was home to a thousand men
W: And the wind on the moor sings a sad refrain
W: For the Gaels of Caledonia

W: But there's a wild and woolly woman you boys can't invite.
W: 
W: You can bring Pearl, she's a darn nice girl, But don't bring Lulu!
W: You can bring Rose with the turned-up nose, But don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu always wants to do, what the folks don't want her to
W: When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down!
W: 
W: You can bring cake or a porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu gets blue and goes cuckoo, like the clock upon the shelf.
W: She's the kind of smarty breaks up every party, Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself!
W: 
W: Last week we had a party, a real high-toned affair
W: And then along came Lulu, wild as any Zulu.
W: She started in to Charleston, and how the boys did stare,
W: But when she did the hula-hula, then she got the air.
W: 
W: You can bring Flo, her dad's got dough, But don't bring Lulu!
W: You can bring Lil, she's an awful pill, But don't bring Lulu!
W: 
W: Lulu has the reddest hair, redder here and redder there.
W: How can we boys keep our heads, bulls go wild when they see red
W: You can bring peas and crackers and cheese, but don't bring Lulu!
W: 
W: When she gets sore and slams the door, the plates fly off the shelf
W: She can make a feller wild on sarsaparilla, Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, She'll come here herself.
W: 
W: You can bring ham and crackers and jam, but don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu goes wild, and when she's wild, she climbs upon the shelf!
W: She can make a pastor be a dancing master, Hullabaloo-loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself!

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: When I was a fair maid about seventeen
W: I listed in the navy, for to serve the Queen
W: I listed in the navy, a sailor lad to stand
W: For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
W: And the music so grand, and the music so grand
W: For to hear the cannons rattle and the music so grand
W: 
W: Well, the officer that listed me was a tall and handsome man
W: He said, "You'll make a sailor, so come along, my man"
W: My waist being tall and slender, my fingers long and thin
W: Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
W: I soon exceeded them, I soon exceeded them
W: Oh the very soon they learned me, I soon exceeded them
W: 
W: Well, they sent me to bed and they sent me to bunk
W: To lie with a sailor, I never was afraid
W: But taking off my blue coat, it oft times made me smile
W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
W: And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while
W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
W: 
W: Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower
W: And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour
W: But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid
W: Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
W: My secret she betrayed, my secret she betrayed
W: Oh she went unto the captain and my secret she betrayed
W: 
W: Well, the captain, he came up to me and he asked if this was so
W: Oh I dare not, I dare not, I dare not say no
W: "It's a pity we should lose you, such a sailor lad you made
W: It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid
W: A handsome young maid, a handsome young maid
W: It's a pity we should lose you, such a handsome young maid"
W: 
W: So it's fare thee well, captain, you've been so kind to me
W: And likewise, my shipmates, I'm sorry to part with thee
W: But if ever the navy needs a lad, a sailor I'll remain
W: I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again
W: And I'll run the rigging again, I'll run the rigging again
W: I'll put out my hat and feathers and I'll run the rigging again

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Galileo's head was on the block
W: The crime was looking up for truth
W: And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
W: I try to trace them to my youth
W: 
W: And then you had to bring up reincarnation
W: Over a couple of beers the other night
W: And now I'm serving time for mistakes
W: Made by another in another lifetime
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
W: I call on the resting soul of galileo
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: And then I think about my fear of motion
W: Which I never could explain
W: Some other fool across the ocean years ago
W: Must have crashed his little airplane
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
W: I call on the resting soul of galileo
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: I'm not making a joke, you know me
W: I take everything so seriously
W: If we wait for the time till all souls get it right
W: Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation
W: In my lifetime I'm still not right
W: 
W: I offer thanks to those before me
W: That's all I've got to say
W: 'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime
W: Now I have to pay
W: But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
W: To let the next life off the hook
W: But she'll say "look what I had to overcome from my last life
W: I think I'll write a book"
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach the highest light
W: Except for Galileo God rest his soul
W: (Except for the resting soul of Galileo)
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: How long
W: (Till my soul gets it right)
W: [Til we reach the highest light]
W: How long
W: (Till my soul gets it right)
W: [Til we reach the highest light]
W: How long

W: Where are you going so early this morn,
W: She answered, kind sir to visit my neighbours,
W: I'm going down to Lincoln the place I was born.
W: 
W: Oh may I go with you my fair pretty lady,
W: May I go along in your sweet company,
W: She turned her head round and smiling all at me,
W: Said you may come with me kind sir if you please.
W: 
W: We hadn't been walking a few miles together,
W: Before this young damsel began to show free,
W: She sat herself down saying sit down beside me,
W: The game we shall play will be one, two and three.
W: 
W: I said my dear lady if you're fond of the gaming,
W: There's one game I know I would like you to learn,
W: The game it is called The Game Of All Fours,
W: So I took out my pack and began the first turn.
W: 
W: She cut the cards and I fell a dealing,
W: I dealt her a trump and myself the poor Jack,
W: She led off here ace and stole the Jack from me,
W: Saying Jack is the card I like best in your pack.
W: 
W: I dealt the last time, its your turn to shuffle,
W: My turn to show the best card in the pack,
W: Once more she'd the ace and stole the Jack from me,
W: Once more I lost when I laid down poor Jack.
W: 
W: So I took up my hat and I bid her good morning,
W: I said you're the best that I know at this game,
W: She answered, young man, come back tomorrow,
W: We'll play the game over and over and over and over and over again

T: I Hear You Breathing In
C:Eleanor McEvoy
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: When I wake from dreaming, in the middle of the night
W: You're asleep and yet you say In your own sweet silent way
W: That everything's alright
W: 
W: And your hair is lying , across the pillow by my head
W: You're unconscious to the night
W: You can't talk but that's all right
W: Let your breathing speak instead
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I hear you breathing in
W: You breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: Well, I don't turn on the light
W: I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me
W: 
W: Senses can deceive me , when I'm sleepy and confused
W: From my heavy eyes I see , only darkness around me
W: My dreams long since excused.
W: Then my thoughts go racing , through the cloisters of my brain
W: In those midnight hours I find , that you hypnotize my mind
W: With your soothing pulse again
W: I hear you breathing in,  you breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: I don't turn on the light , I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I hear you breathing in
W: You breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: Well, I don't turn on the light
W: I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me

C:Thomas P. Westendorf
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I'll take you home again, Kathleen
W: Across the ocean wild and wide
W: To where your heart has ever been
W: Since you were first my bonnie bride.
W: The roses all have left your cheek.
W: I've watched them fade away and die
W: Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
W: And tears bedim your loving eyes.
W: Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
W: To where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I'II take you to your home again!
W: 
W: I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
W: Your heart was ever fond and true.
W: I always feel when you are near
W: That life holds nothing, dear, but you.
W: The smiles that once you gave to me
W: I scarcely ever see them now
W: Though many, many times I see
W: A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
W: 
W: To that dear home beyond the sea
W: My Kathleen shall again return.
W: And when thy old friends welcome thee
W: Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
W: Where laughs the little silver stream
W: Beside your mother's humble cot
W: And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
W: There all your grief will be forgot.

C:Michelle Shocked
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: 
W: I kicked in his door at five a.m.,
W: "I've come for my bike" I told the repo man.
W: My 920's gonna take me far today,
W: You can travel for miles and never leave L.A.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I drive by the Plaza where the gay boys pose,
W: Stand in their windows wearing no clothes.
W: I heard the screams of the dying dark,
W: Through the sweet green icing of MacArthur Park.
W: And then I crossed the river into East L.A.
W: Pescado mojado me encontre.
W: And I've giving up on rock 'n roll,
W: And I'm saving up for norteno.
W: The river she runs by the railroad tracks,
W: I swear I'll never take it back.
W: A train, she cries on the midnight hour,
W: All along the Watts Tower.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I gunned it down to San Pedro Bay,
W: Watched my ship sail in, watched her sail away.
W: The sun was sinking into the sea.
W: But a ball of fire inside of me,
W: Was burning my motor and driving me hard,
W: Past the big hair on the Boulevard.
W: And up Mulholland where I made the scene,
W: Like the one that took little Jimmy Dean.
W: And then I shimmied up Wilshire like a little silk worm,
W: Past the rodeo and the pachyderm.
W: And then I stopped for coffee at an art cafe,
W: I saw the repo man and made my getaway.
W: Doing the Eagle Rock,
W: Heading for the hills.
W: Oh try to let my engines cool.
W: And it is not my fault that this town shakes,
W: I saw the falling rock and I hit my brakes.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: Now you tow it to the repo man's front door,
W: And you give him these keys, I don't need them no more.
W: You tow it to the repo man's front door,
W: And you give him these keys, I don't need them no more.

W: So whether you sing or pull a pint you'll always have a job,
W: 'Cause where ever you go around the world you'll find an Irish pub.
W: 
W: Now the owner is Norwegian and the manager comes from Cork,
W: And the lad that's holding up the bar says 'Only Eejits Work'
W: He was born and bred in Bolton but his mammy's from Kildare,
W: And he's going to make his fortune soon and move to County Clare.
W: 
W: They've got one in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,

W: 
W: 
W: Now it's time for me to go I have to catch me train,
W: So I'll leave ye sitting at the bar and face the wind and rain,
W: For I'll have that pint you owe me, if I'm not gone on the dry,
W: When we meet next week in Frankford in the fields of Athenry.
W: 
W: They've got one in Honolulu they've got one in Moscow too,

W: Oh it's gone half past two boys it's time to unyoke
W: Unharness your horses and rub them down well
W: And I'll give you a jug of my very best ale

W: Hello to your Mrs and to your 4 children, may they grow healthy and strong.
W: Michael has got in a wee bit of trouble, I guess that he never will learn.
W: Because of the dampness there's no turf to speak of and now we have nothing to burn.
W: And Brigid is happy, you named a child for her, Aathough she's got six of her own.
W: You say you found work, but you don't say what kind or when you will be coming home.
W: 
W: Kilkelly, Ireland, 18 and 80, Michael and John, my dear sons
W: I'm sorry to give you the very sad news that your dear old mother has gone.
W: We buried her down at the church in Kilkelly, your brothers and Brigid were there.
W: You don't have to worry.  She died very quickly, remember her in your prayers.
W: And it's so good to hear that Michael's returning, with money he's sure to buy land.
W: For the crop has been poor and the people are selling for any price that they can.
W: 
W: Kilkelly, Ireland, 18 and 90, my dear and loving son John
W: I guess that I must be close on to eighty, It's thirty years since you're gone.
W: Because of all of the money you send me, I'm still living out on my own.
W: Michael has built himself a fine house and Brigid's daughters have grown.
W: Thank you for sending your family picture, they're lovely young women and men.
W: You say that you might even come for a visit, what joy to see you again.
W: 
W: Kilkelly, Ireland, 18 and 92, my dear brother John
W: I'm sorry I didn't write sooner to tell you that father passed on.
W: He was living with Brigid.  Se says he was cheerful and healthy right down to the end.
W: Ah, you should have seen him play with the grandchildren of Pat McNamara, your friend.
W: And we buried him alongside of mother, down at the Kilkelly churchyard.
W: He was a strong and a feisty old man, considering his life was so hard.
W: And it's funny the way he kept talking about you, he called for you in the end.
W: Oh, why don't you think about coming to visit, we'd all love to see you again.

T: Love Has Come for You
C:Steve Marin and Edie Brickell
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: She had a child by that man from the bank. He was married with a son All of her family said, "Give that child away "Try to erase what you've done"
W: 
W: But when she held that sweet boy in her arms
W: None of their words meant a thing. And when she held that sweet boy in her arms She heard the quiet angels sing.
W: 
W: Love, love, love has come for you Love, love, love has come for you.
W: 
W: He grew up strong with a heart full of dreams And a good mind to make them come true. He never gave her a day's worth of grief She lit up when he came into the room.
W: 
W: Love, love, love has come for you Love, love, love has come for you.
W: 
W: 
W: And she believed till the day that she died He was given from Heaven on high. And on that day, he was right there by her side. When she heard the angels one more time.
W: 
W: Love, love, love has come for you Love, love, love has come for you.

W: Too misty, and too much in love.

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Memories of East Texas
W: And piney green rolling hills
W: Covered in the springtime
W: With golden daffodils
W: Rowing on Sandy Lake come April
W: Harvesting hay in June
W: Sitting by the road watching well-fires burn
W: By an old October moon
W: I learned to drive on those East Texas red clay backroads
W: And I mean to tell you my friend
W: They weren't no easy roads
W: You had to watch out for all the curves
W: Down by Kelsey Creek
W: And detour through the Lindsay's pasture
W: When the water ran too deep
W: Memories of East Texas
W: And Gilmer, county seat of Upshur
W: Looking back and asking myself
W: 'What the hell'd you let them break your spirit for?'
W: You know, their lives ran in circles so small
W: Ah, they thought they'd seen it all
W: And they could not make a place for a girl who'd seen the ocean
W: I learned to drive on those East Texas red clay backroads
W: And I mean to tell you my friend
W: They weren't no easy roads
W: You had to watch out for all the curves
W: Down by Kelsey Creek
W: And detour through the Lindsay's pasture
W: When the water ran too deep
W: Fiddle breakÊ
W: Ah, but those memories of East Texas
W: Those piney green rolling hills
W: Covered in the springtime

W: Sitting in those Piney Woods
W: Playing my guitar

W: Thinking I had not come that far...

B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: \Someone is tossing petals in a stream
W: Somewhere someone standing at
W: At the foothills of their dreams
W: Someone got a paintbrush,
W: Is painting over doubts
W: Someone opened up his eyes and
W: Saw the sun coming out
W: Someone was captive and found the courage to get off
W: From a boulder in well, somewhere the
W: Rain has stopped
W: Someone is finding the place where they belong
W: 
W: Everyday is summer
W: Somewhere in the world
W: Summer boys are headed for the falls
W: To kiss the girls
W: With their impatient hands groping honey breasts and curls
W: They are filled with desire
W: And high in the hills there's a baby being born
W: As forgiveness and peace wash over bruises sores
W: People bridging the distance over nettles and thorns
W: {c: CHORUS}
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
W: If the faucet is tightened up the love won't flow
W: If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
W: If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow
W: 
W: A rich man counting money, a tired man counting sheep
W: While the safe man counts his blessings, the hungry man has beans
W: There's a million people praying, raising up their eyes
W: To what turns out to be the same god, the same sky
W: We are slightly scared of death, a little bit afraid
W: So we celebrate everything we can think to celebrate
W: We shall sing out loud to keep the hounds away
W: 
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
W: If the facuet is tightened up the love won't flow
W: If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
W: If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow
W: 
W: Prisons will crumble and governments will fall
W: It's the order of freedom to be preceded by walls
W: Cause the truth would be worthless if no one ever lied
W: So we carry our shame in the interest of pride
W: And we have all these questions to make us go roamÊ
W: And weÕve got all this distance to make us come home
W: As the sun burns, a child learns, the tide churns, the world turns
W: 
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
W: If the facuet is tightened up the love won't flow
W: If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
W: If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow

T: My Old Kentucky Home
C:Stephen Foster
B: songs
B: traditional songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: "My Old Kentucky Home," originally titled "Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night!," is the state song of Kentucky.
W: 
W: The facts surrounding the composition of this song point to the influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin rather than a visit to Kentucky. Foster may or may not have visited his cousins in Bardstown, Kentucky at their mansion Federal Hill, but the original sketch of this song, dating from 1852, substitutes "Poor Uncle Tom" for "My Old Kentucky Home" and aligns Foster's sympathies with the Abolitionist movement.
W: =========================
W: 
W: Verse 1:
W: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
W: ‘Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
W: The corn-top’s ripe and the meadow’s in the bloom,
W: While the birds make music all the day.
W: The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
W: All merry, all happy and bright;
W: By ‘n’ by Hard Times comes a-knocking at the door,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Weep no more my lady
W: Oh! weep no more today!
W: We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,
W: For the Old Kentucky Home far away.
W: 
W: Verse 2:
W: They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
W: On meadow, the hill and the shore,
W: They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
W: On the bench by the old cabin door.
W: The day goes by like a shadow o’er the heart,
W: With sorrow, where all was delight,
W: The time has come when the darkies have to part,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3:
W: The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
W: Wherever the darky may go;
W: A few more days, and the trouble all will end,
W: In the field where the sugar-canes grow;
W: A few more days for to tote the weary load,
W: No matter, ’twill never be light;
W: A few more days till we totter on the road,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I was just a small town country boy
W: When I left that country town
W: Route 66 to the Westward
W: And hopped an old freight down
W: California here I come
W: By the side door Pullman and the sunburnt thumb
W: And they called us Okies, lowdown bums
W: And the police on us frowned
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: Never tire of the road
W: Never tire of the rolling wheel
W: Never tire of the ways of the world
W: Way out yonder is a-calling me
W: And the dark road leads me onwards
W: And the highway, that's my code
W: And the lonesome voice that I heard said
W: Never tire of the road
W: 
W: California to the New York Island
W: Me and my guitar
W: And we played in many a hobo jungle
W: Many a skid row bar
W: Standing out in the wind and the rain
W: That lonesome whistle is a sweet refrain
W: When you are waiting for some old freight train
W: That carries an empty car.
W: 
W: Don't let them ever fool you
W: Or take you by surprise
W: That dirty smell of a politician
W: And the man with the greed in his eyes
W: One big union, that's our plan
W: And the IWW"s your only man
W: The flames of discontent we'll fan
W: For the cause that never dies

W: To put me through my evening prayers
W: And I just lying down?"

W: And she's praying for you and me"

W: 'Til she would rise and see

W: Didn't I rock her well?

W: I'll rock her into hell"

Q: 1/4=100

W: Young Roger the miller came courting of late
W: To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate
W: She had for her fortune a many fine things
W: Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings
W: Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground
W: She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds
W: 
W: Then the money and supper, they both were laid down
W: Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds
W: The sight of that money and beauty likewise
W: Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes
W: "Now that your daughter and money is here
W: 'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"
W: 
W: Then the money and supper were taken from sight
W: And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight
W: Roger was taken and shown out the door
W: And ordered not for to come there anymore
W: 'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair
W: Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"
W: 
W: Now it was when six months, they were over and past
W: And Roger the miller, he met with his lass
W: "I think I do know you then, madam," said he
W: "I am the same way with you, sir," said she
W: "A man with your features with fine yellow hair
W: Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"
W: 
W: "Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came
W: But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name
W: I thought that your father would never dispute
W: To give me the gray mare with you to boot
W: And not to risk lose such a dutiful son
W: Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"
W: 
W: "For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard
W: For there's plenty of men in this town to be had
W: If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see
W: But now you have neither the gray mare nor me
W: The price of that mare, it was never so great
W: Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"
W: 
W: Now Roger's away to his desolate home
W: And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone
W: Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay
W: She has wed a young miller who works the long day
W: Lads, when you're courting, be always aware
W: To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Thrown off the bridge to the river by the bridge was the iron mountain baby. A man walking by said he heard a little cry and he found him in a suitcase.
W: 
W: Fifty feet down from the train to the ground it's a miracle that he survived. What are the chances that a man would be standin' there and take him home to his wife.
W: 
W: Sarah Jane Sarah Jane Be a mama to the boy from the train
W: 
W: Five days old with a hand that could hold in a grip around your finger. Old Sarah Jane no she never did complain 'cause she loved the little Stranger.
W: 
W: She brought him back to health and she kept him for herself when some women tried to claim him. "If you'd been a good mama then you never would've wanna gone and thrown him off of the train then".
W: 
W: A picture in the paper showed the baby like an angel with the savior and the suitcase. What kind of devil could have thrown the little fellow off the train in the first place.
W: 
W: His mama musta died givin' birth to the child and the daddy went crazy. Got on the train with a heart full of pain and took it out on the baby.
W: 
W: Sarah Jane Sarah Jane Be a mama to the boy from the train
W: Woo oo baby! Woo oo you're my baby now
W: 
W: A civil war vet went to see if he could get a bit of timber for a new barn. The number 4 sped from the train overhead came the itty bitty newborn.

W: People are talkin' 'bout people
W: I hear them whisper, you won't believe it
W: They think we're lovers kept under covers
W: I just ignore it, but they keep saying
W: We laugh just a little too loud
W: We stand just a little too close
W: We stare just a little too long
W: Maybe they're seeing something we don't, Darlin'
W: 
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: Let's give them something to talk about
W: How about love?
W: 
W: I feel so foolish, I never noticed
W: You'd act so nervous,
W: Could you be falling for me?
W: It took a rumor to make me wonder
W: Now I'm convinced I'm going under
W: Thinking 'bout you every day
W: Dreaming 'bout you every night
W: Hoping that you feel the same way
W: Now that we know it, let's really show it, Darlin'

W: Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you
W: Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
W: Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
W: Suitcases of memories, time after--
W: 
W: Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
W: You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
W: Then you say, go slow, I fall behind, the second hand unwinds
W: 
W: If you're lost you can look--and you will find me, time after time
W: if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting, time after time
W: 
W: After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
W: Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
W: Secrets stolen from deep inside the drum beats out of time--
W: 
W: you said go slow, I fall behind, the second hand unwinds--

W: And all that I had heard were our hearts beating

W: Talk to me while I'm listening now
W: While this love has a voice that we both can hear
W: Before you let it go
W: The greatest love I've ever known
W: Won't you please talk to me while I'm listening
W: 
W: I cannot find a place to put this love away
W: Or lost the thought of sunlight on your face
W: I thought I heard your voice
W: Say I love today
W: But it was only the sound of my heart breaking
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: How I wish that I could take us back to Germany
W: And I would stay awake and you would talk to me
W: Yet for every drop of rain I hear
W: There's bound to fall another tear

W: So he held the sign up higher so no decent soul could miss it
W: It was ten degrees or colder down by bolder dam that day
W: 
W: He was raised up in Milwaukee tho he never was that famous
W: He was just a road musician to the taverns he would go
W: Singing songs about the rambling the loving girls and gambling
W: How the world fell on his shoulders back in Boulder I don't know
W: 
W: It was out in Arizona he heard the lady listening
W: To each word that he was saying to each line that he would write
W: So he sat down by her table and they talked about the weather
W: Ninety-eight point six and rising down by Boulder dam that night
W: 
W: And she told him she would take him, for a ride, morning sun
W: Back in Boulder he told her, don't know when, better friend
W: 
W: Now he's traded off his Martin but his troubles are not over
W: His feet are almost frozen and the sun is sinking low
W: Won't you listen to me brother if you ever loved your mother
W: Please pull off on the shoulder if you're going Milwaukee way
W: 
W: It's ten degrees and getting colder down by Boulder dam today

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: As fame reports a young duke kept a court
W: He pleased himself with his frolicsome sport
W: He found a poor tinker lying drunk on the ground
W: In such a deep sleep he heard not a sound
W: 
W: He said to his men, Richard, William, and Ben
W: We'll away to my palace and we'll sport with him then
W: He was carefully carried to the palace so grand
W: None would compare in all of this land
W: 
W: They stripped him down bare and he had not a care
W: They washed down his body, his face and his hair
W: They put on a nightgown of bright crimson and red
W: And left him to sleep in the duke's golden bed
W: 
W: In the morning when day, then admiring he lay
W: For to see the rich chamber both gaudy and gay
W: He looked all around him and was so amazed
W: And admired how he to this honor was raised
W: 
W: Though he seemed somewhat mute, he chose a rich suit
W: Which he straightway put on without longer dispute
W: From a place of convenience, the duke his good grace
W: Observed the man, in every case
W: 
W: A fine dinner was dressed both for him and his guests
W: He was placed at the table above all the rest
W: He had wine, he had brandy and soon he did snore
W: Being seven times drunker than ever before
W: 
W: Then the duke did ordain they should strip him again
W: And restore him to a tinker, and to ever remain
W: Again he was carried to the side of the road
W: Back once again where they first found their load
W: 
W: He slept all the night as indeed he well might
W: But when he did waken his joys took their flight
W: Oh the power and the glory so pleasant did seem
W: He thought it to be but a mere golden dream

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One fine winter's morn my horn I did blow
W: To the green fields of Keady for hours we did go
W: We gathered our dogs and we circled around
W: For none loves the sport better than the boys in the dell.
W: 
W: And when we arrived they were all standing there
W: We set off for the fields, boys, in search of a hare
W: We didn't get far till someone gave the cheer
W: Over high hills and valleys the sweet puss did steer
W: 
W: As we flew o'er the hills, 'twas a beautiful sight
W: There was dogs black and yellow, there was dogs black and white
W: As she took the black bank for to try them once more
W: Oh it was her last look o'er the hills of Greenmore.
W: 
W: In a field of wheat stubble this pussy did lie
W: And Rory and Charmer they did pass her by
W: And there where we stood at the top of the brae
W: We heard the last words that this sweet puss did say:
W: 
W: No more o'er the green fields of Keady I'll roam
W: Nor trip through the fields, boys, in sport and in fun
W: Or hear the long horn that your toner does play
W: I'll go home to my den by the clear light of day.
W: 
W: You may blame ol' MacMahon for killing the hare
W: For he's at his ol' capers this many's a year
W: On Saturday and Sunday he never gives o'er
W: With a pack of strange dogs round the hills of Greenmore

W: When I was at home I was merry and frisky,
W: My dad kept a pig and my mother sold whisky,
W: My uncle was rich, but never would by aisey
W: Till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey.
W: Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey,
W: My dear little Shelah, I thought would run crazy,
W: When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey.
W: 
W: I marched from Kilkenny, and, as I was thinking
W: On Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking,
W: But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,
W: For fear of a drubbing from Corporal Casey.
W: Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey!
W: The devil go with him, I ne'er could be lazy,
W: He struck my shirts so, ould Corporal Casey.
W: 
W: We went into battle, I took the blows fairly
W: That fell on my pate, but they bothered me rarely,
W: And who should the first be that dropped, why, and please ye,
W: It was my good friend, honest Corporal Casey.
W: Och! rub a dub, row de dow, Corporal Casey!
W: Thinks I you are quiet, and I shall be aisey,
W: So eight years I fought without Corporal Casey.

W: It was on the month of sweet July, before the sun shone in the sky
W: Down between two rigs of rye, I heard to lovers talking
W: 
W: He said “Lassie Lassie I must go away, and so no longer can I stay”
W: But before I’ve a word or two to say, if you’ve a mind for to tarry
W: 
W: Of you your father he takes good care and your mother too
W: She combs down your yellow hair
W: And your sisters too says you’ll get no share if you follow me love, a stranger
W: 
W: He said “Lassie Lassie your fortune it is but small and perhaps its true that you have none at all
W: And I’m not a match love for you at all, so go and give your love to another
W: 
W: Oh my father can fret and my mother can frown and my sisters too I do disown
W: And if they were dead and below the ground I’d still follow you love, you’re no Stanger
W: 
W: But this Lassie’s courage began to fade, and her rosie cheeks they soon grew worn and pale
W: And the tears came trickling down like hail or a heavy shower in summer
W: 
W: And he’s taken her kerchief of linen so fine and he’s kissed her lips and then he’s dried her eyes
W: Saying weep no more love, for you shall be mine and all that I said was to try you
W: 
W: And this laddie was of courage bold a gallant chief just 19 years old
W: And he’s made the hills and the valleys to roam and the young bonnie lass ahs gone with him
W: 
W: And this couple they are married now and they have babies one and two
W: And they live in Breechen the winter through, aye, and in the Montrose in the summer

T: The Town I Loved So Well
C:Phil Coulter
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: In my memory, I will always see
W: The town that I have loved so well
W: Where our school played ball by the old gas yard wall
W: And they laughed through the smoke and the smell
W: Going home in the rain, running up the dark lane
W: Past the jail, and down behind the Fountain
W: Those were happy days in so many, many ways
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: In the early morning the shirt factory horn
W: Called women from Creggan, the moor, and the bog
W: While the men on the dole played a mother's role
W: Fed the children and then walked the dog
W: And when times got tough there was just about enough
W: And they saw it through without complaining
W: For deep inside was a burning pride
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: There was music there in the Derry air
W: Like a language that we all could understand
W: I remember the day that I earned my first pay
W: When I played in a small pick-up band
W: There I spent my youth, and to tell you the truth
W: I was sad to leave it all behind me
W: For I learned about life, and I found a wife
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: But when I returned, how my eyes have burned
W: To see how a town could be brought to it's knees
W: By the armoured cars and the bombed-out bars
W: And the gas that hangs on to every breeze
W: Now the army's installed by that old gas yard wall
W: And the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
W: With their tanks and their guns, oh my god, what have they done
W: To the town I loved so well
W: 
W: Now the music's gone but they carry on
W: For their spirits been bruised, never broken
W: They will not forget but their hearts are set
W: On tomorrow and peace once again
W: For what's done is done and what's won is won
W: And what's lost is lost and gone for ever
W: I can only pray for a bright, brand new day
W: In the town I love so well

W: And her name it was ca'd pretty Peggy-o
W:

W: Came tripping o'er the plain
W: He came unto a farmer's door
W: A lodging for to gain
W: The farmer's daughter she came down
W: And viewed him cheek and chin
W: She says "He is a handsome man
W: I pray you take him in"
W: 
W: We'll go no more a roving
W: A roving in the night
W: We'll go no more a roving
W: Let the moon shine so bright
W: We'll go no more a roving
W: 
W: He would not lie within the barn
W: Nor yet within the byre
W: But he would in the corner lie
W: Down by the kitchen fire
W: O then the beggar's bed was made
W: Of good clean sheets and hay
W: And down beside the kitchen fire
W: The jolly beggar lay
W: 
W: The farmer's daughter she got up
W: To bolt the kitchen door
W: And there she saw the beggar
W: Standing naked on the floor
W: He took the daughter in his arms
W: And to the bed he ran
W: Kind sir, she says, be easy now
W: You'll waken our goodman
W: 
W: Now you are no beggar
W: You are some gentleman
W: For you have stolen my maidenhead
W: And I am quite undone
W: I am no lord, I am no squire
W: Of beggars I be one
W: And beggars they be robbers all
W: So you're quite undone

W: For king and country, for king and country we will fight today

W: Where the boys ignored the girls
W: And we all pretended to like the band
W: 
W: This shirt was a pillow for my head
W: On a train through Italy
W: This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
W: We made in Argeles
W: This shirt was lost for three whole days
W: In a town near Buffalo
W: 'Till I found the locker key
W: In a downtown Trailways bus depot
W: 
W: 
W: This shirt was the one I lent you
W: And when you gave it back
W: There was a rip inside the sleeve
W: Where you rolled your cigarettes
W: It was the place I put my heart
W: Now look at where you put a tear
W: I forgave your thoughtlessness
W: But not the boy who put it there
W: 
W: This shirt was the place your cat
W: Decided to give birth to five
W: And we stayed up all night watching
W: And we wept when the last one died
W: This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
W: Shining like the memories
W: Inside those silver buttons
W: 
W: This shirt is a grand old relic
W: With a grand old history
W: I wear it now for Sunday chores
W: Cleaning house and raking leaves
W: I wear it beneath my jacket
W: With the collar turned up high
W: So old I should replace it
W: But I'm not about to try

W: Union Station
W: 
W: He blew out of the south wind to Chicago
W: Left him stranded in Nashville, Ten-acy
W: Now he’s waiting down at Union Station
W: For that old dixie flyer to fly her home again
W: 
W: She blew him a kiss and a promise; he caught it on his cheek and promised too. That they’d meet here again in Union station. And love was a flower in the Spring of 32
W: 
W: The season came and went without a letter to explain
W: Why all the trains would roll in empty and then roll back pout again
W: 
W: He saw Hank Williams step down from the Georgia and Patsy Cline aboard the Hummingbird. All the stars who pass through Union Station and while the crowd waits to see them he still waits for her.
W: 
W: In 76 he saw the builders close the station down. And it became the finest hotel that had ever grazed this town.
W: 
W: But he still hears the freight train to Chicago but its just the sound a fright trains passing through; he drinks coffee while he waits at union station hotel and while the crowd waits to see them he still waits for her.

W: And now, smile a smile for me.

W: All the world seems bright and gay.
W: And when Irish eyes are smiling,
W: Sure, they steal your heart away.
W: 
W: For your smile is a part
W: Of the love in your heart,
W: And it makes even sunshine more bright.
W: Like the linnet's sweet song,
W: Crooning all the day long,
W: Comes your laughter and light.

W: Is the sweetest of all
W: There is ne'er a real care or regret;
W: And while springtime is ours
W: Throughout all of youth's hours,
W: Let us smile each chance we get.

W: I courted a wee girl for many's the long day
W: And I slighted all others that came in my way
W: But now she's rewarded me to the last day
W: She's gone to be wed to another.
W: 
W: The bride and bride's party to church they did go
W: The bride she rode foremost she put the best show
W: And I followed after with a heart full of woe
W: To see my love wed to another.
W: 
W: The bride and bride's party in church they did stand
W: Gold rings on their fingers, a love by the hand
W: The man that she's wed to he has houses and land
W: He may have her since I couldn't gain her.
W: 
W: The next time I say her she was seated down neat
W: I sat down beside her not a bite could I eat
W: For I thought my love's company far better than meat
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.
W: 
W: The last time I saw her she was all dressed in white
W: And the more I gazed on her she dazzled my sight
W: I lifted my hat and I bade her goodnight
W: Here's adieu to all false-hearted lovers.
W: 
W: I courted that wee girl for many's the long day
W: And I slighted all others that came in my way
W: But now she's rewarded me to the last day
W: She's gone to be wed to another.
W: 
W: So dig me a grave and dig it down deep
W: And strew it all over with primrose so sweet
W: And lay me down easy for no more to weep
W: Since love was the cause of my ruin.

W: I was coming from the fair at Cappamore
W: I was driving home thirty pair of heifers by the way
W: And by chance I stood outside a cottage door
W: I just dropped in to light me pipe as any lad might do

W: Twas then me heart felt really very quare.

W: When the hawthorns blossoms are in bloom
W: And to sit by me gate on that auld mossy seat
W: Whispering to Kate Muldoon
W: 
W: I was coming from me farm down a neighbouring boreen
W: When I met me Kitty tripping like a fawn
W: She gave me such a smile that I felt like in a dream
W: And I never slept a wink that night 'till dawn
W: And the next time that I met her sure I told her of me love
W: She blushed and nearly let her basket fall
W: And she said 'Go on ye skimmer' with a gentle little shove
W: 
W: And that I'd ask me father that was all.
W: I love to ramble down the old boreen,
W: When the hawthorns blossums are in bloom
W: And to sit by me gate on that auld mossy seat

W: Said Patsy Hogan what is this I heard,
W: You've been speaking to me daughter now what have you to say
W: Was then I couldn't say a single word
W: Then he took me by the hand and said Patrick me son
W: I'd be glad to see you settled well in life
W: And since you love me daughter and her heart is fairly won
W: 
W: At shroue time you can make the girl your wife.

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: As I was a-walkin' one fine summer's day
W: Oh, the fields they were in blossom and the meadows were gay
W: I met a wee lassie trippin' over the green
W: I took her for Helen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: The Grecian queen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: I took her for Helen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: 
W: She's admired by many, I know them right well
W: Each morning to view the sweet spot where she dwells
W: Beneath the downs at the brink of yonder hill
W: May she never marry, but think on me still
W: But think on me still, but think on me still
W: May she never marry, but think on me still
W: 
W: Oh, me parents dote on me, and it's all for their sake
W: And its ofttimes it causes my poor heart to break
W: But the more I think on them, the more I'm inclined to say
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: 
W: So it's fare thee well, me darlin', I love you the best
W: And may you be happy, and may you be blessed
W: And may you think on me when that I am far away
W: For there's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: 
W: In faith there is a decline(?) under yond forest sky
W: And straightway to my true love I surely will fly
W: 
W: And no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae

W: The water is wide, I cannot get oer
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: Give me a boat that can carry two
W: And both shall row, my love and I
W: 
W: A ship there is and she sails the sea
W: She's loaded deep as deep can be
W: But not so deep as the love I'm in
W: I know not if I sink or swim
W: 
W: I leaned my back against an oak
W: Thinking it was a trusty tree
W: But first it bent and then it broke
W: So did my love prove false to me
W: 
W: I reached my finger into some soft bush
W: Thinking the fairest flower to find
W: I pricked my finger to the bone
W: And left the fairest flower behind
W: 
W: Oh love be handsome and love be kind
W: Gay as a jewel when first it is new
W: But love grows old and waxes cold
W: And fades away like the morning dew
W: 
W: Must I go bound while you go free
W: Must I love a man who doesn't love me
W: Must I be born with so little art
W: As to love a man who'll break my heart
W: 
W: When cockle shells turn silver bells
W: Then will my love come back to me
W: When roses bloom in winter's gloom
W: Then will my love return to me

W: 
W: Now and then I think of when we were together
W: 
W:

W: Am, G, Am, G, Am,G, Am, G
W: 
W: You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness

W: 
W: Well you said that we would still be friends
W: 
W: But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

W: 
W: And that feels so rough
W: 
W: You didn't have to stoop so low
W: 
W: Have your friends collect your records

W: Verse 3:
W: 
W: Am       G             Am                  G          Am  G Am G

W: 
W: And I don't wanna live that way
W: 
W: F      Am      G
W: 
W: Reading into every word you say

W: F      Am        G
W: 
W: You said that you could let it go
W: 
W: F      Am         G
W: 
W: And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

W: Oh the night came undone like a party dress
W: And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
W: The smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls
W: And they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls
W: 
W: Well she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind
W: And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
W: But leave all the blue skies for the rest of the world
W: Because the neon will shine for the barroom girls
W: 
W: Oh the barroom girls go by your side
W: Like the ponies who pass on a carousel ride
W: And all of the colors go 'round in a swirl
W: When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls
W: Now she rolls to her feet when she can't sleep no more
W: And looks at her clothes lying out on the floor
W: Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
W: Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls
W: Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
W: Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

W: They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom
W: For tryin' to change the system from within
W: I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them
W: First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
W: 
W: I'm guided by a signal in the heavens

W: I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons
W: First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

W: I'd really like to live beside you, baby
W: I love your body and your spirit and your clothes
W: But you see that line there moving through the station?
W: I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those
W: Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win
W: You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline
W: How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin
W: First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin
W: 
W: I don't like your fashion business, mister
W: And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin
W: I don't like what happened to my sister

W: Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
W: Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
W: The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
W: Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
W: The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
W: My love he wooed me as I lie there
W: With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy
W: Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush
W: 
W: When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom
W: The blackberry blossom was white as the snow
W: But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses
W: And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow
W: The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon
W: Known for his cackling and his screaming
W: Driving away the swallow and the thrush
W: From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush
W: 
W: I was picking berries when that crow flew above me
W: Carrying my lover so far away
W: Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom
W: By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay
W: The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard
W: With weeds growing over in the old graveyard
W: And the day settles down to an evening hush
W: Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush

W: I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

W: You raise the blade, you make the change,

W: 
W: And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear,
W: 
W: You shout and no one seems to hear,
W: And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes,

W: In the cool of the evening they used to gather beneath the stars, in the meadow, circled near an old oak tree.
W: 
W: At the times appointed by the seasons of the earth and the phases of the moon.
W: 
W: In the centre often stood a woman, equal to the others and respected for her worth.
W: 
W: One of the many we call the witches, the healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth.
W: 
W: People grew in the knowledge she gave them, herbs to heal their bodies spells to make their spirits whole.
W: 
W: Hear them chanting healing incantations-calling for the wise ones celebrating in dance and song.
W: 
W: ISIS-ASTARTE-DIANA-HECATI-DEMETER-KALI-INANNA
W: 
W: There were those who came to power through domination, bonded in their worship of a dead man on the cross.
W: 
W: They sought control over all people, demanding allegiance to the church of Rome.
W: 
W: The pope commenced the inquisition – a war against women whose powers were feared.
W: 
W: In this holocaust, this century of evil, nine million European women died.
W: 
W: The tale is told of those who by the hundreds, holding hands together chose their deaths in the sea.
W: 
W: Chanting the praises of the mother goddess, a refusal of betrayal, women were dying to be free.
W: 
W: ISIS-ASTARTE-DIANA-HECATI-DEMETER-KALI-INANNA
W: 
W: Now the Earth is a witch, we still burn her, stripping her down with mining and the poison of our wars.
W: 
W: Still to us the Earth is still a healer a teacher and a Mother a weaver of a web that keeps us all alive.
W: 
W: She gives us the wisdom to see through the chaos, she gives us the courage it is our will to survive.

W: I want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind
W: To feel you all around me
W: And to take your hand along the sand
W: Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
W: 
W: When sundown pales the sky
W: I want to hide a while behind your smile
W: And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find
W: For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing
W: T'would make me sing
W: Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
W: When rain has hung the leaves with tears
W: I want you near, to kill my fears
W: To help me to leave all my blues behind
W: Standing in your heart is where I want to be
W: And I long to be
W: Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

W: Under the light of your sweet charms

W: 
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.
W: Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
W: Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
W: Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
W: Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado.
W: 
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.
W: Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
W: Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
W: Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
W: La ruta del alma del que estoy amando.
W: 
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.
W: Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
W: Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
W: Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
W: Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio.
W: 
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.
W: Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
W: Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
W: Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
W: Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros.
W: 
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.
W: Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto.
W: Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
W: Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
W: Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
W: Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto.
W: Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto.

C:Pentangle
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: There lived a lady by the North Sea shore
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: Two daughters were the babes she bore
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: As one grew bright as is the sun
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: So coal black grew the elder one
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: [Verse 3]
W: A knight came riding to the lady's door
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: He'd travelled far to be their wooer
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: He courted one with gloves and rings
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: But he loved the other above all things
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: "Oh sister, will you go with me"
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "To watch the ships sail on the sea?"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 6]
W: She took her sister by the hand
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: And led her down to the North Sea strand
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: You might also like

W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: The dark girl threw her sister o'er
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 8]
W: Sometimes she sank, sometimes she swam
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: Crying, "Sister, reach to me your hand!"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 9]
W: "Oh sister, sister, let me live"
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "And all that's mine I'll surely give"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 10]
W: "Your own true love that I'll have and more"
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "But thou shalt never come ashore"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 11]
W: And there she floated like a swan
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: The salt sea bore her body on
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 12]
W: Two minstrels walked along the strand
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: And saw the maiden float to land
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 13]
W: They've made a harp of her breastbone
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: Whose sound would melt a heart of stone
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 14]
W: They took three locks of her yellow hair
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: And with them strung the harp so rare
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 15]
W: They went into her father's hall
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: To play the harp before them all
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 16]
W: But as they laid it on a stone
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: The harp began to play alone
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 17]
W: The first string sang a doleful sound
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "The bride her younger sister drowned"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 18]
W: The second string as that they tried
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "In terror sits the black-haired bride"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
W: 
W: [Verse 19]
W: The third string sang beneath their bow
W: Lay the bent to the bonnie broom
W: "And surely now her tears will flow"
W: Fa, la-la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

Q: 1/4=100

W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: When God dips His pen of love in my heart
W: And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
W: His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: Well He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: Well sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold
W: And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
W: I go to God in prayer, I can always find Him there
W: To whisper sweet peace to my soul
W: 
W: Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: Well He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
W: When God dips His love in my heart
W: 
W: He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way
W: And gave His life completely to bring a better day
W: My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
W: His blood washed away every stain
W: 
W: I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
W: How He brought salvation and He made me whole
W: But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart
W: He made me laugh and He made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire
W: When God dips His love in my heart

W: Some say the heart is just like a wheel
W: When you bend it you can't mend it
W: But my love for you is like a sinking ship
W: And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean
W: 
W: When harm is done no love can be won
W: I know it happens frequently
W: What I can't understand oh please God hold my hand
W: Why it had to happen to me
W: 
W: And it's only love and it's only love
W: That can wreck a human being and turn him inside out

W: And let me peer inside
W: Let me in where only your thoughts have been
W: Let me occupy your mind as you do mine
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: You have lost too much love
W: To fear, doubt and distrust, it's not enough
W: You just threw away the key to your heart
W: You don't get burned 'cause nothing gets through
W: It makes it easier, easier on you
W: But that much more difficult for me
W: To make you see
W: [Verse 3]
W: Love ain't fair
W: So there you are, my love

W: And you, you can't live like this

W: Love ain't safe, you won't get hurt if you stay chaste
W: So you can wait, but I don't wanna waste my love

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse]
W: There were three brothers in merry Scotland
W: In merry Scotland there were three
W: And they did cast lots which of them should go
W: Should go, should go
W: And turn robber all on the salt sea
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
W: The youngest of all the three
W: That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
W: Salt sea, the salt sea
W: For to maintain his two brothers and he
W: [Verse]
W: He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
W: And a part of a short winter's day
W: When he espied a stout lofty ship
W: Lofty ship, lofty ship
W: Come a-bibbin' down on him straight way
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: "Hello! Hello!" cried Henry Martin
W: "What makes you sail so nigh?
W: I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
W: London Town, London Town
W: Would you please for to let me pass by?"
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: "Oh no! Oh no!" cried Henry Martin
W: "This thing it never could be
W: For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
W: Salt sea, the salt sea
W: For to maintain my two brothers and me"
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizzen
W: Bring your ship under my lee
W: Or I will give to you a full cannonball
W: Cannonball, cannonball
W: And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: Oh no! We won't lower our lofty topsail
W: Nor bring our ship under your lee
W: And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
W: Merchant goods, merchant goods
W: Nor point our bold guns to the sea
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
W: For fully two hours or three
W: Till Henry Martin gave to them the death shot
W: The death shot, the death shot
W: And straight to the bottom went she
W: 
W: [Verse]
W: Bad news, bad news to old England came
W: Bad news to fair London Town
W: There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away
W: Cast away, cast away
W: And all of her merry men drowned

W: [Verse 1]
W: On the first part of the journey
W: I was looking at all the life
W: There were plants and birds and rocks and things
W: There was sand and hills and rings
W: The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
W: And the sky with no clouds
W: The heat was hot and the ground was dry
W: But the air was full of sound
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
W: It felt good to be out of the rain
W: In the desert you can remember your name
W: 'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: [Verse 2]
W: After two days in the desert sun
W: My skin began to turn red
W: After three days in the desert fun
W: I was looking at a river bed
W: And the story it told of a river that flowed
W: Made me sad to think it was dead
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
W: It felt good to be out of the rain
W: In the desert you can remember your name
W: Because there ain't no one for to give you no pain
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: La, la, la lala la la la, la, la
W: 
W: [Instrumental Break]
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: After nine days I let the horse run free
W: 'Cause the desert had turned to sea
W: There were plants and birds and rocks and things
W: There was sand and hills and rings
W: The ocean is a desert with its life underground
W: And a perfect disguise above
W: Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
W: But the humans will give no love
W: You might also like
W: Here

V:1 
"Am"z1z1z1z1"G"z1z1z1z1|
W: Well I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been
W: For three score years in this little isle of green
W: I'm known along the Liffy from the Basin to the Zoo
W: And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
W: For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
W: He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
W: But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo
W: 
W: I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn
W: A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn
W: There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
W: And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo
W: 
W: Who did I waken but the woman of the house
W: With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
W: She began to frighten and I said boo
W: Sure, don't be afraid at all, it's only Johnny Dhu
W: 
W: I met a little girl while a walkin out one day
W: Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say
W: Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
W: With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo
W: 
W: I'll buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
W: And a nice young lady I'll go courting by and by
W: I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them with blue
W: And an old fashioned lady I will make her too
W: 
W: So all along the high road with my bag upon my back
W: Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
W: With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
W: Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo
W: 
W: O I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
W: The fire is all raked and now tis out of light
W: For now you've heard the story of my auld rigadoo
W: So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu

C:Pauline Scanlon
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: We might as well lie down, love
W: Lie down and close our eyes
W: We might as well go walking
W: In the country of the blind
W: The long grass is grown
W: And all the birds flown
W: To their homes away in the blue
W: And nothing's left the same
W: The whole world is changed
W: Since you and I were true
W: And how can a story be ended
W: When it didn't hardly begin?
W: How can my glass be so empty
W: When it's filled up to the brim?
W: And it wasn't always so
W: It didn't always go
W: We had something better to do
W: And it didn't always rain
W: Every single day
W: When you and I were true
W: 
W: In a country where we are headed, love
W: There is nothing but rocks and stones
W: No friendly plant or animal
W: No angel to guide you home
W: Until some day you'll find
W: In the country of the blind
W: Some wonder just like you
W: And the singing of a bird
W: That nobody has heard
W: Since you and I were true
W: 
W: We might as well lie down, love
W: Lie down and close our eyes
W: We might as well go walking
W: In the country of the blind
W: The long grass is grown
W: And all the birds flown
W: To their homes away in the blue
W: And nothing's left the same
W: The whole world is changed

C:Harry McClintock
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: One evening as the sun went down
W: And the jungle fire was burning
W: Down the track came a hobo hikin'
W: And he said, "Boys, I'm not turning
W: I'm headed for a land that's far away
W: Besides the crystal fountains
W: So come with me, we'll go and see
W: The Big Rock Candy Mountains."
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: There's a land that's fair and bright
W: Where the handouts grow on bushes
W: And you sleep out every night
W: Where the boxcars all are empty
W: And the sun shines everyday
W: All the birds and the bees
W: And the cigarette trees
W: The lemonade springs
W: Where the bluebird sings
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: [Verse 3]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: All the cops have wooden legs
W: And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
W: And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
W: The farmers' trees are full of fruit
W: And the barns are full of hay
W: Oh, I'm bound to go
W: Where there ain't no snow
W: Where the rain don't fall
W: The wind don't blow
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: You never change your socks
W: And the little streams of alcohol
W: Come trickling down the rocks
W: The brakemen have to tip their hats
W: And the railroad bulls are blind
W: There's a lake of stew
W: And of whiskey too
W: You can paddle all around them
W: In a big canoe
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: The jails are made of tin
W: And you can walk right out again
W: As soon as you are in
W: There ain't no short-handled shovels
W: No axes, saws, or picks
W: I'm going to stay
W: Where you sleep all day
W: Where they hung the Turk
W: That invented work
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
W: 
W: I'll see you all this coming fall
W: In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Somewhere out west a freighter rides by
W: You used to watch them pass with their grit in your eye
W: And the wild dogs under darkening sky
W: Still listen for your lonesome lullaby
W: 
W: Way out in the desert you felt so free
W: How you loved those hills of Joshua Tree
W: Now there's a dusty path missing two dusty feet
W: Is this really how you wanted it to be
W: 
W: Everybody said you won't make it
W: Everybody said you're no good
W: But did you listen to them, in the end
W: Even though you swore you never would
W: The patch of ground where they found you that day
W: Is godforsaken, a barren place
W: Why did you have to go this way
W: Why did you go this way

C:Tim O'Brien
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One evening for pleasure I rambled
W: On the banks of some cold purling stream
W: I set down on a bed of primroses
W: And I gently fell into a dream
W: I dreamt that I saw a fair female
W: Her equal I never saw before
W: And I sighed for the laws of our country
W: As we stray there on Ireland?s green shore
W: 
W: Her cheeks were like two bloomin? roses
W: Her teeth were like ivory so white
W: Her eyes shone like two sparkling diamonds
W: Or the stars on some cold frosty night
W: She was dressed in the richist attire
W: And green was the mantle she wore
W: All bound down with the hemlocks and the roses
W: As we stray there on Ireland?s green shore
W: Transgression of joy I awoken
W: I found this was only a dream
W: That pretty fair female had fled me
W: I longed to be slumbering again
W: May the heavens above be her guardian
W: Though I know I?ll never see her anymore
W: May the goldliest sunbeam shine upon her
W: As she lies sleeping on Ireland?s green shore
W: 
W: One evening for pleasure I rambled
W: On the banks of some cold purling stream
W: I set down on a bed of primroses
W: And I gently fell into a dream

Q: 1/4=100

W: I scare myself just thinking about you
W: I scare myself when I'm without you
W: I scare myself, the moment that you're gone
W: I scare myself when I let my thoughts run
W: 
W: And when they're running
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And when they're running
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: I scare myself and I don't mean lightly
W: I scare myself, it can get frightening
W: I scare myself to think what I could do
W: I scare myself, it's some kind of voodoo
W: 
W: And with that voodoo
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And with that voodoo
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: And with that voodoo
W: I keep thinking of you
W: And with that voodoo
W: What can I do?
W: 
W: But it's so, so very different when we're together
W: And I'm so, so, so much calmer, I feel better
W: 'Cause the stars already crossed our paths forever
W: And the sooner that we realize it, the better
W: 
W: And then I'll be with you and I won't scare myself
W: And I'll know what to do and I won't scare myself
W: And my thoughts will run and I won't scare myself
W: And I'll think of you and I won't scare myself

W: Welcome, strangers, to the show
W: I'm the one who should be lying low
W: Saw the knives out, turned my back
W: Heard the train coming, stayed out on the track
W: In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
W: I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
W: I've done all the dumb things
W: 
W: Caught the fever, heard the tune
W: Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon

W:

W: It doesn't stop me from going through these things twice
W: I see the knives out, I turn my back

W: In the middle, in the middle, in the middle of a dream
W: I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
W: I've done all the dumb things

W: It was on one bright March morning
W: I bid New Orleans adieu.
W: And I took the road to Jackson town,
W: My fortune to renew,
W: I cursed all foreign money,
W: No credit could I gain,
W: Which filled my heart with longing for
W: The lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I stepped on board a railroad car,
W: Beneath the morning sun,
W: I road the roads till evening,
W: And I laid me down again,
W: All strangers there no friends to me,
W: Till a dark girl towards me came,
W: And I fell in love with a Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I said, "My pretty Creole girl,
W: My money here's no good,
W: But if it weren't for the alligators,
W: I'd sleep out in the wood".
W: "You're welcome here kind stranger,
W: Our house is very plain.
W: But we never turn a stranger out,
W: From the lakes of Pontchartrain."
W: 
W: She took me into her mammy's house,
W: And treated me quite well,
W: The hair upon her shoulder
W: In jet black ringlets fell.
W: To try and paint her beauty,
W: I'm sure it would be in vain,
W: So handsome was my Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: I asked her if she'd marry me,
W: She said it could never be,
W: For she had got another,
W: And he was far at sea.
W: She said that she would wait for him
W: And true she would remain.
W: Till he returned for his Creole girl,
W: By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
W: 
W: So fare thee well my Creole girl,
W: I never will see you no more,
W: But I'll ne'er forget your kindness
W: In the cottage by the shore.
W: And at each social gathering
W: A flowing glass I'll raise,
W: And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl,
W: And the lakes of Pontchartrain.

W: But he can't help it if you capsize
W: He'll light your way but that is all
W: Steer your own ship back to shore

W: This sea is full of misery and woe
W: Oh woe betide those that say
W: They don't need no light to light their way

W: Drown in murky depths below
W:

W: How many sorrows
W: Do you try to hide
W: In a world of illusion

W: The miracle of love
W: Will take away your pain
W: When the miracle of love
W: Comes your way again.
W: 
W: Cruel is the night
W: That covers up your fears.
W: Tender is the one
W: That wipes away your tears.
W: There must be a bitter breeze
W: To make you sting so viciously -
W: They say the greatest coward
W: Can hurt the most ferociously.
W: But I'll show you something good.
W: Oh I'll show you something good.
W: If you open your heart
W: You can make a new start
W: When your crumbling world falls apart.

W: [Verse 1]
W: Six years I've been in the city
W: And every night I dream of the sea
W: They say home is where you find it
W: Will this place ever satisfy me?

W: My island home is waiting for me
W: [Verse 2]
W: In the evening the dry wind blows
W: From the hills and across the plains
W: I close my eyes and I'm standing
W: In a boat on the sea again
W: And I'm holding that long turtle spear
W: And I feel I'm close now to where it must be
W: My island home is waiting for me

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: This is my least favorite life
W: The one where you fly and I don’t
W: A kiss holds a million deceits
W: And a lifetime goes up in smoke
W: This is my least favorite you
W: Who floats far above earth and stone
W: The nights that I twist on the rack
W: Is the time that I feel most at home
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We're wandering in the shade
W: And the rustle of fallen leaves
W: A bird on the edge of a blade
W: Lost now forever, my love, in a sweet memory
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: The station pulls away from the train
W: The blue pulls away from the sky
W: The whisper of two broken wings
W: Maybe they’re yours, maybe they’re mine
W: This is my least favorite life
W: The one where I am out of my mind
W: The one where you are just out of reach
W: The one where I stay and you fly
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm wandering in the shade
W: And the rustle of fallen leaves
W: A bird on the edge of the blade
W: Lost now forever, my love, in a sweet memory

T: Ode To Billy Joe
C:Bobbie Gentry
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
W: I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
W: And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
W: And Mama hollered out the back door, "Y'all, remember to wipe your feet!"
W: And then she said, "I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
W: Today, Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: And Papa said to Mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
W: "Well, Billie Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
W: There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow"
W: And Mama said it was shame about Billie Joe, anyhow
W: Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And now Billie Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
W: [Verse 3]
W: And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
W: Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
W: And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
W: "I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
W: I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
W: And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Mama said to me, "Child, what's happened to your appetite?
W: I've been cookin' all mornin', and you haven't touched a single bite
W: That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
W: Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
W: He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And she and Billie Joe was throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge"
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe
W: And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
W: There was a virus going 'round; Papa caught it, and he died last spring
W: And now Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
W: And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
W: And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge

T: On Children
C:Kahlil Gibran
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Your children are not your children.
W: They are the sons and daughters of Life’s longing for itself.
W: They come through you but not from you,
W: And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
W: 
W: You may give them your love but not your thoughts,
W: For they have their own thoughts.
W: You may house their bodies but not their souls,
W: For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
W: You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
W: For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
W: You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
W: The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
W: Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
W: For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

T: Psychotherapy
C:Melanie Safka
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Oh mine eyes have seen the glory of the theories of Freud,
W: He has taught me all the evils that my ego must avoid.
W: Repression of the impulses resuling paranoid
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: There was a man who thought his friends to him were all superior
W: And this complex he imagined made life drearier and drearier
W: Till his analyst assured him that he really was inferior
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Do you drown your superego in a flood of alcohol - or something else -
W: And go running after women till you're just about to fall.
W: You may think you're having fun but you're not having fun at all
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Oh sad is the masochism, the vagaries of sex
W: Have turned half the population into total nervous wrecks.
W: But your analyst will cure you, long as you can pay the cheques
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Is your body plagued by aches and pains that you can't understand
W: Compound fractures ingrown toenails, floating kidneys, trembling hands,
W: There's a secret to your trouble: you're in love with your old man
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on
W: 
W: Freud's mystic world of meaning needn't have us mystified
W: It's really very simple what the psyche tries to hide:
W: A thing is a phallic symbol if it's longer than it's wide
W: As the id goes marching on.
W: Glory glory psychotherapy, glory glory sexuality,
W: Glory glory now we can be free as the id goes marching on.

W: Scratching at my door
W: But I cut my hands
W: And break my back
W: Draggin' this bag of stones
W: Till they bury me down, beneath the ground
W: With the dust and rattlin' bones
W: 
W: [Shane] Left my home and left my love
W: [Kasey] Caught on a rusty nail
W: [Shane] Devil rose up, heavy with gold
W: [Kasey] My soul's not for sale
W: [Shane] Then a holy man in a house of God
W: [Kasey] He offered me a book of prayer
W: [Shane] And when I left my home I left my love
W: [Both] I left my faith back there
W: 
W: Smoke don't rise

W: Till they bury me down, beneath the ground
W: With the dust and rattlin' bones
W: 
W: [Shane] Shuttin' my eyes and hang my head
W: [Kasey] Darkness makes no sound
W: [Shane] Climb it up, bottom there
W: [Kasey] Earth's on the way back down
W: [Shane] When a sadness falls on the morning bird
W: [Kasey] Wonder what the day will bring
W: [Shane] But I'm shuttin' my eyes and hang my head
W: [Both] At least that bird can sing

Q: 1/4=100

W: Where am I today? I wish that I knew
W: Cause lookin' around there's no sign of you
W: I don't remember one jump or one leap
W: Just quiet steps away from your lead
W: 
W: I'm holding my heart out but clutching it too
W: Feeling this short of a love that we once knew
W: Calling this a home when it's not even close
W: I'm playing the role with nerves left exposed
W: 
W: Standing on a darkened stage
W: Stumbling through the lines
W: Others have excuses
W: I have my reasons why
W: We get distracted by the dreams of our own
W: But nobody's happy while feeling alone
W: And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall
W: We lean another ladder against the wrong wall
W: 
W: And climb high to the highest rung
W: To shake fists at the sky
W: Others have excuses
W: I have my reasons why
W: With so much deception
W: It's hard not to wander away
W: It's hard not to wander away, it's hard not to wander away

V:1 
W: He left a card
W: A bar of soap and a scrubbing brush next to a note that said
W: Use these down to your bones
W: 
W: And before I knew I had shiny skin
W: And it felt easy being clean like him
W: I thought this one knows better than I do
W: 
W: A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
W: He tried to cut me so I'd fit
W: 
W: And doesn't that sound familiar
W: Doesn't that hit too close to home
W: Doesn't that make you shiver
W: The way things could have gone
W: 
W: And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
W: So that I do remember to never go that far
W: Could you leave me with a scar
W: 
W: So the next one came with a bag of treats
W: She smelt like sugar and spoke like the sea
W: She told me, "Don't trust them
W: Trust me"
W: 
W: Then she pulled at my stitches one by one
W: Looked at my insides
W: Clicking her tongue and said, "This will all have to come undone"
W: 
W: A triangle trying to squeeze through a circle
W: She tried to blunt me so I'd fit
W: 
W: And doesn't that sound familiar
W: Doesn't that hit too close to home
W: Doesn't that make you shiver
W: The way things could have gone
W: 
W: And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
W: So that I do remember to never go that far
W: Could you leave me with a scar
W: 
W: I think I realised just in time
W: Although my old self was hard to find
W: You can bathe me in your finest wine but I'll never give you mine
W: 'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be the bad fruit nobody buys
W: Tell me did you think we'd all dream the same
W: 
W: And doesn't that sound familiar
W: Doesn't that hit too close to home
W: Doesn't that make you shiver
W: The way things could have gone
W: 
W: And doesn't it feel peculiar when everyone wants a little more
W: So that I do remember to never go that far
W: Could you leave me with a scar
W: Could you leave me with a scar

F#|A|E B
W: [Verse 1]
W: You wait in the car on the side of the road
W: Let me go and stand awhile
W: I want to know you're there, but I wanna be alone
W: If only for a minute or two
W: I wanna see what it feels like to be without you
W: I wanna know the touch of my own skin
W: Against the sun, against the wind
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: I walked out in a field, the grass was high
W: It brushed against my legs
W: I just stood and looked out at the open space
W: And a farmhouse out aways
W: And I wondered about the people who lived in it
W: And I wondered if they were happy and content
W: Were there children and a man and a wife?
W: Did she love him and take her hair down at night?
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: If I stray away too far from you
W: Don't go and try to find me
W: It doesn't mean I don't love you
W: It doesn't mean I won't come back and stay beside you
W: It only means I need a little time
W: To follow that unbroken line
W: To a place where the wild things grow
W: To a place where I used to always go
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la
W: La la la la, la la la, la la la, la la la

W: I wanna know the touch of my own skin

C:The Audreys
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: If there’s one thing that I’ve noticed
W: Out of all the things I’ve seen
W: It’s that you can leave a footprint
W: In a place you’ve never been
W: And there’s barely time to look around
W: Before you have to leave
W: And a mark upon the skin
W: Is not enough to make you bleed
W: If there’s one thing that I’m keeping
W: Out of all the things I’ve found
W: It’s that the best way to be heard sometimes
W: Is not to make a sound
W: And the things we want the most
W: Fetch not a penny nor a pound
W: And all it takes to find your feet
W: Is just to stand your ground
W: If there’s one thing that I’m sure of
W: Out of all the things I know
W: It’s that you can keep on going fast
W: I’ll still be going slow
W: And falling’s not that hard
W: When you’re starting out so low
W: And drowning’s not that bad
W: If you breathe and just let go
W: Breathe and just let go…
W: (the wasted and the used things
W: The broken and abused things
W: All these small things
W: The treasured and the sacred things
W: The lost and the forsaken things
W: All these small things)

Q: 1/4=100

W: Shaking hands and fingers that do tremble
W: Soldier's joy has been a bitter pill
W: Though in battle a brave man I resemble
W: Alone, I am a coward without will
W: 
W: Here's McGee from the great state of Missouri
W: To the ?Show-Me State Militia? I belong
W: And to judge from the pride on the Confederate side
W: I'd say five hundred thousand rebels can't be wrong
W: 
W: A rebel stand is no place for a traitor
W: A loveless union cannot bend us to her will
W: Cannot command the soldiers who now hate her
W: Nor demand a bounty of her generals
W: 
W: I took a rifle ball in my shoulder
W: But my entire body filled with pain
W: I waited with them all at the field hospital
W: Oh God, another shot of morphine
W: 
W: Soldier's joy, oh, what's the point in pleasure
W: When it's only meant to kill the pain?
W: Lay down my arms and take the coffin's measure
W: Or take up arms and send me out to fight again
W: 
W: Shaking hands, was I a coward, was I brave?
W: Shaking hands, I took the bitter pill
W: Tell the story on my grave, my soul they could not save
W: What the bullet could not kill, the needle will

W: [Verse 1]
W: I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
W: I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
W: All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
W: And disregards the rest, hmm
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
W: In the company of strangers
W: In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
W: Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
W: Looking for the places only they would know

W: Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

W: I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
W: I took some comfort there, la la la la la la la
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Now the years are rolling by me
W: They are rockin' evenly
W: I am older than I once was
W: And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
W: Nor is it strange
W: After changes upon changes
W: We are more or less the same
W: After changes we are more or less the same

W: I'll tell a story, paint
W: 
W: you a picture from my past.

W: 
W: And the waves crashing around

W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: 
W: She'd had to leave us, my keeper
W: 
W: he prayed for a safe return.
W: But when the night came, the weather
W: to a raging storm had turned.
W: 
W: He watched her ship fight, but in vain
W: against the wild and terrible wave.
W: In me so helpless, as dashed
W: against the rock she met her end.
W: 
W: And the waves crashing around
W: 
W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: 
W: Then on the next day, my keeper
W: found her washed up on the SHORE.
W: He kissed her cold face, that
W: they'd be together soon he'd swore.
W: 
W: I saw him crying, watched as
W: he buried her in the sand.
W: And then he climbed my tower, and
W: off of the edge of me he ran.
W: 
W: And the waves crashing around
W: 
W: me, the sand slips out to sea.
W: And the winds that blow remind me, of
W: what has been, and what can never be.
W: 
W: I am a lighthouse, worn by
W: 
W: the weather and the waves.
W: And though I am empty, I still

W: I think I hear the sounds of then and people talking
W: The scenes recalled by minute movement
W: And songs they fall from the backing tape
W: That certain texture, that certain smell
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: To lie in sweat on familiar sheets
W: In brick veneer on financed beds
W: In a room of silent HardieFlex
W: That certain texture, that certain smell
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: Brings home the heavy days
W: Brings home the the nighttime swell
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Out on the patio we'd sit
W: And the humidity we'd breathe
W: We'd watch the lightning crack over cane-fields
W: And laugh and think, "This is Australia"
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: The block is awkward, it faces west
W: Long diagonals and sloping, too
W: And in the distance, through the heat haze
W: In convoys of silence the cattle graze
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: That certain texture, that certain beat
W: Brings forth the nighttime heat
W: Cha-kow

C:Susan Vega
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Verse 1]
W: I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
W: I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
W: And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
W: He is looking out the window at somebody coming in
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: "It is always nice to see you," says the man behind the counter
W: To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
W: And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
W: And I'm pretending not to see them, and instead I pour the milk
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I open up the paper, there's a story of an actor
W: Who had died while he was drinking, it was no one I had heard of
W: And I'm turning to the horoscope and looking for the funnies
W: When I'm feeling someone watching me and so I raise my head
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: There's a woman on the outside looking inside, does she see me?
W: No, she does not really see me 'cause she sees her own reflection
W: And I'm trying not to notice that she's hitching up her skirt
W: And while she's straightening her stockings, her hair has gotten wet
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: Oh, this rain, it will continue through the morning as I'm listening
W: To the bells of the cathedral
W: I am thinking of your voice
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: 
W: [Verse 6]
W: And of the midnight picnic once upon a time before the rain began
W: And I finish up my coffee
W: And it's time to catch the train
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
W: Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

W: There's a chance that I may
W: Have to stand back and watch you find
W: Your own weaving way
W: It's not the way you talk
W: That's making me grieve
W: It's not the way you walk
W: It's the way that you weave
W: 
W: It's eating you inside
W: And tossed out like a bone
W: Leaving you to find your weaving way home
W: The sun on the horizon
W: Was turning dawn to day
W: By the time you finally found your own weaving way
W: Oh, I love the way you laugh
W: When I ask you to leave
W: I swear that I don't love you for the way that you weave
W: 
W: Forgive me, my friend
W: Did I forget to mention?
W: The path that you have chosen
W: Is paved with your intentions
W: Touch a finger to your nose
W: I wish you well
W: Walk a straight line on the road to hell

W: You got to leave me now, you got to go alone
W: You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own
W: Before it slips away
W: 
W: When you're flyin' high, take my heart along

W: That you learn to play
W: 
W: [Chorus 1: Thile, Sara Watkins & Sean Watkins/Thile]
W: When you're soarin' through the air
W: I'll be your solid ground
W: Take every chance you dare
W: I'll still be there
W: When you come back down
W: When you come back down
W: [Verse 2: Thile]
W: I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return
W: My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn
W: And I won't feel your fire
W: 
W: I'll be the other hand that always holds the line
W: Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine
W: I'm strung out on that wire
W: 
W: [Chorus 2: Thile, Sara Watkins & Sean Watkins/Thile]
W: And I'll be on the other end
W: To hear you when you call
W: Angel, you were born to fly
W: And if you get too high
W: I'll catch you when you fall
W: I'll catch you when you fall

W: [Intro]
W: Who's that girl?
W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: The language of love slips from my lover's tongue
W: Cooler than ice cream and warmer than the sun
W: Dumb hearts get broken just like china cups
W: The language of love has left me broken on the rocks
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: But there's just one thing (Ah)
W: Just one thing (Hey)
W: But there's just one thing (Oh, yeah)
W: And I really wanna know
W: [Chorus]
W: Who's that girl running around with you?
W: Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
W: Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
W: Tell me, who's that girl?
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: The language of love has left me stony grey
W: Tongue tied and twisted at the price I've had to pay
W: Your careless notions have silenced these emotions
W: Look at all the foolishness your lover's talk has done
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Who's that girl running around with you?
W: Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
W: Tell me, who's that girl?

W: [Intro]
W: Why?
W: Why?
W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: How many times do I have to try to tell you
W: That I'm sorry for the things I've done?
W: But when I start to try to tell you
W: That's when you have to tell me
W: "Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun"
W: I tell myself too many times
W: Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
W: That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
W: That keep on falling from your mouth
W: Falling from your mouth
W: Falling from your mouth
W: [Chorus]
W: Tell me
W: Why?
W: Why?
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: I may be mad
W: I may be blind
W: I may be viciously unkind
W: But I can still read what you're thinking
W: And I've heard it said too many times
W: That you'd be better off
W: Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
W: This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
W: Let's go down to the water's edge
W: And we can cast away those doubts
W: Some things are better left unsaid
W: But they still turn me inside out
W: Turning inside out
W: Turning inside out
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Tell me
W: Why?
W: Tell me
W: Why?
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: (Why?) This is the book I never read
W: These are the words I never said
W: This is the path I'll never tread
W: These are the dreams I'll dream instead
W: (Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
W: These are the tears, the tears we shed
W: This is the fear, this is the dread
W: These are the contents of my head
W: (Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
W: And this is what they represent
W: And this is how I feel
W: Do you know how I feel?
W: ‘Cause I don't think you know how I feel
W: I don't think you know what I fear
W: (Why?) I don't think you know what I fear
W: You don't know what I fear

W: There was a Wild Colonial Boy, Jack Duggan was his name
W: He was born and raised in Ireland, in a place called Castlemain
W: He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
W: And dearly did his parents love, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: At the early age of eighteen years, he left his native home
W: And to Australia's sunny shore, he was inclined to roam
W: He robbed the rich, to help the poor, he shot Judge McEvoy
W: A terror to Australia was, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: One morning on the prairie, as Jack he rode along
W: A listening to the mocking bird, singing a cheerful song
W: Up rode three mounted troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
W: They all set out to capture him, the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: Surrender now, Jack Duggan, for you see we're three to one
W: Surrender in the Queen's high name, you are a plundering son
W: Jack drew two pistols from his belt and proudly waved them high
W: "I'll fight but not surrender, " said the Wild Colonial Boy
W: 
W: He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
W: And turning round to Davis, he received a mortal wound
W: A bullet pierced his proud young heart, from the pistol of Fitzroy
W: And that was how they captured him, the Wild Colonial Boy

W: Billion year old carbon

W: Caught in the devil's bargain
W: And we've got to get ourselves

W: A man walks down the street
W: He says, "Why am I soft in the middle, now?
W: Why am I soft in the middle?
W: The rest of my life is so hard
W: I need a photo-opportunity

W: I can be your long lost pal
W: I can call you Betty
W: And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al
W:

W: He says, "Why am I short of attention?
W: Got a short little span of attention
W: And, whoa, my nights are so long
W: Where's my wife and family?
W: What if I die here?
W: Who'll be my role model
W: Now that my role model is gone, gone?"
W: He ducked back down the alley
W: With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl
W: All along, along
W: There were incidents and accidents
W: There were hints and allegations

W: [Chorus]
W: If you'll be my bodyguard

W: It's a street in a strange world
W: Maybe it's the third world
W: Maybe it's his first time around
W: Doesn't speak the language
W: He holds no currency
W: He is a foreign man
W: He is surrounded by the sound, the sound
W: Cattle in the marketplace
W: Scatterlings and orphanages
W: He looks around, around
W: He sees angels in the architecture
W: Spinning in infinity
W: He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!"

T: Swinging On A Star
C:Johnny Burke
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: [Chorus: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: Would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are (Ooo)
W: Or would you rather be a mule?
W: 
W: [Verse 1: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A mule is an animal with long funny ears
W: He kicks up at anything he hears
W: His back is brawny but his brain is weak
W: He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
W: And by the way, if you hate to go to school
W: You may grow up to be a mule
W: [Chorus 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: Or would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are, doo doo
W: Or would you rather be a pig?
W: 
W: [Verse 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
W: His shoes are a terrible disgrace
W: He has no manners when he eats his food
W: He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
W: But if you don't care a feather or a fig
W: You may grow up to be a pig
W: 
W: [Chorus 3: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: Or would you like to swing on a star
W: Carry moonbeams home in a jar
W: And be better off than you are
W: Or would you rather be a fish?
W: 
W: [Verse 3: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
W: He can't write his name or read a book
W: To fool the people is his only thought
W: And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
W: But then if that sort of life is what you wish
W: You may grow up to be a fish
W: You might also like
W: The Day After Forever
W: Bing Crosby
W: Going My Way
W: Bing Crosby
W: White Christmas
W: Bing Crosby
W: A new kind of jumped up slippery fish
W: 
W: [Outro: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
W: And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
W: Everyday you'll meet quite a few
W: So you see it's all up to you (Ooo)
W: You can be better than you are (Ooo)
W: You could be swingin' on a star
W: 
W: Doo doo doo doo doo
W: Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo

W: Walking along the banks of a river
W: Starts out narrow and ends up so wide
W: Somewhere along you will find the right step-stones
W: Sooner or later you’ll cross to the other side
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea
W: In between so much twisting and turning
W: Winding its way until it runs free
W: 
W: I don’t know where I’m going but I know how I’ll get there
W: I’ll follow the laughing water all the way down
W: I’ll build me a boat and I’ll float down the middle
W: Just let the current take me where I’m bound
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea
W: In between so much twisting and turning
W: Winding its way until it runs free

W: 
W: I left a friend back there on the mountain
W: Made a new friend on this long and winding stream
W: The water is wise so just let it take you
W: Just let it take you into your dream
W: 
W: When I was younger I asked lots of questions
W: I asked and I asked but no one seemed to hear
W: But I was the one who should have been listening
W: Now I know I have nothing to fear
W: 
W: River starts way up in the mountains
W: Slowly falls all the way to the sea

W: Hey mama, when you leave, don't leave a thing behind
W: I don't want nothing, I can't use nothing
W: Take care into the hall and if you see my friends
W: Tell 'em I'm fine, not using nothing
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Almost burned out my eyes and threw my ears down to the floor
W: I didn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing
W: I stood there like a block of stone knowing all I had to know
W: And nothing more, man, that's nothing
W: [Verse 3]
W: 'Cause, brothers, our troubles are locked in each others arms
W: And you better pray that they never find you
W: 'Cause your back ain't strong enough for burdens double fold
W: They'd crush you down, down into nothing
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Being born is going blind and bowing down a thousand times
W: To echoes strung on pure temptation
W: Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things
W: And the only words that are worth remembering

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Well I'll be damned
W: Here comes your ghost again
W: But that's not unusual
W: It's just that the moon is full
W: And you happened to call
W: And here I sit
W: Hand on the telephone
W: Hearing a voice I'd known
W: A couple of light years ago
W: Heading straight for a fall
W: As I remember your eyes
W: Were bluer than robin's eggs
W: My poetry was lousy you said
W: Where are you calling from?
W: A booth in the midwest
W: Ten years ago
W: I bought you some cufflinks
W: You brought me something
W: We both know what memories can bring
W: They bring diamonds and rust
W: 
W: Well you burst on the scene
W: Already a legend
W: The unwashed phenomenon
W: The original vagabond
W: You strayed into my arms
W: And there you stayed
W: Temporarily lost at sea
W: The Madonna was yours for free
W: Yes the girl on the half-shell
W: Would keep you unharmed
W: 
W: Now I see you standing
W: With brown leaves falling around
W: And snow in your hair
W: Now you're smiling out the window
W: Of that crummy hotel
W: Over Washington Square
W: Our breath comes out white clouds
W: Mingles and hangs in the air
W: Speaking strictly for me
W: We both could have died then and there
W: 
W: Now you're telling me
W: You're not nostalgic
W: Then give me another word for it
W: You who are so good with words
W: And at keeping things vague
W: Because I need some of that vagueness now
W: It's all come back too clearly
W: Yes I loved you dearly
W: And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
W: I've already paid

W: Where women glow and men plunder
W: Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
W: You better run, you better take cover."

W: He was six foot four and full of muscle
W: I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"

W: Where beer does flow and men chunder
W: Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder

W: Lying in a den in Bombay
W: With a slack jaw, and not much to say
W: I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
W: Because I come from the land of plenty."

W: Where women glow and men plunder

W: Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
W: Sailing a reach before a following sea
W: She was making for the trades on the outside
W: And the downhill run to Papeete
W: Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas
W: We got eighty feet of the waterline
W: Nicely making way
W: In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
W: But on a midnight watch I realized
W: Why twice you ran away
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: (I think about)
W: Think about how many times I have fallen
W: Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
W: What heaven brought you and me
W: Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I have been around the world (Looking)
W: Looking for that woman-girl
W: (And I know she knows)
W: Who knows love can endure
W: And you know it will
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
W: You understand now why you came this way
W: 'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
W: But it's as big as the promise
W: The promise of a coming day
W: So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying
W: And my love is an anchor tied to you
W: Tied with a silver chain
W: I have my ship
W: And all her flags are a-flying
W: She is all that I have left
W: And music is her name
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: (I think about)
W: Think about how many times I have fallen
W: Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
W: What heaven brought you and me
W: Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I have been around the world (Looking)
W: Looking for that woman-girl
W: Who knows love can endure
W: And you know it will
W: And you know it will
W: (Yes)
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: So we cheated and we lied and we tested
W: And we never failed to fail
W: It was the easiest thing to do
W: You will survive being bested
W: Somebody fine
W: Will come along, make me forget about loving you
W: In the Southern Cross

W: You've been hiding from the start
W: Did some lover steal your heart
W: Or did the full moon make you mad?
W: 
W: Oh, captain why these speechless seas
W: That never come to land?
W: Oh, I need to understand
W: Could a little light be that bad?
W: 
W: I can see your hands are roughened
W: By the wheel and the rope
W: I'd like to look to you for hope

W: Awaiting bombers in the night
W: Oh, you hold your helm so tight
W: And yet the sky seems so fair

W: Who guides this ship
W: Dreaming through the seas
W: Turning and searching

W: Like yours, m'lady, like yours
W: She'd walk down through the garden
W: In the morning after it rained
W: Peacocks wandered aimlessly
W: Underneath an orange tree
W: Why can't she see me?

W: Down the slope to the harbor where I lay
W: Anchored for a day

W: [Verse 3]
W: Guinnevere had golden hair
W: Like yours, m'lady, like yours
W: Streaming out when we'd ride
W: Through the warm wind down by the bay
W: Yesterday
W: Seagulls circle endlessly
W: I sing in silent harmony
W: We shall be free

W: And so become yourself
W: Because the past is just a good-bye

W: If they told you, you would cry
W: So just look at them and sigh
W: And know they love you
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: And you of tender years (Can you hear and do you care)
W: Can't know the fears (And can you see)
W: That your elders grew by (We must be free)
W: And so please help (To teach your children)
W: Them with your youth (What you believe in)
W: They seek the truth (Make a world)
W: Before they can die (That we can live in)
W:

W: Teach your parents well

W: You're from the other side
W: There's just one thing I got to know
W: Can you tell me please, who won?

W: Slowed in midfall to the streams
W: Of fast running rivers  of choice and chance  and time stops here
W: 
W: On the delta
W: While they dance  while they dance
W: 
W: I love the child  who steers this riverboat
W: But lately he's crazy  for the deep
W: The river seems dreamlike in the daytime
W: Someone keeps thinking in my sleep

W: On the delta

W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: One morning I woke up and I knew you were really gone
W: A new day, a new way and new eyes to see the dawn
W: Go your way, I'll go mine and carry on
W: 
W: The sky is clearing and the night has cried enough
W: The sun, he come, the world to soften up
W: Rejoice, rejoice, we have no choice but to carry on

W: Love is coming
W: Love is coming to us all
W: 
W: Where are you going now my love? where will you be tomorrow?
W: Will you bring me happiness? will you bring me sorrow?
W: Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
W: Lover can you talk to me?
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: (same as verse 1)
W: 
W: Girl when I was on my own, chasing you down
W: What was it made you run? trying your best just to get around.
W: The questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
W: Lover can you talk to me?

W: [Intro]
W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: Look at those dancers gliding around
W: Seems as is their feet
W: Don't hardly touch the ground
W: 
W: Look at them smiling Like they knew one another
W: And they never
W: would come down
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Turn around and hold me
W: I'd like to see your face alone
W: I'm hoping there's someone home
W: 
W: [Interlude]
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: I'd like to meet you Who do you see?
W: Introduce yourself to whichever of me
W: is nearby
W: 
W: Close behind your eyes you're laughing at me
W: And I'm stuck with no instructions that I can see
W: To steer by
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Stick around it's tricky ground
W: I'd like to see your face alone
W: I'm hoping there's someone home
W: 
W: [Interlude]
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Two or three people fading in and out
W: Like a radio station that I'm thinking about
W: But I can't hear
W: 
W: Who gets breakfast? Who gets the lunch?
W: Who gets to be the boss of this bunch?
W: Who will steer?
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Turning Turning
W: To see your face alone
W: I'm hoping there's someone home
W: 
W: [Interlude]
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: Dream
W: Do you dream
W: Dreaming
W: Do you?
W: Dream
W: Do you dream
W: Dreaming
W: Do you?
W: 
W: [Outro]
W: In my dreams
W: I can see I can
W: I can see a love
W: That could be ...

W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: Six o'clock...    in the morning, I feel pretty good,
W: So I dropped in - to the luxury of The Lords...
W: ...Fighting dragons, and crossing swords...   with the people,
W: A - gainst the hordes who came to conquer!      |  /  /   /  / |
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Seven o'clock       ...in the morning,
W: Here it comes,  I taste the warning,
W: And I am so amazed I'm here today,
W: Seeing things so clear this way,
W: In the car, and on my way to Stonehenge!     |  /  /  /  /  |
W:

W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I'm flying in Win - chester Cath - edral,
W: Sunlight pouring through the break of day,
W: Stumbled through the door, and into the cham-------ber!
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: There's a lady setting flowers on a table covered lace,
W: And a cleaner in the distance finds a cobweb on a face,
W: And a feeling, deep inside of me,
W: Tells me this can't be... the place!        |  /  /  /  /  |
W: 
W: [Verse 5]
W: I'm flying in Win - chester Cath - edral,
W: All re - ligion has to have it's day--------,
W: Ex - pressions on the face of the sav------iour,
W: Made me say-----,        'I can't stay----!'
W: 
W: [Verse 6]
W: Open up the gates of the church, and let me out of here,
W: Too many people have lied in the name of Christ,
W: For anyone to heed the call,
W: So many people have died in the name of Christ,
W: That I can't believe it all!
W: 
W: [Verse 7]
W: Now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799,
W: And the day he died it was a birthday,
W: And I noticed it was mine,
W: And my head didn't know just who I was,
W: And I went spinning back in time!
W: 
W: [Verse 8]
W: And I am high upon the alter, high----  upon the alter,

W: 
W: [Verse 9]
W: I'm flying in Win - chester Cath - edral,
W: It's hard enough to drink the wine,
W: The air inside just hangs in delusion,
W: But given time-----,       I'll be fine----!
W: 
W: [Verse 10]
W: Open up the gates of the church, and let me out of here,
W: Too many people have lied in the name of Christ,

W: [intro]
W: 
W: [verse 1]
W: Forgive me if my fantasies might seem a little shopworn
W: I'm sure you've heard it all before  I wonder what's the right form
W: Love songs written for you  it's been going down for years
W: But to sing what's in my heart seems more honest than the tears
W: 
W: [pre-chorus]
W: I am curious,  Don't want to hurry us,
W: I'm intrigued with us,   Ain't this song a bust
W: I don't care,   Dark star
W: 
W: [verse 2]
W: I met you several years ago
W: The times they were so strange but I had a feeling
W: You looked into my eyes just once
W: An instant flashing by that we were stealing
W: Another time you felt so bad
W: And I wasn't any help at all as I recall
W: We didn't know quite what to do
W: So we left the wanting be still there for me and you
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: Dark star,   I see you in the morning
W: Dark star,   a-sleeping next to me
W: Dark star,   let the memory of the evening
W: Be the first thing that you think of when you
W: Open up your smile and see me,  Dark star
W: 
W: [verse 3]
W: It's easy to be with you
W: Even with the storms that rage beneath your search for peace
W: We must make some time together
W: Take the kids and find a world that's ours to keep
W: Now you've got me dreaming girl
W: It's been so long I thought that I'd forgotten how
W: My heart is once again my soul
W: We touched we did you know we did no more teasing now
W: 
W: [chorus]
W: Dark star,   I see you in the morning
W: Dark star,   a-sleeping next to me
W: Dark star,   let the memory of the evening
W: Be the first thing that you think of when you
W: Open up your smile and see me,  Dark star

W: [outro]
W: Let the memory of the evening

W: [Verse 1]
W: Four and twenty years ago I come into this life
W: The son of a woman and a man who lived in strife
W: He was tired of being poor
W: And he wasn't into selling door to door
W: And he worked like the devil to be more
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: A different kind of poverty now upsets me so
W: Night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know
W: Why am I so alone?
W: Where is my woman, can I bring her home?
W: Have I driven her away? Is she gone?
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed
W: I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head
W: I embrace the many colored beast
W: I grow weary of the torment, can there be no peace?
W: And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease

W: Won't you please come to Chicago just to sing?
W: In a land that's known as freedom
W: how can such a thing be fair?
W: Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring?

W: Politicians, sit yourselves down
W: there's nothing for you here.
W: Won't you please come to Chicago... for a ride?
W: Don't ask Jack to help you
W: 'cause he'll turn the other ear.
W: Won't you please come to Chicago or else join the other side?
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: We can change... the world,
W: rearrange... the world (It's dying)
W: If you believe in justice (It's dying)
W: and if you believe in freedom (It's dying)
W: Let a man live his own life (It's dying)
W: Rules and regulations, who needs them?
W: Throw 'em out the door...
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Somehow people must be free
W: I hope the day comes soon
W: Won't you please come to Chicago, show your face?
W: From the bottom of the ocean
W: to the mountains of the moon.
W: Won't you please come to Chicago? No one else can take your place.
W:

W: 
W: [Verse 1]
W: Midnight, that old clock keeps ticking.
W: The kids are all asleep,  and I'm walking the floor.
W: Darlin', I can see that you're dreaming.
W: And I don't wanna wake you up,  when I close the door.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.
W: And a businessman don't know what that means.
W: There's a garden outside she works in every day.
W: And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's,
W: gonna come and take it all away.
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Lately, I've been thinking 'bout daddy.
W: And how he always made things work,  when the chips were down.
W: And I know, I've got something inside me.
W: There's always a light there to guide me,  to what can't be found.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.
W: And a businessman don't know what that means.
W: There's a swing outside the kids play on every day.
W: And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's,
W: gonna come and take it all away.

W: Standing on an empty lot,  holding hands.
W: Later, we came back in the moonlight.
W: And made love right where the kitchen is,  then we made our plans.
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.

W: Have you seen Panama
W: Where I first fell in love
W: It will forever be an emerald necklace
W: Set between the seas
W: 
W: Beside a crystal stream
W: In the mountains of Chiriqui
W: I saw a girl astride a horse she waved at me
W: I was fifteen
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land
W: Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama?
W: 
W: Went riding off alone
W: Much further than I should have gone
W: I wandered deep into the dark
W: Now which way gets me home
W: 
W: Then suddenly there she was
W: All covered with leaves and dust
W: I couldn't believe it but she followed me
W: Now both of us were lost
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land
W: Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama?
W: 
W: The clouds began to rumble
W: We found a dry piece of jungle
W: I don't remember if It rained
W: But I remember making love
W: 
W: So clearly I recall
W: The magic of Panama
W: And surely never will it let me go
W: Yo Soy Panameno
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land

W: I was with you, you were alone, now I'm standing here
W: Wisdom came only after you'd gone
W: So I'm starting all over with a tear in my eye
W: I just never thought you'd disappear

W: A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes

W: Intro:
W: 
W: Verse:
W: 
W: Clear blue skies, not too much to ask for,
W: They were here before we came,
W: Will they be here when we're gone?
W: Clean water, not too much to hope for,
W: It's the basis of our lives
W: And without it we are done.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Well we can keep our eyes upon the skies
W: And see how the time goes by
W: Or we can find our fears among the tears
W: That fall when the meadows cry, cry cry.
W: 
W: Instrumental part of verse
W: Repeat chorus
W: 
W: Clear ideas, much too much to think of.
W: We need all the help we can get
W: we need all the time that we've got
W: we need all the love we can give,
W: 
W: Then G Bm7 part again.

W: There's a ship
W: And it sails a sea of light
W: On it's way to me tonight
W: From a distant shore
W: Taking me home once more
W: 
W: And the waves
W: And the whistling of the wind
W: Make me come alive again
W: My destiny's at my door
W: 
W: Going to leave this town forever
W: And go where I'll never
W: Nead an overcoat no more, where they cry ...
W: 
W: Ooh lalalala, every night and every day
W: Sitting by the Gulf coast just a thousand miles away
W: Where they cry ...
W: Ooh lalalala, on an island I will dwell
W: Starlit nights in paradise on the Isle of Sanibel
W: 
W: There's a girl
W: And I see her dressed in white
W: As she lies there in the night
W: I can hear her cry
W: Where has he gone and why
W: 
W: But she knows
W: That someday he will arrive
W: And it keeps her love alive
W: Dreams can never die
W: 
W: She looks across the ocean
W: At sails in motion
W: In the early morning sky, where they cry ...
W: 
W: Angels of the water, sirens of the sea
W: Whispering there sweet love songs
W: Calling out to me

W: For de signal of ma little lady love.
W: 
W: She's my lady love
W: She is my dove, my baby love

W: There once was a ship that put to sea
W: And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
W: The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
W: Blow, me bully boys, blow
W: 
W: Soon may the Wellerman come
W: To bring us sugar and tea and rum
W: One day, when the tonguing' is done
W: We'll take our leave and go
W: 
W: She had not been two weeks from shore
W: When down on her a right whale bore
W: The captain called all hands and swore
W: He'd take that whale in tow ...
W: 
W: Before the boat had hit the water
W: The whale's tail came up and caught her
W: All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
W: When she dived down below ...
W: 
W: No line was cut, no whale was freed
W: And the captain's mind was not on greed
W: But he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
W: She took that ship in tow ) ...
W: 
W: For forty days or even more
W: The line went slack then tight once more
W: All boats were lost, there were only four
W: And still that whale did go ...
W: 
W: As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
W: The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
W: The Wellerman makes his regular call
W: To encourage the captain, crew and all
W: 
W: Soon may the Wellerman come
W: To bring us sugar and tea and rum

W: Oh, Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
W: From glen to glen, and down the mountain side,
W: The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
W: It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.
W: But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
W: Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
W: It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
W: Oh, Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so!
W: 
W: But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
W: If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
W: Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,
W: And kneel and say an Ave there for me;
W: And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
W: And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
W: For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
W: And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!

W: across the ocean wild and wide
W: to where your heart has ever been
W: since first you were my bonny bride
W: The roses all have left your cheeks
W: I watched them fade away and die
W: You voice is sad whene're you speak
W: and tears bedim your loving eyes
W: So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again
W: 
W: I know you love me Kathleen dear
W: your heart was ever fond and true
W: I always feel when you are near
W: That life holds nothing dear but you
W: the smiles that once you gave to me
W: I scarcely ever see them now
W: the many, many times I see
W: a darkening shadow on your brow
W: Oh So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again
W: 
W: To that dear home beyond the sea
W: My Kathleen shall again return
W: And when thy old friends welcome thee
W: Thy loving heart will cease to yearn
W: Where laughs the little silver stream
W: beside your mother's humble cot
W: and brightest rays of sunshine gleam
W: To where your grief will be forgot
W: so So I will take you back Kathleen
W: to where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I will take you to your home again

W: The minstrel boy to the war is gone
W: In the ranks of death you will find him
W: His father's sword he's girded on
W: And his wild harp slung behind him

W: "Tho' all the world betrays thee
W: One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
W: One faithful harp shall praise thee"

W: An old man gazed on a photograph
W: In a locket he'd worn for years;
W: His nephew then asked him the reason why
W: That picture had caused him tears.
W: "Come listen," he said, "I will tell you, lad,
W: A story that's strange, but true!
W: Your father and I, at the school one day,
W: Met two little girls in blue.
W: That picture is one of those girls," he said
W: And to me she was once a wife;
W: I thought her unfaithful, we quarrelled lad,
W: And parted that night for life.
W: My fancy of jealousy wronged a heart,
W: A heart that was good and true -
W: For two better girls never lived than they,
W: Those two little girls in blue."
W: 
W: Refrain
W: 
W: Two little girls in blue, lad,
W: Two little girls in blue.
W: They were sisters, we were brothers
W: And learned to love the two.
W: And one little girl in blue, lad,
W: Who won your father's heart,
W: Became your mother. I married the other,
W: And now we have drifted apart.

W: Verse 1
W: I wander'd today to the hill, Maggie,
W: To watch the scene below;
W: The creek and the old rusty mill, Maggie,
W: Where we sat in the long, long ago.
W: The green grove is gone from the hill, Maggie,
W: Where first the daisies sprung;
W: The creaking old mill is still, Maggie,
W: Since you and I were young.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: And now we are aged and gray, Maggie,
W: And the trials of life nearly done;
W: But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie,
W: When you and I were young.
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: A city so silent and lone, Maggie,
W: Where the young and the gay and the best,
W: In polished white mansions of stone, Maggie,
W: Have each found a place of rest,
W: Is built where the birds used to play, Maggie,
W: And join in the songs that were sung;
W: For we sang as gay as they, Maggie,
W: When you and I were young.
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: They say I am feeble with age, Maggie,
W: My steps are less sprightly than then;
W: My face is a well-written page, Maggie,
W: But time alone was the pen.
W: They say we are aged and gray, Maggie,
W: As spray by the white breakers flung;
W: But to me you're as fair as you were, Maggie
W: When you and I were young.

W: Verse 1
W: The soldier came knocking upon the queen's door
W: He said, "I am not fighting for you anymore"
W: And the queen knew she'd seen his face someplace before
W: And slowly she let him inside
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: He said, "I've watched your palace up here on the hill
W: And I've wondered who's the woman for whom we all kill
W: But I am leaving tomorrow, and you can do what you will
W: Only first I am asking you why"
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: Down the long narrow hall he was led
W: Into her room with her tapestries red
W: And she never once took the crown from her head
W: She asked him there to sit down
W: 
W: Verse 4
W: He said, "I see you now and you are so very young
W: But I've seen more battles lost than I have battles won
W: And I've got this intuition says it's all for your fun
W: And now will you tell me why?"
W: 
W: Verse 5
W: Well the young queen, she fixed him with an arrogant eye
W: She said, "You won't understand, and you may as well not try"
W: But her face was a child's, and he thought she would cry
W: But she closed herself up like a fan
W: 
W: Verse 6
W: And she said, "I have swallowed a secret burning thread
W: It cuts me inside and often I've bled"
W: And he laid his hand then on the top of her head
W: And he bowed her down to the ground
W: 
W: Bridge
W: OooooooooooooH
W: OooooooooooooooH
W: 
W: Verse 7
W: "Tell me how hungry are you, how weak you must feel
W: you are living here alone and you are never revealed
W: But I won't march again on your battlefield"
W: And he took her to the window to see
W: 
W: Verse 8
W: And the sun it was gold, though the sky it was grey
W: And she wanted more than she ever could say
W: But she knew how it frightened her and she turned away
W: And would not look at his face again
W: 
W: Verse 9
W: He said, "I want to live as an honest man
W: To get all I deserve and to give all I can
W: And to love a young woman whom I don't understand
W: Your highness, your ways are very strange"
W: 
W: Verse 10
W: But the crown, it had fallen, and she thought she would break
W: And she stood there ashamed of the way her heart ached
W: And she took him to the doorstep and she asked him to wait
W: She would only be a moment inside
W: 
W: Verse 11 play chords sharply
W: Out in the distance her order was heard
W: And the soldier was killed still waiting for her word
W: And while the queen went on strangling in the solitude she preferred
W: The battle continued on
W: 
W: Ooooooooooooooooh
W: Oooooooooooooooooh
W: 
W: fade

V:1 
W: Charlotte Lyngbye   21/2/2023
W: 
W: Lately we’ve been moving around this house like total strangers
W: Rarely talking, and barely co-existing
W: Sneaking ‘round these rooms, avoiding tricky conversations
W: Following the path of least resistance
W: 
W: ‘Cos every time I gaze your way
W: When you think that I’m not looking
W: You seem so sad
W: and I feel sad too
W: Should I go or should I stay?
W: And try fixing what is broken
W: I can live without you,
W: but I don't want to
W: I don't want to
W: 
W: We occupy the same space, but we’re miles apart
W: You are doing your thing, and I do mine
W: The daily awkward silences are tearing at my heart
W: And got between us somewhere along the line
W: 
W: Should I go or should I stay?
W: And could we go the distance?
W: It begs the question
W: What am I to do?
W: If I knew we could recover
W: what was lost along the way
W: I'd gladly stick it out
W: and see it through
W: I’d see it through
W: 
W: What is going to happen if the floodgates ever open
W: And the dam walls come crashing down
W: Buckling from the weight of all the things unspoken

T: Don't Be Too Polite Girls
C:Glen Tomasetti
B: songs
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: We're really on the way, girls, really on the way,
W: Hooray for equal pay, girls, hooray for equal pay,
W: They're going to give it to most of us, in spite of all their fears
W: But do they really need to make us wait three years.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: Don't be too polite girls, don't be too polite,
W: Show a little fight girls, show a little fight,
W: Don't be fearful of offending, in case you get the sack
W: Just recognise your value and we won't look back.
W: 
W: I sew up shirts and trousers in the clothing trade,
W: Since men don't do the job I can't ask to be better paid
W: The people at the top rarely offer something more
W: Unless the people underneath are walking out the door.
W: 
W: They say a man needs more to feed his children and his wife,
W: Well, what are the needs of a woman who leads a double working life?
W: When the whistle blows for knock-off it's not her time for fun
W: She goes home to start the job that's not paid and never done.
W: 
W: Don't be too afraid girls, don't be too afraid,
W: We're clearly underpaid girls, clearly underpaid,
W: Tho' equal pay in principle is every woman's right
W: To turn that into practice, we must show a little fight.
W: 
W: We can't afford to pay you, say the masters in their wrath
W: But woman says "Just cut your coat according to the cloth"
W: If the economy won't stand then here's the answer boys,
W: "Cut out the wild extravagance on the new war toys".
W: 
W: All among the bull girls, all among the bull,
W: Keep your hearts full girls, keep your hearts full
W: What good is a man as a doormat, or following at heel?
W: It's not their balls we're after, it's a fair square deal.

W: Boy they're 'gonna hang you high
W: 
W: Eighteen hundred and seventy eight
W: Was the year I remember so well
W: They put my father in an early grave
W: Slung my mother in gaol
W: Now I don't know what's right or wrong
W: But they hung Christ on nails
W: Six kids at home and two still on the breast
W: They wouldn't even give her bail

W: Poor Ned, you're better off dead

W: "If I had his money, I could do things my way"

W: One rich man in ten, with a satisfied mind
W: 
W: Once I was winning in fortune and fame
W: Everything that I dreamed for, to get a start in life's game
W: Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime
W: But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
W: 
W: Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
W: Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
W: The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
W: Compared to the man with a satisfied mind
W: 
W: When life has ended and my time has run out
W: My friends and my loved ones will leave, there's no doubt
W: But there's one thing for certain when it comes my time
W: I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

W: That the union makes us strong

W: Solidarity forever
W: Solidarity forever

W: For the union makes us strong
W: 
W: In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold

W: For the union makes us strong

W: Solidarity forever
W: Solidarity forever

W: And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
W: For the loser now will be later to win
W: For the times, they are a-changin'
W: Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
W: Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
W: For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
W: The battle outside ragin'
W: Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
W: For the times, they are a-changin'
W: 
W: Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
W: And don't criticize what you can't understand
W: Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
W: Your old road is rapidly aging
W: Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
W: For the times, they are a-changin'
W: 
W: The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
W: The slow one now will later be fast
W: As the present now will later be past
W: The order is rapidly fading
W: And the first one now will later be last
W: For the times, they are a-changin'

W: [Verse 1]
W: There are women of many descriptions
W: In this queer world, as everyone knows
W: Some are living in beautiful mansions
W: And are wearing the finest of clothes
W: There are blue blood queens and princesses
W: Who have charms made of diamonds and pearl
W: But the only and thoroughbred lady
W: Is the Rebel Girl
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: That’s the Rebel Girl, the Rebel Girl!
W: To the working class, she’s a precious pearl
W: She brings courage, pride and joy
W: To the fighting Rebel Boy
W: We’ve had girls before, but we need some more
W: In the Industrial Workers of the World
W: For it’s great to fight for freedom
W: With a Rebel Girl
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Yes, her hands may be hardened from labor
W: And her dress may not be very fine
W: But a heart in her bosom is beating
W: That is true to her class and her kind
W: And the grafters in terror are trembling
W: When her spite and defiance she’ll hurl
W: For the only and thoroughbred lady
W: Is the Rebel Girl
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: That’s the Rebel Girl, the Rebel Girl!
W: To the working class, she’s a precious pearl
W: She brings courage, pride and joy

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I came from the dream-time, from the dusty red soil plains
W: I am the ancient heart, the keeper of the flame.
W: I stood upon the rocky shore, I watched the tall ships come.
W: For forty thousand years I've been the first Australian.
W: 
W: I came upon the prison ship, bowed down by iron chains.
W: I cleared the land, endured the lash and waited for the rains.
W: I'm a settler, I'm a farmer's wife on a dry and barren run
W: A convict then a free man, I became Australian.
W: 
W: I'm the daughter of a digger who sought the mother lode
W: The girl became a woman on the long and dusty road
W: I'm a child of the depression, I saw the good times come
W: I'm a bushy, I'm a battler, I am Australian
W: 
W: We are one, but we are many
W: And from all the lands on earth we come
W: We share a dream and sing with one voice:
W: I am, you are, we are Australian
W: 
W: I'm a teller of stories, I'm a singer of songs
W: I am Albert Namatjira, I paint the ghostly gums
W: I am Clancy on his horse, I'm Ned Kelly on the run
W: I'm the one who waltzed Matilda, I am Australian
W: 
W: I'm the hot wind from the desert, I'm the black soil of the plains
W: I'm the mountains and the valleys, I'm the drought and flooding rains
W: I am the rock, I am the sky, the rivers when they run
W: The spirit of this great land, I am Australian
W: 
W: We are one, but we are many
W: And from all the lands on earth we come
W: We share a dream and sing with one voice:
W: I am, you are, we are Australian
W: 
W: We are one, but we are many

V:1 
W: 
W: Verse 1
W: Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
W: And where have you been, my darling young one?
W: I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
W: I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
W: Stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
W: I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
W: Been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
W: And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
W: It’s a hard rain gonna fall
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
W: And what did you see, my darling young one?
W: I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
W: I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
W: I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin’
W: I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin’
W: I saw a white ladder all covered with water
W: I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
W: And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
W: And it’s a hard rain's gonna fall
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: What did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
W: And what did you hear, my darling young one?
W: I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warnin’
W: Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
W: I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’
W: Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’
W: I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin’
W: Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
W: And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard
W: It’s a hard rain gonna fall
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 4
W: Who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
W: Who did you meet, my darling young one?
W: I met a young child beside a dead pony
W: I met a white man who walked a black dog
W: I met a young woman whose body was burning
W: I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
W: I met one man who was wounded in love
W: I met another man who was wounded in hatred
W: It’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
W: It’s a hard rain gonna fall
W: 
W: 
W: Verse 5
W: And what’ll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
W: And what’ll you do now, my darling young one?
W: I’m goin’ back out ’fore the rain starts a-fallin’
W: I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
W: Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
W: Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
W: Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
W: 
W: The executioner’s face is always well hidden
W: Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
W: Where black is the color and none is the number
W: And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
W: 
W: Reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
W: Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin’
W: But I know my song well before I start singin’
W: And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
W: 
W: It’s a hard rain gonna fall
W: 
W: 
W: Coda
W: It’s a hard rain gonna fall

W: Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
W: And I knew right then, I'd be taking a whirl
W: Around the Salthill prom with a Galway girl
W: 
W: We were halfway there when the rain came down
W: Of a day-i-ay-i-ay
W: She asked me up to her flat downtown
W: Of a fine soft day-i-ay
W: And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do?
W: Because her hair was black and her eyes were blue
W: I took her hand and I give her a twirl
W: And I lost my heart to a Galway girl
W: 
W: When I woke up, I was all alone
W: With a broken heart and a ticket home
W: And I ask you now, tell me what would you do?
W: If her hair was black and her eyes were blue
W: 'Cause I've traveled around, I've been all over this world
W: Boys, I ain't never seen nothing like a Galway girl

W: [D]In Newry town I was [C]bred and b[G]orn
W: 
W: [D]In Stephen's Green n[C]ow I lie i[G]n scorn
W: 
W: [Am]I served my t[C]ime at the sadler's[D] trade
W: 
W: [D]And I always was a r[C]oving blad[G]e.
W: 
W: At seventeen I took a wife,
W: And I loved her dearer than I loved my life.
W: And for to keep her both fine and gay,
W: I went a'robbing on the King's highway.
W: 
W: I never robbed any poor man yet,
W: Nor honest trader caused I to fret.
W: But I robbed lords and their ladies fine,
W: And carried the gold home to my heart's delight.
W: 
W: To Covent Garden I took my way,
W: With my dear wife, for to see the play.
W: Lord Fielding's men they did me pursue,
W: And taken was I by that cock-feathered crew.
W: 
W: My father cried "my darlin' son!"
W: My wife she cried "I am undone!"
W: My mother tore her white locks and cried,
W: That in the cradle I should have died.
W: 
W: When I am dead, ay and for my grave,
W: No fancy funeral pray let me have.
W: Six highwaymen for to carry me,
W: Give them broad swards and sweet liberty.
W: 
W: Six pretty fair maids to bear my pall,
W: Give them sweet roses and green garlands all.
W: When I am dead they may speak the truth He
W: was a wild and a wicked youth.
W: 
W: In Newry town I was bred and born
W: In Stephen's Green now I lie in scorn.
W: I served my time at the sadler's trade,
W: And I always was a roving blade.

V:1 
W: One Sunday morning as I went walking
W: By Brisbane waters I chanced to stray
W: I heard a prisoner his fate bewailing
W: As on the sunny river bank he lay
W: I am a native from Erin's island
W: Transported now from my native shore
W: They tore me from my aged parents
W: And from the maiden whom I adore
W: 
W: I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
W: At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
W: At Castle Hill and cursed Toongabbie
W: At all those settlements I've woked in chains
W: But of all places of condemnation
W: And penal stations of New South Wales
W: Of Moreton Bay I have found no equal
W: Excessive tyranny each day prevails
W: For three long years I was beastly treated
W: And heavy irons on my legs I wore
W: My back from flogging was lacerated
W: And often slain with my crimson gore
W: And many a man from downright starvation
W: Lies mouldering underneath the clay
W: And Captain Logan he had us mangled
W: At the triangles in Moreton Bay
W: 
W: Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
W: We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
W: Till a native black lying there in ambush
W: Did give our tyrant his mortal stroke
W: My fellow prisoners exhilarated
W: That all such monsters a death shall find
W: And when from bondage we're liberated
W: Our former sufferings shall fade from mind

W: As they see the vibrant star,
W: Crown of thorns and colors bright,

W: The starfish ate the coral,

W: The shells feel sad ness,
W: For their friends, there is no pause.
W: 
W: As they approach the regal star,
W: Their eyes now catch the view,
W: The coral, damaged, hurt and bare,
W: Their shock and awe are true.

W: 
W: Verse 1
W: This year I got myself in a jamb
W: I’ve been totally broke and down on my luck
W: Lost everything I own to an internet scam
W: That left me so hopelessly short of a buck
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: So I am off to the casino to play
W: Though gambling is against my grain
W: I wanna be the king of all I survey
W: And enjoy life of wealth and fame
W: 
W: Verse 2
W: I’m feeling lucky and hanging on to my place
W: As the bartender pours me a fancy drink
W: That helps me keep my pokerface
W: It’s crunch time now, will I swim or sink
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Feeling lucky and expecting a win
W: I slam another bet onto the poker table
W: The wheels and my head are in a spin
W: I’m starting to feel a touch unstable
W: 
W: Verse 3
W: But I need to get all my money back
W: Some people say that gambling is a sin
W: But shall I go for red or black?
W: I feel it in my bones I’m all set to win
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: But later on as I walk back home again
W: Without a penny to my name
W: My head is bent down deep in shame
W: As I am dragging my feet along in the rain
W: 
W: Verse 4
W: There never was a shortcut to fortune and fame
W: Only downfall and defeat
W: I only have myself to blame
W: Humiliation is complete
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: I should have chosen a better way
W: And never gone against my grain
W: And done an honest days work for an honest days pay
W: Now I have to start all over again

W: # verse
W: The evening sun descends around the mountain side
W: When the day is done and it’s time for us to hide
W: Hide away in the twilight hour
W: Like the petals closing in upon a flower
W: 
W: I’ve never had pretentions of a poet
W: But if anyone could bring one out in me
W: It’s you, lovely you, and you know it
W: You’re as gentle and as precious as can be
W: 
W: # chorus
W: This one’s for [YOU]
W: It’s just for [YOU]
W: ‘Cos [you and me
W: We’re a special place to be]
W:

W: It has been a long and interesting journey
W: There has been pleasure and some pain
W: There’s been ups and there’s been downs

W: # instr
W: 
W: # bridge
W: [There is value in the mundane and the ordinary
W: and the routine, humdrum of every day
W: Keeping it plain
W: Never lifting more than we can carry
W: So that we won’t lose our way]

W: In their suits
W: Making their laws to suit
W: Their wealthy mates in suits
W: With all their money
W: As they wine and dine
W: On the taxpayer’s dime
W: Despite the lawsuits
W: Where the swine always wins,
W: Never pays for their sins
W: They’re untouchable
W: And Powerful
W: Getting their kicks
W: While nothing sticks

W: But don’t you bloody call me honey
W: I guess you think you’re funny

W: To be woke
W: But give me a break

W: And on the take
W: And you’ll never know what Mama is really made of
W: 
W: Watch those swine,
W: masters of the universe
W: Hanging there like grapes on a vine
W: Dog whistling

W: 
W: I met you in a pub downtown
W: And felt your gravitational force
W: You came on to me like a shooting star
W: 
W: But something made me change my course
W: As all your friends gathered around
W: where you were leaning against the bar
W: 
W: I quietly stood my ground
W: And watched you from afar
W: 
W: ‘Cos you’re a mystery
W: Hiding out in the universe
W: Never touching down
W: or connecting with the earth
W: 
W: I thought I’d seen a star
W: But all I see when I look at your face
W: is just a deep black hole
W: Or a big old empty space
W: 
W: I watched you through my telescopic eye
W: You make an interesting study
W: casually fooling everybody
W: 
W: You seem to get your kicks and highs
W: deflecting connection
W: and avoiding detection
W: 
W: I watch you do your thing
W: Making your moves, drawing everyone in
W:

W: # verse
W: All alone
W: Running down the alleyway of broken dreams
W: Tripping over stolen bikes and busted TV screens
W: Carefully
W: Sneaking round the corners hiding out
W: From what he is
W: Or what his mind tells him that he wants to be
W: 
W: # chorus
W: [Who’s the wolf and
W: who’s the sheep
W: He’s lost himself too deep in this old tale
W: No escape,
W: he’s trapped and gasping
W: Jaws agape
W: waiting to exhale]
W: 
W: # verse
W: There are two of them
W: Hanging close behind him in the night
W: One is black, one is white, one on his left, one on his right
W: Bloody is the fight
W: 
W: # bridge
W: [Where’s that wolf
W: Who’s that creature that will soon become his doom
W: Lifting its head, baring its fangs
W: Howling at the moon]

W: My tired old eyes are straightening
W: Squinting in the yellowing light
W: Tired and worn out I'm headed south
W: 
W: Following those white lines
W: As I drive into the night
W: I'm drying at the corners of my mouth
W: 
W: My windscreens gone OK
W: But splatters mar my sight
W: But I see the emerging of the ?fool?

W: A journey through the night
W: I promise I'll be coming home soon

W: # bridge
W: I'm tired of motorway food
W: Tired of mouldy motel rooms
W: And the stink of musty old bedspreads

W: I've had it with bad coffee
W: And with highway exhaust fumes
W: Fed up with backward small town boneheads
W: 
W: # verse
W: I roll my window down ?a slide?
W: Roll into some random branch of the town
W: Stop for fuel in the middle of nowhere
W: 
W: Try to buy myself a meal
W: But settle for a chips and burger deal
W: It's dry and tasteless so no suprises
W: 
W: It's enough to keep me moving
W: To get me through until the dawn
W: It's been weeks since the last time I shot through
W: 
W: And my radio is soothing
W: While I drive until the morn
W: As I'm heading home, heading home to you.

W: # VERSE
W: In my head I'm so busy, don't hear what you say
W: Want only to follow my thoughts on their way
W: Or a laser I'm hearing your words but I can't
W: Accept them or see what you say in my light
W: 
W: # CHORUS
W: Can't say I'll want to, or even pretend.
W: Don't always see how my words strike and rend
W: I'm not the one, validation to seek
W: But I can promise, to be me.

W: Open, I read off the room like a pro
W: But nervous babble and bluntness leak
W: In the comfort of home and trusted ones
W: So much nicer to say just what I see

W: Surprisingly it comes together in the end

W: 
W: I get annoyed with doors that squeak 
W: Blocked up drains and taps that leak
W: And at careless folks who litter the place
W: I don’t much like getting egg on my face
W: 
W: I hate it when people smack when they eat
W: When someone leaves up the toilet seat
W: Fake fingernails make me nauseous
W: But to speak it loudly I must be cautious
W: 
W: Everywhere I look I find food for my displeasure 
W: I find it when I’m busy, even when I am at leisure
W: So much in this world goes against my grain
W: It prays on my mind and drives me insane
W: 
W: CHORUS:    But maybe it’s just me
W: Maybe it’s just me
W: Maybe it’s just me
W: Because I want what I want 
W: or only see what I want to see
W: 
W: And don’t get me started on PMT
W: And the Uber rich and pay TV
W: Or lame moronic bumper stickers 
W: And yuppy hipster city slickers
W: 
W: I worry when my kids don’t call me back  
W: about getting old and having a heart attack
W: About boisterous men in bars
W: And pimply teens in souped up cars
W: 
W: This constant outrage must give me some kind of kick 
W: Or why keep beating myself with my frustration stick
W: There’s so much for me to feel uptight about  
W: From atop of my soap box I’ll shout, shout, shout
W: 
W: CHORUS:        
W: 
W: I worry about singing out of tune
W: And sound like I’m howling at the moon
W: When I get stuck writing a song 
W: and every line sounds terribly wrong
W: 
W: I don’t like the fret buzz on my guitar 
W: And the fact that I’ll never be a rock star
W: I despair when I’m feeling uncertain 
W: Or find mould on my shower curtain

W: And who’s gonna be there when I’m going out tonight
W: A red-nose clown, stepping into the light
W: 
W: I’m walking through the door, there’re people everywhere
W: I am shaking in my boots until I find a chair
W: Feeling safer now I’ve got my back against a wall
W: I face the floor, afraid of standing tall
W: 
W: 
W: CHORUS:   I’ve been here before, It’s an old and familiar fear
W: I‘ll  fight or flight or just plainly disappear
W: Clinging to my drink just to occupy my hands 
W: An awkwardness that no one understands  
W: 
W: I watch you walk across the room, heading in my way
W: My words escape and I’m afraid of what to say
W: You seem so warm and friendly as you fidget with your keys
W: I’m wondering do you feel as scared as me
W: 
W: BRIDGE:    Could it really be, that you are just like me
W: That we’re all the same, playing the same game?
W: Pretending we’re ok, to make it through the day
W: Trying to shake it, we fake it to make it
W: 
W: You seem to buy my act; I am pretending to be cool
W: My foot in my mouth I’m feeling like a fool
W: I act so brave; I laugh and giggle but crumbling inside

W: 
W: VERSE 
W: You’ve been stealing kisses from me since the day we met 
W: And you look so pleased each time and laugh inside I bet
W: I can’t help surrendering, because you look so nice
W: And I don’t mind it when you kiss me twice
W: 
W: Then you stole my balance too, I feel weak in my knee
W: And you took my eyesight so I no longer can see
W: All I have are spectacles now tinted with a rose
W: You smell so lovely, since you seized my nose
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: A thief and a knave, you seem to rob me blind
W: I’ll let you seize my heart and soul, I’ve let you steal my mind
W: I’ll let you poach my house, my bike, my cat, my friends, my car
W: But keep your thieving hands off my guitar.
W: 
W: Now I lost my hearing too, you plundered it away
W: I struggle hearing others talking right throughout my day
W: But once you whisper words of love close into my ear
W: All my trials and troubles disappear
W: 
W: So promise you’ll come home to me each and every night 
W: You can pick my locks because I know you’ll do it right 
W: Feel free to rummage through my pantry looking for a feed
W: And devour whatever it is you think you need
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: A thief and a knave, you seem to rob me blind
W: I’ll let you seize my heart and soul, I’ve let you steal my mind
W: I’ll let you poach my house, my bike, my cat, my friends, my car
W: But no way in hell you’re touching my guitar.
W: 
W: You pilfer, burgle, poach, embezzle, confiscate and snatch
W: My heart was under lock and key but you still picked my latch
W: You wrote the book on hijack, grand theft and larceny
W: Each day with you is daylight robbery

W: Bye Bye Clawhammer -  (James Bond Theme)                             Charlotte Lyngbye 24 May 2023
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: A rogue and traitor
W: A malicious buffoon
W: A liar and a hater
W: A vindictive tycoon
W: 
W: A fool who fools the fools
W: In his petulant manner
W: Breaking all the rules
W: wielding his clawhammer
W: 
W: Gold on his fingers
W: From the day that he was born
W: We’ll have no peace
W: Until he’s dead and gone
W: 
W: His monkey wrenched mouth
W: Commands death and destruction
W: With speech and tiny hammer fist
W: He begs a bloody production
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: For the love of God and homeland
W: For the love of you
W: I pledge to stand up 
W: and fight for what is true
W: 
W: He must be silenced
W: And banished once and for all
W: To the sound of a drum, we’ll
W: nail him to his own wall
W: 
W: He’ll do no harm
W: Once he’s gagged and bound
W: With his own clawhammer
W: We’ll put him ten feet under ground
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: 
W: BRIDGE
W: Bye bye Clawhammer
W: Bye bye Clawhammer
W: 
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: For the love of my homeland
W: For the love of you
W: I pledge to stand up
W: and fight for what is true
W: 
W: But this is not a TV show
W: In which Mr Bond gets his girl
W: But a real-life death blow
W: To the state of our world  
W: 
W: Truth can be stranger than fiction
W: depending on perception
W: And though I am not a murderess
W: To stamp out him out I’d gladly make an exception.

W: 
W: # A
W: Fondest memories of my childhood,
W: choosing icecreams as a treat,
W: at the local grocery store.
W: Calypso gelato in summer is refreshing,
W: but the milky choices always abound,
W: reaching deep into the freezer
W: Rich  and creamy, cool and fresh
W: 
W: # B
W: Nibble on the nuts atop a Cornetto
W: Peel the chocolate sheets from a Magnum
W: Bite the nose of, bubble oh bill or a Caramello
W: Ice cream is the way to go
W: 
W: # A
W: A Paddle Pop from Streets is unadulterated,
W: maybe try a Splice with a layer of ice.
W: Or a yummy crunchy Golden Gaytime.
W: Try a Peters' Drumstick or simple frozen Frosty Fruit,
W: or a Bulla creamy choc chip tub.
W: Biscuit layered Cadberries Oreo.
W: Many choices, what is best?
W: 
W: # B
W: Nibble on the nuts atop a Cornetto
W: Peel the chocolate sheets from a magnum
W: Bite the nose of bubble oh bill or a Caramello
W: Ice cream is the way to go
W: 
W: # A
W: Sitting soaked in sunscreen in the summer sun.
W: Watching ice cream dribble down my thumb.
W: Licking it all up before it runs.
W: Better finish quick 'for it starts to slide off the,
W: little wooden handle to the waiting sand.
W: Still too cold to hold in my hand.
W: Summer ice creams, what a mess.

W: # verse
W: In the warm hint of Spring I feel, fear in my bones
W: And despair as I watch my poor trees dry as stone
W: And the wind makes me think of a raging firestorm
W: That will come as we head into Summer.
W: 
W: The weeks upon weeks choking smoke, seems like yesterday
W: Air filter, masks I have stashed away for next time.
W: Fear watching fire reports, guessing where wind will go
W: If it comes, I know for sure, my home is gone.
W: 
W: 
W: #chorus
W: Just leave it underground
W: No cause to burn our crust
W: We can find our energy
W: In sunshine and wind, oceans and rain
W: 
W: 
W: Too late for our children, who will bear the brunt of change
W: And wear the task to find better ways to sustain
W: Need to be real that the horrors foreseen
W: Assumed that we'd pull in our heads.
W: 
W: A future of violence of climate and more,
W: as political borders restrict what we need
W: and the scum at the top hang on to their greed
W: And islands sink under the sea.
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: # bridge
W: I feel helpless, contemplating, just how little I can do
W: Living simply is an answer but not if it's just me and you.
W: 
W: # verse
W: Against opposition, it's government policy,
W: managing climate and thinking ahead
W: But still not enough to stop climate disaster
W: Hindered by lobby groups
W: 
W: A plan protecting our, human resources
W: To find opportunity, in changing times
W: 'though our politics stinking, our superpower thinking,
W: A plan for a future based on what we know.

W:  
W: #verse
W: Right here and right now
W: It’s all getting kinda scary
W: Uncertain and unsettling
W: It’s getting hard to keep it light
W: 
W:  What kind of fresh hell awaits us all
W: Or calamity on the horizon
W: Who is the boogieman waiting around the corner
W: Hiding in behind my door 
W: 
W: # chorus
W: But on a long enough timeline
W: none of this will matter
W: Cos we’ll all be 6 feet under ground
W: With or without us
W: Dead or alive
W: This earth will keep spinning around around  around
W: 
W: # verse
W: They say let’s work for change
W: Build resilience and adapt
W: I wish I had the answer
W: but I don’t
W: 
W: We’re all expendable
W: And will one day be forgotten
W: Or only remembered for doing a bad job
W: And fucking it all up
W: 
W: # bridge
W:  I am worried and angry
W: And I know that it seems
W: I have an awful lot to say
W: I know when I point my finger
W: At others wrongdoing
W: The other 3 points my own way
W: 
W: # chorus
W: But on a long enough timeline
W: none of this will matter
W: Cos we’ll all be 6 feet under ground

W: # verse
W: At sixteen, at a concert, where the waving fans all screamed
W: With the last of six adopted girls, I fell head over heels
W: Her mum cracked me up, waved a finger, "you wear two condoms young man"
W: While the silky played chase with the cats in a general pandemonium.
W: 
W: Twenty three  a hot blond mum in a sweet little country town
W: where theatre and musical community abound
W: Despite the lusting, trusting and the music that we shared
W: In my tender years, free as a bird, commitment wasn't there
W: 
W: # chorus
W: I was the wrong man at the wrong time
W: it just wasn't meant to be
W: The wrong man at the wrong time
W: was all that I could be
W: 
W: #verse
W: Twenty seven a Nederlander, of a serious tone
W: Both sensible and anxious, prone to gnaw a mental bone
W: As we separated, a child she started growth
W: And the consequential story surely brought me low
W: 
W: Thirty six a young traveller spent a year here on the farm
W: She was easy, smart and gentle, helped me start to feel alive
W: But she had a future of study, a home on a different shore
W: Now we always write on birthdays, sharing joyful crazy tales.
W: 
W: # chorus
W: 
W: #verse
W: Forty three a love challenging, facing temper based in fear
W: Alcohol fuelled anger is not, something nice to see
W: I tried to be healing and but also retreating back into my shell
W: Torn between the comfort and desire to run like hell
W: 
W: Fifty, a lifelong friend, her /marriage met it's end
W: Fire kindled but aborted, as re/ality kicked in
W: Her head full of so many things that our /sparks were a stress not a win
W: And again, not the time or the /place, to begin
W:
