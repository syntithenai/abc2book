W: I don't believe in Angels with wings
W: Or a choir invisible that does nothing but sing
W: or golden light around a Boticeli smile
W: 'cause you can't call them up when you're desperate to dial
W: and Gabriel's playing that trumpet all day
W: must make it hard to hear people pray
W: but I do believe in Angels on earth who go about their business with no thought of its worth.
W: 
W: They're my kind of Angel...
W: 
W: Are you looking in the garden? are you looking in the Sky?
W: Angels aren't marble and Angels can't fly
W: but once in a while they turn up on time with tattoos and spanners and a face made for crime.
W: They're waiting on tables, they're working in labs
W: They're delivering papers and babies in cabs
W: They do what they can but not always what they should
W: My kind of Angel is bad and is good.
W: Everyone's a devil, though the good book may scoff
W: but a devil is an angel on a rostered day off
W: 
W: They're my kind of Angel....
W: 
W: I've examined your body and you don't have wings.
W: You don't have a halo and you don't always sing
W: but once on a blue moon you turned up on time
W: and killed the villain in my pantomime
W: You're my kind of Angel
W: You're my kind of Angel
W: once on a blue moon you turned up on time
W: and killed the villain in my pantomime

W: Yesterday a child came out to wander
W: Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
W: Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
W: And tearful at the falling of a star
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
W: Skated over ten clear frozen streams
W: Words like, "When you're older" must appease him
W: And promises of someday make his dreams
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: 16 springs and 16 summers gone now
W: Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
W: And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
W: 'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: So the years spin by and now the boy is 20
W: Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
W: There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
W: Before the last revolving year is through
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game

W:

W: I'm singing in the shower, turn the water power, up so I get a lot of steam
W: A little bit of lather, hell it doesn't matter, I didn't come here to get clean
W: Standing for a while, shout against the tiles, imagining an audience all around
W: When I'm singing in the shower, I perform for hours, listen to how good I sound!
W: 
W: Do ray me far so la tee do
W: 
W: Melancholy baby, a 10 o'clock with daisy, classical jazzical and pop
W: I can sing Ieda, while the water meter is spinning like a top

W: When I'm singing in the shower, I perform for hours, listen to how good I sound!

W: Starry, starry night
W: Paint your palette blue and gray
W: Look out on a summer's day
W: With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
W: Shadows on the hills
W: Sketch the trees and the daffodils
W: Catch the breeze and the winter chills
W: In colors on the snowy, linen land
W: Now, I understand what you tried to say to me
W: And how you suffered for your sanity
W: And how you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they did not know how
W: Perhaps they'll listen now
W: 
W: Starry, starry night
W: Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
W: Swirling clouds in violet haze
W: Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
W: Colors changing hue
W: Morning fields of amber grain
W: Weathered faces lined in pain
W: Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
W: Now, I understand, what you tried to say to me
W: How you suffered for your sanity
W: How you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they did not know how
W: Perhaps they'll listen now
W: 
W: For they could not love you
W: But still your love was true
W: And when no hope was left inside
W: On that starry, starry night
W: You took your life as lovers often do
W: But I could have told you, Vincent
W: This world was never meant for one
W: As beautiful as you
W: 
W: Starry, starry night
W: Portraits hung in empty halls
W: Frameless heads on nameless walls
W: With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
W: Like the strangers that you've met
W: The ragged men in ragged clothes
W: The silver thorn of bloody rose
W: Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
W: Now, I think I know what you tried to say to me
W: How you suffered for your sanity
W: How you tried to set them free
W: They would not listen, they're not listening still
W: Perhaps they never will

W: This is my Earth
W: And I live in it
W: It’s one third dirt
W: And two thirds water
W: And it rotates and revolves through space
W: At rather an impressive pace
W: And never even messes up my hair
W: And here’s the really weird thing
W: The force created by its spin
W: Is the force that stops the chaos flooding in
W: This is my Earth
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my country
W: And I live in it
W: It’s pretty big
W: And nice to walk on And the bloke who runs my country
W: Has built a demagoguery
W: And tought us to be fearful and boring
W: And the wierdest thing is that he is
W: Conservative of politics
W: But really rather radical of eyebrow
W: This is my country
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my house
W: And I live in it
W: It’s made of cracks
W: And photographs
W: We rent it off a guy who bought it from a guy
W: Who bought it from a guy
W: Whose grandad left it to him
W: And the weirdest thing is that this house
W: Has locks to keep the baddies out
W: But they’re mostly used to lock ourselves in
W: This is my house
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it's mine
W: 
W: This is my body
W: And I live in it
W: It’s 31
W: And 6 months old
W: It’s changed a lot since it was new
W: It’s done stuff it wasn’t built to do
W: I often try to fill it up with wine
W: And the weirdest thing about it is
W: I spend so much time hating it
W: But it never says a bad word about me
W: This is my body
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: 
W: This is my brain
W: And I live in it
W: It’s made of love
W: And bad song lyrics
W: It’s tucked away behind my eyes
W: Where all my screwed up thoughts can hide
W: Cos God forbid I hurt somebody
W: And the weirdest thing about a mind
W: Is that every answer that you find
W: Is the basis of a brand new cliché
W: This is my brain
W: And it’s fine
W: It’s where I spend the vast majority of my time
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine
W: It’s not perfect
W: I’m not quite sure I’ve worked out how to work it
W: It’s not perfect
W: But it’s mine

W: And ice cream castles in the air
W: And feather canyons everywhere

W: So many things I would have done

W: Really don't know love at all

W: Tears and fears and feeling proud
W: To say, "I love you" right out loud
W: Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
W: I've looked at life that way
W: 
W: Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
W: And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
W: Well something's lost, but something's gained
W: In living every day
W: 
W: I've looked at life from both sides now
W: From win and lose and still somehow
W: It's life's illusions I recall
W: I really don't know life at all
W: It's life's illusions that I recall

W: I ache for the touch of your lips, dear
W: But much more for the touch of your whips, dear
W: You can raise welts Like nobody else
W: As we dance to the Masochism Tango
W: 
W: Let our love be a flame, not an ember
W: Say it's me that you want to dismember
W: Blacken my eye Set fire to my tie

W: Before you here I stand
W: My heart is in my hand
W: It's here that I must be
W: 
W: My heart entreats
W: Just hear those savage beats
W: And go put on your cleats
W: And come and trample me
W: 
W: Your heart is hard as stone or mahogany
W: That's why I'm in such exquisite agony
W: My soul is on fire It's aflame with desire
W: Which is why I perspire when we tango
W: 
W: You caught my nose
W: In your left castanet, love
W: I can feel the pain yet, love
W: Every time I hear drums
W: 
W: And I envy the rose
W: That you held in your teeth, love
W: With the thorns underneath, love
W: Sticking into your gums
W: 
W: Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches
W: The last time I needed twenty stitches
W: To sew up the gash That you made with your lash
W: As we danced to the Masochism Tango
W: 
W: Bash in my brain
W: And make me scream with pain
W: Then kick me once again
W: And say we'll never part
W: 
W: I know too well
W: I'm underneath your spell
W: So, darling, if you smell
W: Something burning, it's my heart
W: 
W: Take your cigarette from its holder
W: And burn your initials in my shoulder
W: Fracture my spine And swear that you're mine
W: As we dance to the Maso-chism Tango

W: At the dawning of the day
W: 
W: On Grafton Street in November
W: We tripped lightly along the ledge
W: Of a deep ravine where can be seen
W: The worth of passion's pledge
W: The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
W: And I'm not making hay
W: Oh I love too much and by such by such
W: Is happiness thrown away
W: 
W: I gave her gifts of the mind
W: I gave her the secret signs
W: That known to the artists who have known
W: The true gods of sound and stone
W: And word and tint to without stint
W: I gave her poems to say
W: With her own name there
W: And her own dark hair
W: Like clouds over fields of May
W: 
W: On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
W: I see her walking now
W: Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
W: That I had loved not as I should
W: A creature made of clay
W: When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
W: His wings at the dawn of day

W: All along the lee shore
W: Shells lie scattered in the sand
W: Winking up like shining eyes, at me
W: From the sea
W: 
W: Here is one like sunrise
W: It's older than you know
W: It's still lying there where
W: Some careless wave
W: Forgot it long ago
W: 
W: When I awoke this morning
W: I dove beneath my floating home
W: Down below her graceful side
W: In the turning tide
W: To watch the sea fish roam
W: 
W: There I heard a story
W: From the sailors of the Sandra Marie
W: There's another island a
W: Day's run away from here
W: And it's empty and free
W: 
W: From here to Venezuela
W: There's nothing more to see
W: Than a hundred thousand islands
W: Flung like jewels upon the sea
W: For you and me
W: 
W: Sunset smells of dinner
W: Women are calling at me to end my tails
W: But perhaps I'll see you,
W: The next quiet place
W: I furl my sails

W: Earl Richard is a-hunting gone,
W: As fast as he could ride
W: His hunting horn hung round his neck
W: And broadsword by his side
W: 
W: He rode till he came to my lady's gate
W: He telled out the pin
W: And answered yes she had said
W: To rise and let him in
W: 
W: “Oh light, oh light, Earl Richard,” she said,
W: “Oh light and stay the night
W: You shall have cheer with charcoal clear
W: And candles burning bright”
W: 
W: “I will not light, I cannot light
W: I cannot light at all
W: A fairer lady than ten of you
W: Is waiting now at Richard's hall.”
W: 
W: He stooped down from his milk white steed
W: To kiss her rosy cheek
W: She had a pen knife in her hand
W: And wounded him so deep
W: 
W: “Oh lie ye there, oh lie ye there
W: Oh lie ye there till morn
W: A fairer lady than ten of me
W: Will think long of your coming home.”
W: 
W: She's called the servants one by one
W: She's called them two by two
W: “I have a dead man in my bower
W: I wish he were away.”
W: 
W: Then one's a-take him by the hands
W: The other by the feet
W: They've thrown him in the deep draw-well
W: Full fifty fathom deep
W: 
W: Then up bespake a little bird
W: That sits upon a tree
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.”
W: 
W: “Come down, come down, oh my pretty bird
W: That sits upon the tree,
W: I have a cage of beaten gold
W: That I will give to thee.”
W: 
W: “Go home, go home you false lady
W: And pay your maids a fee.
W: For as you have done to Earl Richard
W: So would you do to me.”
W: 
W: “If I had an arrow in my hand
W: And a bow bent on a string
W: I'd shoot a dart at thy proud heart
W: Among the leaves so green.”

W: [Verse 1]
W: Now I've heard there was a secret chord
W: That David played, and it pleased the Lord
W: But you don't really care for music, do ya?
W: It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W: The minor fall, the major lift
W: The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Your faith was strong but you needed proof
W: You saw her bathing on the roof
W: Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
W: She tied you to a kitchen chair
W: She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
W: And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: You say I took the name in vain
W: I don't even know the name
W: But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
W: There's a blaze of light in every word
W: It doesn't matter which you heard
W: The holy or the broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: I did my best, it wasn't much
W: I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
W: I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
W: And even though it all went wrong
W: I'll stand before the lord of song
W: With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah

W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Baby, I've been here before
W: I know this room, I've walked this floor
W: I used to live alone before I knew you
W: And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
W: Love is not a victory march
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: There was a time you let me know
W: What's really going on below
W: But now you never show it to me, do you?
W: And remember when I moved in you
W: The holy dove was moving too
W: And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Maybe there's a God above
W: But all I've ever learned from love
W: Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
W: And it's not a cry that you hear at night
W: It's not somebody who's seen the light
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

W: When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
W: Me money alas I spent too fast, got drunk as drunk could be
W: And when my money was all gone 'twas then I wanted more
W: But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: I spent the night with Angeline
W: Too drunk to roll in bed
W: My watch was new and my money too
W: In the mornin' with 'em she fled
W: And as I roamed the streets about
W: The whores they all would roar
W: Here comes Jack Rack, the young sailin' lad
W: He must go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: As I was walkin' down the street
W: I met with Rapper Brown
W: I asked for him to take me in
W: And he looked at me with a frown
W: He said "Last time you was paid off
W: With me you jobbed no score
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance
W: And I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance and I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: I hired me aboard of a whaling ship
W: Bound for the Artic seas
W: Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
W: And Jamaican rum would freeze
W: And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear
W: For I'd lost all my money ashore
W: 'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
W: So I'd gone to sea no more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more.
W: 
W: Some days we're catching whales me lads
W: And some days we're catching none
W: With a twenty foot oar cocked in our hands
W: From four o'clock in the morn
W: And when the shades of night come in
W: We rest on our weary oar
W: 'Twas then I wished that I was dead
W: Or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then I wished that I was dead or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: Come all you bold seafarin' men
W: And listen to my song
W: If you come off of them long trips
W: I'd have ya's not go wrong
W: Take my advice, drink no strong drink
W: Don't go sleeping with no whores
W: Get married instead and spend all night in bed
W: So you'll go to sea no more
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

W: [Verse 1]
W: She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
W: The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
W: Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
W: And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
W: There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
W: We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
W: And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
W: That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
W: She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
W: But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
W: Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
W: But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
W: For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
W: And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
W: Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
W: Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
W: Or I'd never have the strength to go below
W: But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
W: Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
W: Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
W: She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
W: And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
W: They won't be laughing in another day
W: And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
W: With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
W: Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
W: And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

W: It's an angry sea but there is no doubt
W: That the lighthouse will keep shining out
W: To warn the lonely sailor
W: And the lightning strikes and the wind cuts cold
W: Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul

W: The island lies like a leaf upon the sea.
W: Green island like a leaf new-fallen from the tree.
W: Green turns to gold,
W: as morning breeze gently shakes the barley,
W: bending the yellow corn.
W: Green turns to gold,
W: there’s purple shadows on the distant mountains.
W: Sun in the yellow corn.
W: 
W: They came in their long ships from lands across the sea.
W: They came in their long ships – they saw the land was green.
W: Wind in the barley,
W: trout and salmon leaping in the rivers.
W: Sun in the yellow corn.
W: Leaping ashore
W: they slaughtered those laboured in the barley,
W: scything them down like corn.
W: 
W: The long ships sailed away and new invaders came.
W: With long bow and lance bringing death in England’s name.
W: With sword and with mace,
W: they went reaping though the fields of barley,
W: They plundered the yellow corn.
W: Crop followed crop,
W: they prospered in their killing fields of barley,
W: The harvest of new young corn.
W: 
W: Marching down the years the men of war they came,
W: with bombs, assassins, bullets, CS gas and guns.
W: Ghosts from the past
W: are chasing shadows through the fields of barley
W: hiding in the new young corn.
W: Nine hundred years
W: they tried to trap the wind that shakes the barley.

W: On the first day of March it was raining
W: It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen
W: I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there
W: I wish that all this rain would stop falling down on me
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: At the time I was working for a landlord
W: And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen
W: And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore
W: And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitch's bastard's whore
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: I recall that we took care of him one Sunday
W: We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls
W: And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real
W: But all I know is I left the place without a penny or fuckall
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: But now I've the most charming of verandahs
W: I sit and watch the junkies, the drunks, the pimps, the whores
W: Five green bottles sitting on the floor
W: I wish to Christ, I wish to Christ
W: That I had fifteen more
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink
W: And mother wake me early in the morning
W: 
W: The boys and me are drunk and looking for you
W: We'll eat your frigging entrails and we won't give a damn
W: Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam
W: And my brother earned his medals at My Lai in Vietnam
W: 
W: And it's lend me ten pounds, I'll buy you a drink

W: One summer evening drunk to hell
W: I sat there nearly lifeless
W: An old man in the corner sang
W: "Where The Water Lilies Grow"
W: And on the jukebox Johnny sang
W: About a thing called love
W: And it's how are you kid and what's your name
W: And how would you bloody know?
W: 
W: In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
W: I lay down on the ground
W: And the arms and legs of other men
W: Were scattered all around
W: Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
W: Then prayed and bled some more
W: And the only thing that I could see
W: Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
W: But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
W: There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
W: [Chorus]
W: And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
W: For a pair of brown eyes
W: 
W: I looked at him he looked at me
W: All I could do was hate him
W: While Ray and Philomena sang
W: Of my elusive dreams
W: I saw the streams, the rolling hills
W: Where his brown eyes were waiting
W: And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
W: That waited once for me
W: 
W: So drunk to hell I left the place
W: Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
W: A hungry sound came across the breeze
W: So I gave the walls a talking
W: And I heard the sounds of long ago
W: From the old canal
W: And the birds were whistling in the trees
W: Where the wind was gently laughing
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: [Verse 1]
W: Well Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
W: He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
W: He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
W: And they all looked very happy in the morning
W: But Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
W: Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
W: When he'd had too many Powers
W: So sad to see the grieving of the people that he's leaving
W: And he took the road for God knows in the morning
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: The years passed by, the times had changed, I grew to be a man
W: I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally MacLennane
W: I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
W: And ended up a barman in the morning
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
W: I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
W: I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
W: And some people left for heaven without warning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone
W: Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again
W: (Far away!)
W: [Chorus]
W: I'm sad to say I must be on my way
W: So buy me beer or whiskey cause I'm going far away (far away!)
W: I'd like to think of me returning when I can
W: To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: When Jimmy came back home he was surprised that they were gone
W: He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
W: Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked
W: Took the road for heaven in the morning
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: We walked him to the station in the rain
W: We kissed him as we put him on the train
W: And we sang him a song of times long gone

W:

W: There were once two Irish labouring men; to England they came over;
W: And they tramped about in search of work from Liverpool to Dover.
W: Says Mike to Pat, “I'm tired of this; we're both left in the lurch;
W: And if I don't get work, bedad, I'll go and rob a church.”
W: 
W: “What, rob a church!” says Pat to Mike; “How could you be so vile?
W: For something sure would happen while we're going down the aisle.
W: But if you do I'll go with you; and we'll get safe out, I hope;”
W: So, listen and I'll tell you now how Paddy stole the rope.
W: 
W: While off they went with theft intent to the place they wanted finding;
W: And they broke inside of a country church where nobody was minding.
W: And they scraped together all they could, they were prepared to slope,
W: When Paddy says, “Now hold on, Mike, what have we got for rope?
W: 
W: For we have no bag to hold our swag, and before we get outside,
W: With something strong and stout, my lad, this bundle must be tied.”
W: And just then he spied the church bell rope, and before you could turn about,
W: He did ride up the belfry high to climb that rope so stout.
W: 
W: And holding on by one hand and leg, he pulled his clasp knife out,
W: And right above his hand and head he cut that rope so stout.
W: Well, he quite forgot it held him up, and, by the Holy Pope,
W: Down to the bottom of the church fell Paddy and the rope.
W: 
W: “Come out of that,” says Mike to Pat, “and will you stop your moaning,
W: “If that's the way you steal a rope, it's no wonder that you're groaning.
W: I'll show you how to steal the rope, if you lend to me your knife.”
W: “O Mike, go easy,” says old Pat, “or else you'll lose your life.”
W: 
W: So Mike climbed up the other rope, just like an antelope
W: But instead of cutting it off above, he cut it off below.
W: Down fell the other piece of rope and Mike was left on high.
W: “Come down”, says Pat. “I can't,” says Mick, “for if I drop, I'll die.”
W: 
W: Well their noise it brought the beagles out, the sexton and police,
W: And though they got poor Micky down, they spared them no release.
W: And for their ingenuity they have now a wider scope
W: Than when they broke inside a church to go and steal the rope.

W: And they called her the Irish Rover
W: 
W: There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
W: There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W: There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
W: And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
W: And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W: And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
W: Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W: We had two million barrels of bone
W: We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
W: We had four million barrels of stone
W: We had five million hogs and six million dogs
W: And seven million barrels of porter
W: We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
W: In the hold of the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
W: And our ship lost her way in the fog
W: And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
W: 'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
W: Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
W: We nearly tumbled over
W: Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
W: Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

W: [Verse 1]
W: The canals and the bridges, the embankments and cuts
W: They blasted and dug with their sweat and their guts
W: They never drank water but whiskey by pints
W: And the shanty towns rang with their songs and their fights
W:

W: I am going across the ocean, love, to seek for something new.
W: Come change your ring with me, dear girl,
W: Come change your ring with me,
W: For it might be a token of true love while I am on the sea.
W: 
W: And when I'm far upon the sea you'll know not where I am.
W: Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.
W: The secrets of your heart, dear girl,
W: Are the best of my good will,
W: So let my body be where it might, my heart will be with you still.

W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are plowing through the deep.
W: There's nothing to protect us, love,
W: Or keep us from the cold,
W: On the ocean wide, where we must fight like jolly seamen bold.
W: 
W: There's a heavy storm arising, see how it gathers round,
W: While we poor souls on the ocean wide are fighting for the crown.
W: Our officers commanded us,
W: And them we must obey,
W: Expecting every moment for to get cast away.
W: 
W: But when the war is over, there'll be peace on every shore,
W: We'll return to our wives and out families, and the girls that we adore.
W: We'll drink out liquor merrily,
W: And spend out money free,
W: And when the money is all gone -- we'll boldly go to sea.

W: I was impressed like everyone,
W: When man began to fly,
W: Out of earthly regions,
W: To planets in the sky.
W: With total media coverage,
W: We watched the heros land,
W: As ceremoniously
W: They disturbed the cosmic sand.
W: 
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative,
W: Will get you from here to there.

W: When you're out there in the stars,
W: Oh, the intergalactic laxative
W: Will get you from here to Mars.
W: 
W: In awe with admiration,
W: We listened to the talk.
W: Such pride felt they,
W: Such joy to be
W: Upon the moon to walk.
W: My romantic vision shattered,
W: When it was explained to me,
W: Spacemen wear old diapers
W: In which they shit and pee.

W: Their food is specially prepared
W: To dissolve into slush.
W: Absorbed by multi-fibers
W: In the super diaper suit,

W: In case of anti-gravity -
W: Pee gets on the loose.

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: a bit of you ma
W: 
W: V1
W: Always there with kindness in your eyes. An ear and a smile and some safety for a while.
W: Always there with simple honest truth. From the heart to the mouth. Sometimes too soon.
W: Always with the energy to play. To take the time to share our ways.
W: Now that you are gone I hope to keep. A bit of you, inside of me.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: Inside me, inside us a bit of you.
W: Your honesty and kindness and warmth in your eyes
W: Inside us, inside me a bit of you
W: Walking with us always by our side
W: 
W: V2
W: Will we hold together as we've done. Without your warmth and endless talk.
W: What will we do together what will we eat. Who'll make our favorite Xmas treats.
W: Who will have the news of distant friends and family making ends.
W: Changes they will come to suit our needs but that bit inside will keep us tied.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: V3
W: Who will tell me everythings alright. Say I've done well. Enjoy my play.
W: Who will counsel kindness over all. To feel for others frailties.
W: Who will make feel that I'm OK. Who will love me no matter what I say.
W: Only I can hold that bit for me. And know that I am loved from your long sleep.
W: 
W: CHORUS
W: 
W: V4
W: Some might promise we will meet again. In one true place, no hurt or pain.
W: I draw more to know that you're inside. A part of sense, how I decide.
W: My music and my twitches and my friends. Expressing you through me.
W: You will always be inside of me. A bit of you, inside of me.

W: You should never have let me begin, begin,
W: You should never have let me begin.

W: 
W: Oh she cast away her silken gown,
W: She cast away her pride;
W: And ran with him into the night,
W: Down to the sea so wild.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: Sit once more by a round fireside,
W: With your head upon my knee!
W: 
W: Oh I’d rather live an hour here,
W: Than seven long years with thee.
W: And feel the salt spray on my cheek,
W: And know that I am free.
W: 
W: Oh she danced in the wind and she danced in the rain,
W: on the edge of the cliffs and the shore!
W: And she tasted the salt upon her cheek,
W: And never came home no more!
W: 
W: Till ... a babe was born on a summers morn,
W: He was his parents joy.
W: His mother held him to her heart,
W: Her precious gypsy boy.
W: 
W: She took him to her fathers house,
W: She beat upon the gate.
W: Crying, ‘come and see my darling babe,
W: We named him for your sake’.
W: 
W: Come home! Come home! My bonny little child,
W: Come home again to me!
W: And the father of that darlin' babe
W: Shall be a son to me.
