W: Frosty the Snowman, was a jolly happy soul,
W: With a corn cob pipe and a button nose, and two eyes made of coal.
W: 
W: Frosty the Snowman, is a fairytale, they say.
W: He was made of snow, but the children know he came to life one day.
W: 
W: There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found,
W: 
W: For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around!
W: 
W: Oh, Frosty, the Snowman, was alive as he could be;
W: and the children say he could laugh and play,
W: just the same as you and me.
W: 
W: Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
W: look at Frosty go.
W: 
W: Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump,
W: over the hills of snow.
W: 
W: Frosty the Snowman, knew the sun was hot that day,
W: so he said, "Let's run, and we'll have some fun now, before I melt away."
W: 
W: Down to the village, with a broomstick in his hand,
W: Running here and there, all around the square,
W: sayin', "Catch me if you can."
W: 
W: He led them down the streets of town, right to the traffic cop;
W: 
W: and only paused a moment, when he heard him holler, "Stop!"
W: 
W: For Frosty, the Snowman, had to hurry on his way,
W: But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't cry, I'll be back again some day."

W: The First Noel the angel did say
W: Was to certain poor shepherds
W: in fields as they lay;
W: In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,
W: On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
W: 
W: Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
W: Born is the King of Israel.
W: 
W: They looked up and saw a star
W: Shining in the east beyond them far,
W: And to the earth it gave great light,
W: And so it continued both day and night.
W: 
W: And by the light of that same star
W: Three wise men came from country far;
W: To seek for a king was their intent,
W: And to follow the star wherever it went.
W: 
W: This star drew nigh to the northwest,
W: O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
W: And there it did both stop and stay
W: Right over the place where Jesus lay.
W: 
W: 
W: Then entered in those wise men three
W: Full reverently upon their knee,
W: and offered there in his presence
W: Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
W: 
W: Then let us all with one accord
W: Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
W: That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
W: And with his blood mankind hath bought

W: On the Feast of Stephen
W: When the snow lay round about,
W: Deep, and crisp, and even:
W: Brightly shone the moon that night,
W: Though the frost was cruel,
W: When a poor man came in sight,
W: Gath'ring winter fuel.
W: 
W: 2. "Hither page and stand by me,
W: If thou know'st it, telling,
W: Yonder peasant, who is he?
W: Where and what his dwelling?"
W: "Sire, he lives a good league hence.
W: Underneath the mountain;
W: Right against the forest fence,
W: By Saint Agnes' fountain."
W: 
W: 3. "Bring me flesh, and bring me wine,
W: Bring me pine-logs hither:
W: Thou and I will see him dine,
W: When we bear them thither."
W: Page and monarch forth they went,
W: Forth they went together;
W: Through the rude wind's wild lament,
W: And the bitter weather.
W: 
W: 4. "Sire, the night is darker now,
W: And the wind blows stronger;
W: Fails my heart, I know now how,
W: I can go no longer."
W: "Mark my footsteps, good my page;
W: Tread thou in them boldly;
W: Thou shalt find the winter's rage
W: Freeze thy blood less coldly."
W: 
W: 5. In his master's steps he trod,
W: Where the snow lay dinted;
W: Heat was in the very sod
W: Which the Saint had printed.
W: Therefore, Christian men, be sure,
W: Wealth or rank possessing,
W: Ye who now will bless the poor,
W: Shall yourselves find blessing.
W:

W: 1. While shepherds watch’d their flocks by night,
W: All seated on the ground,
W: The angel of the Lord came down,
W: And glory shone around.
W: “Fear not,” said he, for mighty dread
W: Had seized their troubled mind;
W: “Glad tidings of great joy I bring
W: To you and all mankind.”
W: 
W: 2. “To you, in David’s town this day,
W: Is born of David’s line
W: The Savior who is Christ the Lord,
W: And this shall be the sign:
W: The heav’nly Babe you there shall find
W: To human view displayed,
W: All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
W: And in a manger laid.”
W: 
W: 3. Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
W: Appeared a shining throng
W: Of angels praising God, who thus
W: Addressed their joyful song:
W: “All glory be to God on high
W: And on the earth be peace.
W: Goodwill henceforth from heav’n to men
W: Begin and never cease.”

W: 
W: =========================
W: I really like Christmas
W: It's sentimental, I know
W: But I just really like it
W: 
W: I am hardly religious
W: I'd rather break bread with Dawkins
W: Than Desmond Tutu, to be honest
W: 
W: And yes, I have all of the usual objections
W: To consumerism
W: To the commercialisation of an ancient religion
W: To the westernisation of a dead Palestinian
W: Press-ganged into selling PlayStations and beer
W: But I still really like it
W: I'm looking forward to Christmas
W: Though I'm not expecting
W: A visit from Jesus
W: 
W: I'll be seeing my dad
W: My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
W: They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
W: I'll be seeing my dad
W: My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
W: They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
W: 
W: I don't go in for ancient wisdom
W: I don't believe just 'cause ideas are tenacious
W: It means they're worthy
W: 
W: I get freaked out by churches
W: Some of the hymns that they sing have nice chords
W: But the lyrics are dodgy
W: 
W: And yes, I have all of the usual objections
W: To the miseducation
W: Of children who, in tax-exempt institutions
W: Are taught to externalise blame
W: And to feel ashamed
W: And to judge things as plain right and wrong
W: But I quite like the songs
W: You might also like
W: Kill Bill
W: SZA
W: Love Language
W: SZA
W: Low
W: SZA
W: I'm not expecting big presents
W: The old combination of socks, jocks and chocolates
W: Is just fine by me
W: 
W: Cause I'll be seeing my dad
W: My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
W: They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
W: I'll be seeing my dad
W: My brother and sisters, my gran and my mum
W: They'll be drinking white wine in the sun
W: 
W: And you, my baby girl
W: My jetlagged infant daughter
W: You'll be handed round the room
W: Like a puppy at a primary school
W: And you won't understand
W: But you will learn someday
W: That wherever you are and whatever you face
W: These are the people who'll make you feel safe
W: In this world
W: My sweet blue-eyed girl
W: 
W: And if my baby girl
W: When you're twenty-one or thirty-one
W: And Christmas comes around
W: And you find yourself nine thousand miles from home
W: You'll know what ever comes
W: Your brothers and sisters and me and your mum
W: Will be waiting for you in the sun
W: Whenever you come
W: Your brothers and sisters, your aunts and your uncles
W: Your grandparents, cousins and me and your mum
W: We'll be waiting for you in the sun
W: Drinking white wine in the sun
W: Darling, when Christmas comes
W: We'll be waiting for you in the sun
W: Drinking white wine in the sun
W: Waiting for you in the sun
W: Waiting for you
W: Waiting
W: 
W: I really like Christmas
W: It's sentimental, I know
