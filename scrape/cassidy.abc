W: While in the merry month of May, from me home I started?
W: Left the girls of Tuam nearly brokenhearted?
W: Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother?
W: Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
W: 
W: Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born
W: ?Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts?
W: And goblin' brand new pair of brogues to rattle o'er the bogs?
W: And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin
W: 
W: One, two, three four, five?
W: Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road?
W: And all the way to Dublin', whack-fol-la-de-da
W: 
W: In Mullingar that night, I rested, limbs so weary?
W: Started by daylight, next mornin' light and airy?
W: Took a drop of the pure to keep me heart from sinking?
W: That's the paddy's cure when there he's on for drinking
W: 
W: To see the lassies smile laughing all the while?
W: At my curious style, 'twould set your heart a-bubblin'?
W: Asked if was I hired, and wages I required?
W: Till I was almost tired over the rocky road to Dublin
W: 
W: One, two, three, four, five?Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky roads?And all the way to Dublin', whack-fol-la-de-da
W: 
W: In Dublin' next arrived, I thought it such a pity?
W: To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city?
W: Then I took a stroll all among the quality?
W: Bundle it was stolen in that neat locality
W: 
W: Something crossed me mind when I looked behind?
W: No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'?
W: Crying after the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue?
W: It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin'
W: 
W: From there I got away, me spirits never failing?
W: Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing?
W: The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he?
W: Then I jumped aboard a cabin found for paddy
W: 
W: Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs?
W: Played some hearty jigs, the water 'round me bubblin'?
W: And when off Holyhead, wished myself was dead
W: ?Or better far instead on the rocky road to Dublin'
W: 
W: The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed?
W: Called myself a fool, I could no longer stand it?
W: Blood began to boil, temper I was losing?
W: Poor Old Erin's Isle they began abusing
W: 
W: Hooray me soul, says I, me Shillelagh I let fly?
W: Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobble in?
W: Then with a loud hurray, they joined me in the affray?
W: Quickly cleared the way on the rocky road to Dublin

W: Yesterday a child came out to wander
W: Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
W: Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
W: And tearful at the falling of a star
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
W: Skated over ten clear frozen streams
W: Words like, "When you're older" must appease him
W: And promises of someday make his dreams
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: 16 springs and 16 summers gone now
W: Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town
W: And they tell him, "Take your time, it won't be long now
W: 'Til you drag your feet to slow the circles down"
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: So the years spin by and now the boy is 20
W: Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
W: There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
W: Before the last revolving year is through
W: And the seasons, they go round and round
W: And the painted ponies go up and down
W: We're captive on the carousel of time
W: We can't return, we can only look
W: Behind, from where we came
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game
W: And go round and round and round, in the circle game

W: Rows and flows of angel hair
W: And ice cream castles in the air
W: And feather canyons everywhere
W: Looked at clouds that way
W: 
W: But now they only block the sun
W: They rain and they snow on everyone
W: So many things I would have done
W: But clouds got in my way
W: 
W: I've looked at clouds from both sides now
W: From up and down and still somehow
W: It's cloud illusions I recall
W: I really don't know clouds at all
W: 
W: Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
W: The dizzy dancing way that you feel
W: As every fairy tale comes real
W: I've looked at love that way
W: 
W: But now it's just another show
W: And you leave 'em laughing when you go
W: And if you care, don't let them know
W: Don't give yourself away
W: 
W: I've looked at love from both sides now
W: From give and take and still somehow
W: It's love's illusions that I recall
W: I really don't know love
W: Really don't know love at all
W: 
W: Tears and fears and feeling proud
W: To say, "I love you" right out loud
W: Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
W: I've looked at life that way
W: 
W: Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
W: And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
W: Well something's lost, but something's gained
W: In living every day
W: 
W: I've looked at life from both sides now
W: From win and lose and still somehow
W: It's life's illusions I recall
W: I really don't know life at all
W: It's life's illusions that I recall
W: I really don't know life
W: I really don't know life at all

W: On Raglan Road of an autumn day
W: I saw her first and knew
W: That her dark hair would weave a snare
W: That I might one day rue
W: I saw the danger and I passed
W: Along the enchanted way
W: And I said let grief be a fallen leaf
W: At the dawning of the day
W: 
W: On Grafton Street in November
W: We tripped lightly along the ledge
W: Of a deep ravine where can be seen
W: The worth of passion's pledge
W: The Queen of Hearts still making tarts
W: And I'm not making hay
W: Oh I love too much and by such by such
W: Is happiness thrown away
W: 
W: I gave her gifts of the mind
W: I gave her the secret signs
W: That known to the artists who have known
W: The true gods of sound and stone
W: And word and tint to without stint
W: I gave her poems to say
W: With her own name there
W: And her own dark hair
W: Like clouds over fields of May
W: 
W: On a quiet street where old ghosts meet
W: I see her walking now
W: Away from me so hurriedly my reason must allow
W: That I had loved not as I should
W: A creature made of clay
W: When the angel woos the clay he'll lose
W: His wings at the dawn of day

W: [Verse 1]
W: Now I've heard there was a secret chord
W: That David played, and it pleased the Lord
W: But you don't really care for music, do ya?
W: It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
W: The minor fall, the major lift
W: The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Your faith was strong but you needed proof
W: You saw her bathing on the roof
W: Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya
W: She tied you to a kitchen chair
W: She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
W: And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: You say I took the name in vain
W: I don't even know the name
W: But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
W: There's a blaze of light in every word
W: It doesn't matter which you heard
W: The holy or the broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Verse 4]
W: I did my best, it wasn't much
W: I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
W: I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
W: And even though it all went wrong
W: I'll stand before the lord of song
W: With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: Hallelujah, Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Baby, I've been here before
W: I know this room, I've walked this floor
W: I used to live alone before I knew you
W: And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
W: Love is not a victory march
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: There was a time you let me know
W: What's really going on below
W: But now you never show it to me, do you?
W: And remember when I moved in you
W: The holy dove was moving too
W: And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
W: 
W: [Additional Lyrics]
W: Maybe there's a God above
W: But all I've ever learned from love
W: Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
W: And it's not a cry that you hear at night
W: It's not somebody who's seen the light
W: It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

W: When first I landed in Liverpool I went upon a spree
W: Me money alas I spent too fast, got drunk as drunk could be
W: And when my money was all gone 'twas then I wanted more
W: But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: I spent the night with Angeline
W: Too drunk to roll in bed
W: My watch was new and my money too
W: In the mornin' with 'em she fled
W: And as I roamed the streets about
W: The whores they all would roar
W: Here comes Jack Rack, the young sailin' lad
W: He must go to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
W: 
W: As I was walkin' down the street
W: I met with Rapper Brown
W: I asked for him to take me in
W: And he looked at me with a frown
W: He said "Last time you was paid off
W: With me you jobbed no score
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance
W: And I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: But I'll take your advance and I'll give ya's a chance and I'll send you to sea once more
W: 
W: I hired me aboard of a whaling ship
W: Bound for the Artic seas
W: Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow
W: And Jamaican rum would freeze
W: And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear
W: For I'd lost all my money ashore
W: 'Twas then that I wished that I was dead
W: So I'd gone to sea no more
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more.
W: 
W: Some days we're catching whales me lads
W: And some days we're catching none
W: With a twenty foot oar cocked in our hands
W: From four o'clock in the morn
W: And when the shades of night come in
W: We rest on our weary oar
W: 'Twas then I wished that I was dead
W: Or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: Twas then I wished that I was dead or safe with the girls ashore
W: 
W: Come all you bold seafarin' men
W: And listen to my song
W: If you come off of them long trips
W: I'd have ya's not go wrong
W: Take my advice, drink no strong drink
W: Don't go sleeping with no whores
W: Get married instead and spend all night in bed
W: So you'll go to sea no more
W: No more boys no more, go to sea no more
W: A man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.

W: [Verse 1]
W: She went down last October in a pouring driving rain
W: The skipper, he'd been drinking and the Mate, he felt no pain
W: Too close to Three Mile Rock, and she was dealt her mortal blow
W: And the Mary Ellen Carter settled low
W: There was just us five aboard her when she finally was awash
W: We'd worked like hell to save her, all heedless of the cost
W: And the groan she gave as she went down, it caused us to proclaim
W: That the Mary Ellen Carter'd rise again
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend
W: She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end
W: But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below
W: Then they laughed at us and said we had to go
W: But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock
W: For she's worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock
W: And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: All spring, now, we've been with her on a barge lent by a friend
W: Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I've had the bends
W: Thank God it's only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
W: Or I'd never have the strength to go below
W: But we've patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down
W: Put cables to her, 'fore and aft and girded her around
W: Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain
W: And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Let her name not be lost to the knowledge of men
W: Those who loved her best and were with her 'til the end
W: Will make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again!

W: [Verse 4]
W: For we couldn't leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale
W: She'd saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
W: And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
W: They won't be laughing in another day
W: And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
W: With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
W: Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
W: And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again
W: [Chorus]
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, and life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Then like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!
W: Rise again, rise again!
W: Though your heart, it be broken, or life about to end
W: No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend
W: Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!

W: O the waves crash in and the tide pulls out
W: It's an angry sea but there is no doubt
W: That the lighthouse will keep shining out
W: To warn the lonely sailor
W: And the lightning strikes and the wind cuts cold
W: Through the sailor's bones to the sailor's soul
W: Till there's nothing left that he can hold
W: Except the rolling ocean
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready

W: And I should have realized
W: I had no reasons to be frightened
W: 
W: But I am ready for the storm, yes sir ready

W: One summer evening drunk to hell
W: I sat there nearly lifeless
W: An old man in the corner sang
W: "Where The Water Lilies Grow"
W: And on the jukebox Johnny sang
W: About a thing called love
W: And it's how are you kid and what's your name
W: And how would you bloody know?
W: 
W: In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
W: I lay down on the ground
W: And the arms and legs of other men
W: Were scattered all around
W: Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
W: Then prayed and bled some more
W: And the only thing that I could see
W: Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
W: But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
W: There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
W: [Chorus]
W: And a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go
W: For a pair of brown eyes
W: 
W: I looked at him he looked at me
W: All I could do was hate him
W: While Ray and Philomena sang
W: Of my elusive dreams
W: I saw the streams, the rolling hills
W: Where his brown eyes were waiting
W: And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
W: That waited once for me
W: 
W: So drunk to hell I left the place
W: Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
W: A hungry sound came across the breeze
W: So I gave the walls a talking
W: And I heard the sounds of long ago
W: From the old canal
W: And the birds were whistling in the trees
W: Where the wind was gently laughing
W: 
W: [Chorus]

W: In the Year of our Lord Eighteen Hundred and Six
W: We set sail from the cold cove of Cork
W: We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
W: For the grand City Hall in New York
W: She was a wonderful craft, she was rigged 'fore and aft
W: And lord how the trade winds drove her
W: She had twenty-three masts, and she stood several blasts
W: And they called her the Irish Rover
W: 
W: There was Barney McGee from the banks of the Lee
W: There was Hogan from County Tyrone
W: There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
W: And a man from Westmeath called Malone
W: There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
W: And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
W: And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
W: Was the skipper on the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
W: We had two million barrels of bone
W: We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
W: We had four million barrels of stone
W: We had five million hogs and six million dogs
W: And seven million barrels of porter
W: We had eight million sides of old blind horse's hides
W: In the hold of the Irish Rover
W: 
W: We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
W: And our ship lost her way in the fog
W: And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
W: 'Twas meself and the captain's old dog
W: Then the ship struck a rock; oh Lord, what a shock
W: We nearly tumbled over
W: Turned nine times around and the poor old dog was drowned
W: Now I'm the last of the Irish Rover

W: They never drank water but whiskey by pints
W: And the shanty towns rang with their songs and their fights
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Navigator, navigator rise up and be strong
W: The morning is here and there's work to be done
W: Take your pick and your shovel and the bold dynamite
W: For to shift a few tons of this earthly delight
W: Yes to shift a few tons of this earthly delight
W: [Verse 2]
W: They died in their hundreds with no sign to mark where
W: Save the brass in the pocket of the entrepreneur
W: By landslide and rockblast they got buried so deep
W: That in death if not life they'll have peace while they sleep
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Their mark on this land is still seen and still laid
W: The way for a commerce where vast fortunes were made
W: The supply of an empire where the sun never set
W: Which is now deep in darkness, but the railway's there yet

W: Come change your ring with me,

W: Our officers commanded us,

W: 
W: But when the war is over, there'll be peace on every shore,
W: We'll return to our wives and out families, and the girls that we adore.
W: We'll drink out liquor merrily,
W: And spend out money free,
W: And when the money is all gone -- we'll boldly go to sea.

W: And your beauty will haunt me, wherever I go
W: 
W: The white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree
W: Are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she
W: I gaze upon the cold moon til the stars drown in the warm sea
W: And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me
W: 
W: My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now
W: My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone
W: All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now
W: Another has taken my love for his own
W: The day it is approaching when we were to be married
W: But it's rather I would die than live only to grieve
W: Oh, meet me my darling ere the sun sets o'er the barley
W: And I'll meet you there, on the road to Drumslieve
W: 
W: Bridget O'Malley, you've left my heart shaken
W: With a hopeless desolation, I'll have you to know
W: It's the wonders of adoration you're quiet face has taken
W: And your beauty will haunt me, wherever I go

W: When I was in service in Rosemary Lane
W: I won the good favor of master and dame
W: Until a sailor came by one night for to call
W: And that was the beginning of my downfall
W: 
W: He called for a candle to light him to bed
W: And likewise a silk hankerchief to tie up his hair
W: To tie up his hair as sailors will do,
W: "And third my pretty Polly, will you come too?"
W: 
W: Now this may seem young and foolish, she thought it no harm
W: To lie on the bed to keep herself warm
W: And what was done there, I shall never disclose
W: But I wish that short night had been seven long years

W: And into my pockets 3 guineas did throw

W: If you'll be my Polly wherever I go"
W:

W: There were three auld gypsies came to our hall door.
W: They came brave and boldly-o.
W: And one sang high and the other sang low
W: And the other sang a raggle taggle gypsy-o.
W: 
W: It was upstairs, downstairs the lady went,
W: Put on her suit of leather-o,
W: And it was the cry all around her door;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: It was late that night when the lord came in,
W: Enquiring for his lady-o,
W: And the servant girl’s reply to him was;
W: “She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Then saddle for me my milk-white steed
W: Me big horse is not speedy-o
W: And I will ride and I’ll seek me bride,
W: She’s away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: He rode east and he rode west
W: He rode north and south also,
W: And when he rode to the wide open field
W: It was there that he spied his lady-o.
W: 
W: “Arra, why did you leave your house and your land,
W: Why did you leave your money-o?
W: Why did you leave your only wedded lord
W: All for the raggle taggle gypsy-o?”
W: 
W: “Yerra what do I care for me house and me land?
W: What do I care for money-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “It was there last night you’d a goose feather bed,
W: Blankets drawn so comely-o.
W: But tonight you lie in a wide open field
W: In the arms of the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Yerra, what do I care for me goose feather bed?
W: Yerra, what do I care for blankets-o?
W: What do I care for me only wedded lord?
W: I’m away with the raggle taggle gypsy-o”
W: 
W: “Oh, for you rode east when I rode west,
W: You rode high and I rode low.
W: I’d rather have a kiss of the yellow gypsy’s lips
W: Than all the cash and money-o”

W: The water is wide, I cannot get oer
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: Give me a boat that can carry two
W: And both shall row, my love and I
W: 
W: A ship there is and she sails the sea
W: She's loaded deep as deep can be
W: But not so deep as the love I'm in
W: I know not if I sink or swim
W: 
W: I leaned my back against an oak
W: Thinking it was a trusty tree
W: But first it bent and then it broke
W: So did my love prove false to me
W: 
W: I reached my finger into some soft bush
W: Thinking the fairest flower to find
W: I pricked my finger to the bone
W: And left the fairest flower behind
W: 
W: Oh love be handsome and love be kind
W: Gay as a jewel when first it is new
W: But love grows old and waxes cold
W: And fades away like the morning dew
W: 
W: Must I go bound while you go free
W: Must I love a man who doesn't love me
W: Must I be born with so little art
W: As to love a man who'll break my heart
W: 
W: When cockle shells turn silver bells
W: Then will my love come back to me
W: When roses bloom in winter's gloom
W: Then will my love return to me

W: In another younger day I could dream the time away
W: In the universe inside my room
W: And the world was really mine from june til september
W: And if it wasn't really so I was lucky not to know
W: And I was lucky not to wonder why
W: Because the summer time is all that I remember
W: 
W: A summer fly was buzzin' every night when I was young
W: In the gentle world my childlike senses knew
W: And the world was just my cousin
W: And the wind was just the tongue
W: In the voice my lonely moments listened to
W: 
W: And I look at me today all the dreams have gone away
W: And I'm where I never thought I would be
W: Seein' things I never thought I would see happen'en to me
W: And I lay awake at night til the darkness turns to light
W: Hearin' voices callin' out my name
W: Dronin' over and again the same message to me
W: 
W: Cryin' who's your partner, who's your darlin', who's
W: Your baby now?
W: Who wakes up at night to pull you in
W: But it don't matter, you'll just make her lonely anyhow
W: I don't know why you even try to win

W: Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
W: Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day  is  done

W: A holiday, a holiday
W: And the first one of the year
W: Lord Donald's wife came into the church
W: The gospel for to hear
W: 
W: And when the meeting it was done
W: She cast her eyes about
W: And there she saw little Matty Groves
W: Walking in the crowd
W: 
W: "Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: Come home with me tonight
W: Come home with me, little Matty Groves
W: And sleep with me 'til light"
W: "Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home
W: And sleep with you tonight
W: By the rings on your fingers I can tell
W: You are Lord Donald's wife"
W: 
W: "What if I am Lord Donald's wife?
W: Lord Donald's not at home
W: He is out in the far cornfields
W: Bringing the yearlings home"
W: 
W: And a servant who was standing by
W: And hearing what was said
W: He swore Lord Donald he would know
W: Before the sun would set
W: 
W: And in his hurry to carry the news
W: He bent his breast and ran
W: And when he came to the broad millstream
W: He took off his shoes and swam
W: 
W: Little Matty Groves, he lay down
W: And took a little sleep
W: When he awoke, Lord Donald
W: Was standing at his feet
W: 
W: Saying "How do you like my feather bed
W: And how do you like my sheets?
W: How do you like my lady
W: Who lies in your arms asleep?"
W: 
W: "Oh, well I like your feather bed
W: And well I like your sheets
W: But better I like your lady gay
W: Who lies in my arms asleep"
W: 
W: "Well, get up, get up," Lord Donald cried
W: "Get up as quick as you can
W: It'll never be said in fair England
W: I slew a naked man"
W: 
W: "Oh, I can't get up, I won't get up
W: I can't get up for my life
W: For you have two long beaten swords
W: And I not a pocket knife"
W: 
W: "Well it's true I have two beaten swords
W: And they cost me deep in the purse
W: But you will have the better of them
W: And I will have the worse
W: 
W: And you will strike the very first blow
W: And strike it like a man
W: I will strike the very next blow
W: And I'll kill you if I can"
W: 
W: So Matty struck the very first blow
W: And he hurt Lord Donald sore
W: Lord Donald struck the very next blow
W: And Matty struck no more
W: 
W: And then Lord Donald he took his wife
W: And he sat her on his knee
W: Saying "Who do you like the best of us
W: Matty Groves or me?"
W: 
W: And then up spoke his own dear wife
W: Never heard to speak so free
W: "I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips
W: Than you or your finery".
W: 
W: Lord Donald he jumped up
W: And loudly he did bawl
W: He struck his wife right through the heart
W: And pinned her against the wall
W: 
W: "A grave, a grave," Lord Donald cried
W: "To put these lovers in

W: [Verse 1]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young girl calling
W: Michael they are taking you away
W: For you stole Trevelyans corn
W: So the young might see the morn
W: Now a prison ship lay waiting in the bay
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: By a lonely prison wall
W: I heard a young man calling
W: Nothing matters Mary when you're free
W: Against the famine and the crown
W: I rebelled they cut me down
W: Now you must raise our child with dignity
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: Low lie the fields of Athenry
W: Where once we watched the small free birds fly
W: Our love was on the wing
W: We had Dreams and songs to sing
W: It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: By a lonely harbour wall
W: She watched the last star falling
W: As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
W: For she lives to hope and pray
W: For her love in Botany bay
W: It's so lonely around the fields of Athenry

W: Lay down your head, on a soft river bed
W: Sonny always remembers the words Mamma says.
W: 
W: Sonny don't go away, I'm here all alone

W: With her opal robes serene
W: In the lamplight shimmering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W:

W: On a blue jay morning
W: Feathering thorny memories
W: Hail home, hearts have been too long away
W: On a well-worn byway travelling
W: Magpie gathering
W: Farewell queen of waters
W: 
W: Well it’s hard to roll in mirth,
W: When your feet don’t touch the earth
W: And the wolf comes hungering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land
W: 
W: Folly never foots the bill
W: And we all shall pay in full
W: For a love of melody
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: But I danced until the dawn
W: Like an ant grass - hoppering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: Well there must be better ways
W: For to keep their debts at bay
W: And the whisky trickling
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: So we’ll bid our ship adieu
W: There’s a mooring in the blue
W: Where the gulls are gathering
W: Hail home, hearts that long for the land

W: Only in our reverie

W: My song for you this evening, it's not to make you sad
W: Nor for adding to the sorrows of our troubled northern land
W: But lately I've been thinking and it just won't leave my mind
W: I'll tell you of two friends one time who were both good friends of mine
W: 
W: Isaac he was Protestant and Sean was Catholic born
W: But it never made a difference, for the friendship it was strong
W: And sometimes in the evening when we heard the sound of drums
W: We said it won't divide us, we will always be as one
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: It was on a Sunday morning when the awful news came round
W: 
W: Another killing had been done just outside Newry Town
W: We knew that Isaac danced up there, we knew he liked the band
W: But when we heard that he was dead we just could not understand
W: Now fear it filled the countryside there was fear in every home
W: When late at night a car came prowling round the Ryan Road
W: A Catholic would be killed tonight to even up the score
W: Oh Christ it's young McDonald they have taken from the door
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: 
W: I don't know where the moral is or where this song should end
W: But I wonder just how many wars are fought between good friends
W: And those who give the orders are not the ones to die
W: It's Scott and young McDonald and the likes of you and I
W: 
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together
W: There were roses, roses
W: There were roses
W: And the tears of a people ran together

W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
W: There are frail forms fainting at the door:
W: Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say –
W: Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W: 
W: Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
W: While we all sup sorrow with the poor:
W: There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
W: With a worn heart whose better days are o’er:
W: Though her voice would be merry, ’tis sighing all the day –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days have lingered around my cab in door;
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
W: ‘ Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore,
W: ‘ Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave, –
W: Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.
W: 
W: ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary;
W: Hard Times, Hard Times, come again no more:
W: Many days you have lingered around my cabin door;
W: ​Oh! Hard Times, come again no more.

W: The changes that have come over me
W: In these last few days I've been afraid
W: That I might drift away
W: 
W: So I've been telling old stories, singing songs
W: That make me think about where I came from
W: And that's the reason why I seem
W: So far away today
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Oh and I have moved and I've kept on moving
W: Proved the points that I needed proving
W: Lost the friends that I needed losing
W: Found others on the way
W: 
W: Oh and I have tried and kept on trying
W: Stolen dreams yes there's no denying
W: I have traveled far with conscience flying
W: Somewhere with the wind
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home
W: If I should become a stranger
W: You know that it would make me more than sad
W: Caledonia's been everything
W: I've ever had
W: 
W: Now I'm sitting here before the fire
W: The empty room, the forest choir
W: The flames that could not get any higher
W: They've withered now they've gone
W: 
W: But I'm steady thinking my way is clear
W: And I know what I will do tomorrow
W: When the hands are shaken and the kisses flow
W: Then I will disappear
W: 
W: Oh, but let me tell you that I love you
W: That I think about you all the time
W: Caledonia you're calling me
W: And now I'm going home

W: Soar Black Head against the sky
W: Between the rocks that run down to the sea
W: 
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Talking all the day with true friends, who try to make you stay
W: Telling jokes and news, singing songs to pass the night away
W: 
W: Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun
W: Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets, asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play
W: 
W: Someone touched the bow, he played a reel, it seemed so fine and gay
W: Stood on Dingle beach and cast, in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland
W: 
W: Dreaming in the night, I saw a land where no man had to fight
W: Waking in your dawn, I saw you crying in the morning light
W: Lying where the Falcons fly, they twist and turn all in you e'er blue sky
W: Living on your western shore, saw summer sunsets asked for more
W: 
W: I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland

W: 
W: The cobbler he rose and he soon let her in, his arm
W: And his hammer were neat as a pin
W: And he had the will for the greet her son slim
W: With a kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Oh cobbler oh cobbler tis soon we’ll be wed
W: And nestling together in a fine feather bed
W: So give me too shoes with buckles of red
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: The maid hid the shoes in the back of her waist,
W: She praised his good cobbling and shoemakers taste
W: And home to her father, she mournfully faced
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O father oh father I have got me a man
W: And he is the one I would web if I can
W: As handsome as ever in leather did stand
W: For me kiss in the morning early
W: 
W: Her father was thinking and thinking again
W: For to wed her to riches and have them for him
W: Who knows but it might be a prince or a king,
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: Who knows that it might be a jobber from town,
W: Or a wealthy sea captain who sails the world round?
W: A man with some thousands and thousands of pounds
W: That she met in the morning early
W: 
W: So the father was smiling the daughter embraced,
W: And touching the buckles he drew back in haste
W: He spied the red shoes that were tied round her waist
W: For it was in the morning early
W: 
W: O daughter o daughter he started to shout,
W: When he did discover what she was about
W: God knows it was one but that old cobbling clout.
W: That she met in the morning early

W: I wish I was in Carrickfergus
W: Only for nights in Ballygrand
W: I would swim over the deepest ocean
W: The deepest ocean for my love to find
W: 
W: But the sea is wide and I cannot swim over
W: Neither have I wings to fly
W: If I could find me a handsome boatsman
W: To ferry me over to my love and die
W: 
W: My childhood days bring back sad reflections
W: Of happy times spent so long ago
W: My childhood friends and my own relations
W: Have all passed on now like melting snow
W: 
W: But I'll spend my days in endless roaming
W: Soft is the grass, my bed is free
W: Ah, to be back now in Carrickfergus
W: On that long road down to the sea
W: 
W: I'll spend my days in endless roaming
W: Soft is the grass, my bed is free
W: But I am sick now, and my days are numbered
W: Come all you young men and lay me down

W: Wi’ yer heid held high though yer heart was sair
W: And ye bid farewell forever mair

W: Noo an English lord in a tartan plaid

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Your presence is requested, wrote little Johnny White
W: But with this invitation, there is a stipulation.
W: When you attend this party, you'll all be treated right,
W: But there's a wild and woolly woman you boys can't invite.
W: 
W: You can bring Pearl, she's a darn nice girl, But don't bring Lulu!
W: You can bring Rose with the turned-up nose, But don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu always wants to do, what the folks don't want her to
W: When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down!
W: 
W: You can bring cake or a porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu gets blue and goes cuckoo, like the clock upon the shelf.
W: She's the kind of smarty breaks up every party, Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself!
W: 
W: Last week we had a party, a real high-toned affair
W: And then along came Lulu, wild as any Zulu.
W: She started in to Charleston, and how the boys did stare,
W: But when she did the hula-hula, then she got the air.
W: 
W: You can bring Flo, her dad's got dough, But don't bring Lulu!
W: You can bring Lil, she's an awful pill, But don't bring Lulu!
W: 
W: Lulu has the reddest hair, redder here and redder there.
W: How can we boys keep our heads, bulls go wild when they see red
W: You can bring peas and crackers and cheese, but don't bring Lulu!
W: 
W: When she gets sore and slams the door, the plates fly off the shelf
W: She can make a feller wild on sarsaparilla, Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, She'll come here herself.
W: 
W: You can bring ham and crackers and jam, but don't bring Lulu!
W: Lulu goes wild, and when she's wild, she climbs upon the shelf!
W: She can make a pastor be a dancing master, Hullabaloo-loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself!

W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while?
W: And a maiden all the while, and a maiden all the while?
W: For to think I was a sailor and a maiden all the while
W: 
W: Well, they sent me off to London for to guard the Tower?
W: And I'm sure I might be there 'til my very dying hour
W: ?But a lady fell in love with me, I told her I was a maid?

B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Galileo's head was on the block
W: The crime was looking up for truth
W: And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode
W: I try to trace them to my youth
W: 
W: And then you had to bring up reincarnation
W: Over a couple of beers the other night
W: And now I'm serving time for mistakes
W: Made by another in another lifetime
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
W: I call on the resting soul of galileo
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: And then I think about my fear of motion
W: Which I never could explain
W: Some other fool across the ocean years ago
W: Must have crashed his little airplane
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach that kind of light
W: I call on the resting soul of galileo
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: I'm not making a joke, you know me
W: I take everything so seriously
W: If we wait for the time till all souls get it right
W: Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation
W: In my lifetime I'm still not right
W: 
W: I offer thanks to those before me
W: That's all I've got to say
W: 'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime
W: Now I have to pay
W: But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration
W: To let the next life off the hook
W: But she'll say "look what I had to overcome from my last life
W: I think I'll write a book"
W: 
W: How long till my soul gets it right
W: Can any human being ever reach the highest light
W: Except for Galileo God rest his soul
W: (Except for the resting soul of Galileo)
W: King of night vision, king of insight
W: 
W: How long
W: (Till my soul gets it right)
W: [Til we reach the highest light]
W: How long

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: As I was walking one midsummer's morning,
W: To hear the birds whistle and the nightingale play,
W: Was there that I met a beautiful maiden,
W: As I was a walking along the highway.
W: 
W: Oh where are you going my fair pretty lady,
W: Where are you going so early this morn,
W: She answered, kind sir to visit my neighbours,
W: I'm going down to Lincoln the place I was born.
W: 
W: Oh may I go with you my fair pretty lady,
W: May I go along in your sweet company,
W: She turned her head round and smiling all at me,
W: Said you may come with me kind sir if you please.
W: 
W: We hadn't been walking a few miles together,
W: Before this young damsel began to show free,
W: She sat herself down saying sit down beside me,
W: The game we shall play will be one, two and three.
W: 
W: I said my dear lady if you're fond of the gaming,
W: There's one game I know I would like you to learn,
W: The game it is called The Game Of All Fours,
W: So I took out my pack and began the first turn.
W: 
W: She cut the cards and I fell a dealing,
W: I dealt her a trump and myself the poor Jack,
W: She led off here ace and stole the Jack from me,
W: Saying Jack is the card I like best in your pack.
W: 
W: I dealt the last time, its your turn to shuffle,
W: My turn to show the best card in the pack,
W: Once more she'd the ace and stole the Jack from me,
W: Once more I lost when I laid down poor Jack.
W: 
W: So I took up my hat and I bid her good morning,
W: I said you're the best that I know at this game,
W: She answered, young man, come back tomorrow,
W: We'll play the game over and over and over and over and over again

W: When I wake from dreaming, in the middle of the night
W: You're asleep and yet you say In your own sweet silent way
W: That everything's alright
W: 
W: And your hair is lying , across the pillow by my head
W: You're unconscious to the night
W: You can't talk but that's all right
W: Let your breathing speak instead
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I hear you breathing in
W: You breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: Well, I don't turn on the light
W: I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me
W: 
W: Senses can deceive me , when I'm sleepy and confused
W: From my heavy eyes I see , only darkness around me
W: My dreams long since excused.
W: Then my thoughts go racing , through the cloisters of my brain
W: In those midnight hours I find , that you hypnotize my mind
W: With your soothing pulse again
W: I hear you breathing in,  you breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: I don't turn on the light , I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I hear you breathing in
W: You breathe out on my skin
W: That's when I begin  to know you're near me
W: Well, I don't turn on the light
W: I don't need to use my eyes
W: The heartbeat by my side , tells me you're here with me

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I'll take you home again, Kathleen
W: Across the ocean wild and wide
W: To where your heart has ever been
W: Since you were first my bonnie bride.
W: The roses all have left your cheek.
W: I've watched them fade away and die
W: Your voice is sad when e'er you speak
W: And tears bedim your loving eyes.
W: Oh! I will take you back, Kathleen
W: To where your heart will feel no pain
W: And when the fields are fresh and green
W: I'II take you to your home again!
W: 
W: I know you love me, Kathleen, dear
W: Your heart was ever fond and true.
W: I always feel when you are near
W: That life holds nothing, dear, but you.
W: The smiles that once you gave to me
W: I scarcely ever see them now
W: Though many, many times I see
W: A dark'ning shadow on your brow.
W: 
W: To that dear home beyond the sea
W: My Kathleen shall again return.
W: And when thy old friends welcome thee
W: Thy loving heart will cease to yearn.
W: Where laughs the little silver stream
W: Beside your mother's humble cot
W: And brightest rays of sunshine gleam
W: There all your grief will be forgot.

W: I kicked in his door at five a.m.,
W: "I've come for my bike" I told the repo man.
W: My 920's gonna take me far today,
W: You can travel for miles and never leave L.A.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I drive by the Plaza where the gay boys pose,
W: Stand in their windows wearing no clothes.
W: I heard the screams of the dying dark,
W: Through the sweet green icing of MacArthur Park.
W: And then I crossed the river into East L.A.
W: Pescado mojado me encontre.
W: And I've giving up on rock 'n roll,
W: And I'm saving up for norteno.
W: The river she runs by the railroad tracks,
W: I swear I'll never take it back.
W: A train, she cries on the midnight hour,
W: All along the Watts Tower.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: I gunned it down to San Pedro Bay,
W: Watched my ship sail in, watched her sail away.
W: The sun was sinking into the sea.
W: But a ball of fire inside of me,
W: Was burning my motor and driving me hard,
W: Past the big hair on the Boulevard.
W: And up Mulholland where I made the scene,
W: Like the one that took little Jimmy Dean.
W: And then I shimmied up Wilshire like a little silk worm,
W: Past the rodeo and the pachyderm.
W: And then I stopped for coffee at an art cafe,
W: I saw the repo man and made my getaway.
W: Doing the Eagle Rock,
W: Heading for the hills.
W: Oh try to let my engines cool.
W: And it is not my fault that this town shakes,
W: I saw the falling rock and I hit my brakes.
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: Now you tow it to the repo man's front door,
W: And you give him these keys, I don't need them no more.
W: You tow it to the repo man's front door,

W: You don't have to worry.  She died very quickly, remember her in your prayers.
W: And it's so good to hear that Michael's returning, with money he's sure to buy land.
W: For the crop has been poor and the people are selling for any price that they can.
W: 
W: Kilkelly, Ireland, 18 and 90, my dear and loving son John
W: I guess that I must be close on to eighty, It's thirty years since you're gone.

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: \Someone is tossing petals in a stream
W: Somewhere someone standing at
W: At the foothills of their dreams
W: Someone got a paintbrush,
W: Is painting over doubts
W: Someone opened up his eyes and
W: Saw the sun coming out
W: Someone was captive and found the courage to get off
W: From a boulder in well, somewhere the
W: Rain has stopped
W: Someone is finding the place where they belong
W: 
W: Everyday is summer
W: Somewhere in the world
W: Summer boys are headed for the falls
W: To kiss the girls
W: With their impatient hands groping honey breasts and curls
W: They are filled with desire
W: And high in the hills there's a baby being born
W: As forgiveness and peace wash over bruises sores
W: People bridging the distance over nettles and thorns
W: {c: CHORUS}
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
W: If the faucet is tightened up the love won't flow
W: If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
W: If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow
W: 
W: A rich man counting money, a tired man counting sheep
W: While the safe man counts his blessings, the hungry man has beans
W: There's a million people praying, raising up their eyes
W: To what turns out to be the same god, the same sky
W: We are slightly scared of death, a little bit afraid
W: So we celebrate everything we can think to celebrate
W: We shall sing out loud to keep the hounds away
W: 
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line
W: If the facuet is tightened up the love won't flow
W: If the love isn't bright enough the corn won't grow
W: If the night isn't dark enough the moon won't glow
W: 
W: Prisons will crumble and governments will fall
W: It's the order of freedom to be preceded by walls
W: Cause the truth would be worthless if no one ever lied
W: So we carry our shame in the interest of pride
W: And we have all these questions to make us go roamÊ
W: And weÕve got all this distance to make us come home
W: As the sun burns, a child learns, the tide churns, the world turns
W: 
W: Everyone aboard on the merry-go-round
W: Some things will rise up so that others come down
W: If the devil don't dance, heaven won't shine
W: It's a mighty thick haze and it's a pretty thin line

T: My Old Kentucky Home
C:Stephen Foster
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: "My Old Kentucky Home," originally titled "Poor Uncle Tom, Good Night!," is the state song of Kentucky.
W: 
W: The facts surrounding the composition of this song point to the influence of Uncle Tom's Cabin rather than a visit to Kentucky. Foster may or may not have visited his cousins in Bardstown, Kentucky at their mansion Federal Hill, but the original sketch of this song, dating from 1852, substitutes "Poor Uncle Tom" for "My Old Kentucky Home" and aligns Foster's sympathies with the Abolitionist movement.
W: =========================
W: 
W: Verse 1:
W: The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,
W: ‘Tis summer, the darkies are gay;
W: The corn-top’s ripe and the meadow’s in the bloom,
W: While the birds make music all the day.
W: The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,
W: All merry, all happy and bright;
W: By ‘n’ by Hard Times comes a-knocking at the door,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus:
W: Weep no more my lady
W: Oh! weep no more today!
W: We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home,
W: For the Old Kentucky Home far away.
W: 
W: Verse 2:
W: They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,
W: On meadow, the hill and the shore,
W: They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,
W: On the bench by the old cabin door.
W: The day goes by like a shadow o’er the heart,
W: With sorrow, where all was delight,
W: The time has come when the darkies have to part,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus
W: 
W: Verse 3:
W: The head must bow and the back will have to bend,
W: Wherever the darky may go;
W: A few more days, and the trouble all will end,
W: In the field where the sugar-canes grow;
W: A few more days for to tote the weary load,
W: No matter, ’twill never be light;
W: A few more days till we totter on the road,
W: Then my old Kentucky home, goodnight.
W: 
W: Chorus

C:Andy Irvine
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: I was just a small town country boy
W: When I left that country town
W: Route 66 to the Westward
W: And hopped an old freight down
W: California here I come
W: By the side door Pullman and the sunburnt thumb
W: And they called us Okies, lowdown bums
W: And the police on us frowned
W: 
W: {c: Chorus}
W: Never tire of the road
W: Never tire of the rolling wheel
W: Never tire of the ways of the world
W: Way out yonder is a-calling me
W: And the dark road leads me onwards
W: And the highway, that's my code
W: And the lonesome voice that I heard said
W: Never tire of the road
W: 
W: California to the New York Island
W: Me and my guitar
W: And we played in many a hobo jungle
W: Many a skid row bar
W: Standing out in the wind and the rain
W: That lonesome whistle is a sweet refrain
W: When you are waiting for some old freight train
W: That carries an empty car.
W: 
W: Don't let them ever fool you
W: Or take you by surprise
W: That dirty smell of a politician
W: And the man with the greed in his eyes
W: One big union, that's our plan
W: And the IWW"s your only man
W: The flames of discontent we'll fan
W: For the cause that never dies

W: My poor feet have travelled this hot dusty road?
W: Out of your dustbowl and westward we roam?
W: Through deserts so hot and through mountains so cold
W: 
W: I've wandered all over your green, growing land?
W: Wherever your crops are, I'll lend you my hand?
W: On the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then?
W: I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind
W: 
W: California, Arizona, I've worked on your crops?
W: And northward up to Oregon to gather your hops?
W: I've dug beets from the ground, I've cut grapes from the vine?
W: To set at your table that white sparkling wine
W: 
W: Green pastures of plenty from the dry desert ground?
W: From the grand Coolie dam where the waters run down?
W: In every state of this union we migrants have been?
W: We work on the land and we'll fight until we win

W: All along your green valleys I'll work 'til I die?

W: Didn't I rock her well?

W: [G]She looked at me with eyes atwinkle, her c[C]heeks a lovely [D]rosy h[G]ue.
W: [G]"Thank you kindly, sir," she answered, th[C]en she tossed her bright red hair,

W: 
W: [G]When we reached the town of Dingle, I [C]took her hand to say goodbye,
W: [G]A traveller he stepped up behind me and [C]hit me right in [D]my left e[G]ye.
W: [G]Now I was feeling kind of peevish, [C]my poor eye felt sad and sore
W: [G]I tapped him gently with my hobnails, and he [C]flew back through M[D]urphy's doo[G]r.
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in the m[D]arriage [G]bed.
W: 
W: [G]He galloped off to find his father, the t[C]allest man I e'er did meet
W: [G]He tapped me gently with his knuckles, n[C]ow I am minus t[D]wo front te[G]eth.
W: [G]Round the corner came a peeler, to[C]ld me that I'd broke the law
W: [G]The donkey kicked him in the kneecap, [C]he fell down and b[D]roke his ja[G]w.
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary
W: [C]Her and I are to be wed,
W: We're [G]seein' the priest this very morning
W: [C]Tonight we'll lie in the m[D]arriage [G]bed.
W: 
W: [G]Now the red-haired girl she kept on smiling, "I'll [C]come along with you" she said
W: [G]"We'll forget the priest this very morning, and tonig[C]ht we'll sleep in [D]Murphy's sh[G]ed
W: 
W: [G]Keep your hands off red-haired Mary

W: Rammed his head in a pail of water
W: Fired his pistols into the air
W: A damned sight quicker than I married his daughter

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: Young Roger the miller came courting of late
W: To a farmer's fine daughter called beautiful Kate
W: She had for her fortune a many fine things
W: Beautiful silks and gold, diamonds and rings
W: Her father, he gave her a neat plot of ground
W: She had also a fortune, she had also a fortune of five hundred pounds
W: 
W: Then the money and supper, they both were laid down
W: Well, it was a great sight to see five hundred pounds
W: The sight of that money and beauty likewise
W: Made Roger's heart greedy and dazzled his eyes
W: "Now that your daughter and money is here
W: 'Tis I will not have her, 'tis I will not have her without that gray mare"
W: 
W: Then the money and supper were taken from sight
W: And likewise young Kathy, his own heart's delight
W: Roger was taken and shown out the door
W: And ordered not for to come there anymore
W: 'Twas then he did tear at his long yellow hair
W: Saying, "I wish I had never, I wish I had never spoke of that gray mare"
W: 
W: Now it was when six months, they were over and past
W: And Roger the miller, he met with his lass
W: "I think I do know you then, madam," said he
W: "I am the same way with you, sir," said she
W: "A man with your features with fine yellow hair
W: Oh he once came a-courting, he once came a-courting my father's gray mare"
W: 
W: "Well, it was not a-courting the gray mare I came
W: But you, my own jewel, my Kathy by name
W: I thought that your father would never dispute
W: To give me the gray mare with you to boot
W: And not to risk lose such a dutiful son
W: Oh it's now I am sorry, it's now I am sorry for what I have done"
W: 
W: "For your sorrow, young Roger, I have little regard
W: For there's plenty of men in this town to be had
W: If you forgot the gray mare, you'd be married, you see
W: But now you have neither the gray mare nor me
W: The price of that mare, it was never so great
W: Oh fare you well, Roger, oh fare you well, Roger, you're a sorrowful state"
W: 
W: Now Roger's away to his desolate home
W: And he sighs as he sits there and sups all alone
W: Kathy, she sings, she is happy and gay
W: She has wed a young miller who works the long day
W: Lads, when you're courting, be always aware
W: To court with a young maid, to court with a young maid and not the gray mare

W: Thrown off the bridge to the river by the bridge was the iron mountain baby. A man walking by said he heard a little cry and he found him in a suitcase.
W: 
W: Fifty feet down from the train to the ground it's a miracle that he survived. What are the chances that a man would be standin' there and take him home to his wife.
W: 
W: Sarah Jane Sarah Jane Be a mama to the boy from the train
W: 
W: Five days old with a hand that could hold in a grip around your finger. Old Sarah Jane no she never did complain 'cause she loved the little Stranger.
W: 
W: She brought him back to health and she kept him for herself when some women tried to claim him. "If you'd been a good mama then you never would've wanna gone and thrown him off of the train then".
W: 
W: A picture in the paper showed the baby like an angel with the savior and the suitcase. What kind of devil could have thrown the little fellow off the train in the first place.
W: 
W: His mama musta died givin' birth to the child and the daddy went crazy. Got on the train with a heart full of pain and took it out on the baby.
W: 
W: Sarah Jane Sarah Jane Be a mama to the boy from the train
W: Woo oo baby! Woo oo you're my baby now
W: 
W: A civil war vet went to see if he could get a bit of timber for a new barn. The number 4 sped from the train overhead came the itty bitty newborn.

W: Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, and think of you
W: Caught up in circles confusion is nothing new
W: Flashback, warm nights, almost left behind
W: Suitcases of memories, time after--
W: 
W: Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
W: You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
W: Then you say, go slow, I fall behind, the second hand unwinds
W: 
W: If you're lost you can look--and you will find me, time after time
W: if you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting, time after time
W: 
W: After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
W: Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
W: Secrets stolen from deep inside the drum beats out of time--
W: 
W: you said go slow, I fall behind, the second hand unwinds--

W: I should have know that you were gone back in Germany

W: And all that I had heard were our hearts beating

W: While this love has a voice that we both can hear
W: Before you let it go
W: The greatest love I've ever known
W: Won't you please talk to me while I'm listening
W: 
W: I cannot find a place to put this love away
W: Or lost the thought of sunlight on your face
W: I thought I heard your voice
W: Say I love today
W: But it was only the sound of my heart breaking
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: 
W: How I wish that I could take us back to Germany
W: And I would stay awake and you would talk to me
W: Yet for every drop of rain I hear
W: There's bound to fall another tear
W: Upon this page of song of my heart aching

W: As fame reports a young duke kept a court
W: He pleased himself with his frolicsome sport
W: He found a poor tinker lying drunk on the ground
W: In such a deep sleep he heard not a sound
W: 
W: He said to his men, Richard, William, and Ben
W: We'll away to my palace and we'll sport with him then
W: He was carefully carried to the palace so grand
W: None would compare in all of this land
W: 
W: They stripped him down bare and he had not a care
W: They washed down his body, his face and his hair
W: They put on a nightgown of bright crimson and red
W: And left him to sleep in the duke's golden bed
W: 
W: In the morning when day, then admiring he lay
W: For to see the rich chamber both gaudy and gay
W: He looked all around him and was so amazed
W: And admired how he to this honor was raised
W: 
W: Though he seemed somewhat mute, he chose a rich suit
W: Which he straightway put on without longer dispute
W: From a place of convenience, the duke his good grace
W: Observed the man, in every case
W: 
W: A fine dinner was dressed both for him and his guests
W: He was placed at the table above all the rest
W: He had wine, he had brandy and soon he did snore
W: Being seven times drunker than ever before
W: 
W: Then the duke did ordain they should strip him again
W: And restore him to a tinker, and to ever remain
W: Again he was carried to the side of the road
W: Back once again where they first found their load
W: 
W: He slept all the night as indeed he well might
W: But when he did waken his joys took their flight
W: Oh the power and the glory so pleasant did seem
W: He thought it to be but a mere golden dream

Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: One fine winter's morn my horn I did blow
W: To the green fields of Keady for hours we did go
W: We gathered our dogs and we circled around
W: For none loves the sport better than the boys in the dell.
W: 
W: And when we arrived they were all standing there
W: We set off for the fields, boys, in search of a hare
W: We didn't get far till someone gave the cheer
W: Over high hills and valleys the sweet puss did steer
W: 
W: As we flew o'er the hills, 'twas a beautiful sight
W: There was dogs black and yellow, there was dogs black and white
W: As she took the black bank for to try them once more
W: Oh it was her last look o'er the hills of Greenmore.
W: 
W: In a field of wheat stubble this pussy did lie
W: And Rory and Charmer they did pass her by
W: And there where we stood at the top of the brae
W: We heard the last words that this sweet puss did say:
W: 
W: No more o'er the green fields of Keady I'll roam
W: Nor trip through the fields, boys, in sport and in fun
W: Or hear the long horn that your toner does play
W: I'll go home to my den by the clear light of day.
W: 
W: You may blame ol' MacMahon for killing the hare
W: For he's at his ol' capers this many's a year
W: On Saturday and Sunday he never gives o'er
W: With a pack of strange dogs round the hills of Greenmore

C:Phil Coulter
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: In my memory, I will always see
W: The town that I have loved so well
W: Where our school played ball by the old gas yard wall
W: And they laughed through the smoke and the smell
W: Going home in the rain, running up the dark lane
W: Past the jail, and down behind the Fountain
W: Those were happy days in so many, many ways
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: In the early morning the shirt factory horn
W: Called women from Creggan, the moor, and the bog
W: While the men on the dole played a mother's role
W: Fed the children and then walked the dog
W: And when times got tough there was just about enough
W: And they saw it through without complaining
W: For deep inside was a burning pride
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: There was music there in the Derry air
W: Like a language that we all could understand
W: I remember the day that I earned my first pay
W: When I played in a small pick-up band
W: There I spent my youth, and to tell you the truth
W: I was sad to leave it all behind me
W: For I learned about life, and I found a wife
W: In the town I loved so well
W: 
W: But when I returned, how my eyes have burned
W: To see how a town could be brought to it's knees
W: By the armoured cars and the bombed-out bars
W: And the gas that hangs on to every breeze
W: Now the army's installed by that old gas yard wall
W: And the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher
W: With their tanks and their guns, oh my god, what have they done
W: To the town I loved so well
W: 
W: Now the music's gone but they carry on
W: For their spirits been bruised, never broken
W: They will not forget but their hearts are set
W: On tomorrow and peace once again
W: For what's done is done and what's won is won
W: And what's lost is lost and gone for ever
W: I can only pray for a bright, brand new day
W: In the town I love so well

W: The kings shilling (A)
W: 
W: Oh my love has left me with bairnes twa
W: And that's the last of him I ever saw
W: He joined the army and marched to war
W: He took the shilling, he took the shilling and he's off to war
W: 
W: Well, did he look as he marched along
W: With his kilt and sporran and his musket gun?
W: The ladies tipped him as he marched along
W: He sailed out by, he sailed out by the Broomielaw
W: 
W: Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
W: Take the king's shilling and you're off to war
W: 
W: Pipes did play as he marched along
W: And the soldiers sang out a battle song
W: "March on, march on," cried the captain gay
W: For king and country, for king and country we will fight today
W: 
W: Well, the battle rattled to the sound of guns
W: And the bayonets flashed in the morning sun
W: The drums did beat and the cannon roared and the shilling didn't seem,
W: Oh the shilling didn't seem much worth the war
W: 
W: Well, the men they fought and the men did fall
W: Cut down by bayonet and musket ball
W: Many of these brave young men
W: Would never fight for, would never fight for the king again
W: 
W: Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
W: Take the king's shilling and you'll die in war...

W: I've had it now for more damn years
W: Than I can count anyway
W: I wear it beneath my jacket
W: With the collar turned up high
W: So old I should replace it
W: But I'm not about to try
W: 
W: This shirt's got silver buttons
W: And a place upon the sleeve
W: Where I used to set my heart up
W: Right there anyone could see
W: This shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance
W: Where the boys ignored the girls
W: And we all pretended to like the band
W: 
W: This shirt was a pillow for my head
W: On a train through Italy
W: This shirt was a blanket beneath the love
W: We made in Argeles
W: This shirt was lost for three whole days
W: In a town near Buffalo
W: 'Till I found the locker key
W: In a downtown Trailways bus depot
W: 
W: 
W: This shirt was the one I lent you
W: And when you gave it back
W: There was a rip inside the sleeve
W: Where you rolled your cigarettes
W: It was the place I put my heart
W: Now look at where you put a tear
W: I forgave your thoughtlessness
W: But not the boy who put it there
W: 
W: This shirt was the place your cat
W: Decided to give birth to five
W: And we stayed up all night watching
W: And we wept when the last one died
W: This shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton
W: Shining like the memories
W: Inside those silver buttons
W: 
W: This shirt is a grand old relic
W: With a grand old history
W: I wear it now for Sunday chores
W: Cleaning house and raking leaves
W: I wear it beneath my jacket
W: With the collar turned up high
W: So old I should replace it
W: But I'm not about to try

W: 
W: The season came and went without a letter to explain
W: Why all the trains would roll in empty and then roll back pout again
W: 
W: He saw Hank Williams step down from the Georgia and Patsy Cline aboard the Hummingbird. All the stars who pass through Union Station and while the crowd waits to see them he still waits for her.
W: 
W: In 76 he saw the builders close the station down. And it became the finest hotel that had ever grazed this town.
W: 
W: But he still hears the freight train to Chicago but its just the sound a fright trains passing through; he drinks coffee while he waits at union station hotel and while the crowd waits to see them he still waits for her.

W: Of the love in your heart,
W: And it makes even sunshine more bright.

W: Comes your laughter and light.

W: Is the sweetest of all
W: There is ne'er a real care or regret;
W: And while springtime is ours
W: Throughout all of youth's hours,
W: Let us smile each chance we get.

C:Foster and Alan
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: It was on a summer's evening in the merry month of May
W: I was coming from the fair at Cappamore
W: I was driving home thirty pair of heifers by the way
W: And by chance I stood outside a cottage door
W: I just dropped in to light me pipe as any lad might do
W: When going to or coming from a fair
W: When I spied a pretty Coleen with two eyes of melting blue
W: Twas then me heart felt really very quare.
W: 
W: I love to ramble down the old boreen,
W: When the hawthorns blossoms are in bloom
W: And to sit by me gate on that auld mossy seat
W: Whispering to Kate Muldoon
W: 
W: I was coming from me farm down a neighbouring boreen
W: When I met me Kitty tripping like a fawn
W: She gave me such a smile that I felt like in a dream
W: And I never slept a wink that night 'till dawn
W: And the next time that I met her sure I told her of me love
W: She blushed and nearly let her basket fall
W: And she said 'Go on ye skimmer' with a gentle little shove
W: 
W: And that I'd ask me father that was all.
W: I love to ramble down the old boreen,
W: When the hawthorns blossums are in bloom
W: And to sit by me gate on that auld mossy seat
W: Whispering to Kate Muldoon.
W: 
W: I was trashing in me barn when her father came one day
W: Said Patsy Hogan what is this I heard,
W: You've been speaking to me daughter now what have you to say
W: Was then I couldn't say a single word
W: Then he took me by the hand and said Patrick me son
W: I'd be glad to see you settled well in life
W: And since you love me daughter and her heart is fairly won
W: 
W: At shroue time you can make the girl your wife.
W: I love to ramble down the old boreen,
W: When the hawthorns blossums are in bloom
W: And to sit by me gate on that auld mossy seat
W: Whispering to Kate Muldoon

T: The Wee Lass On The Brae
C:Jim MacFarland
B: cassidy
Q: 1/4=100
V:1 
W: As I was a-walkin' one fine summer's day
W: Oh, the fields they were in blossom and the meadows were gay
W: I met a wee lassie trippin' over the green
W: I took her for Helen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: The Grecian queen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: I took her for Helen, the Grec-i-an queen
W: 
W: She's admired by many, I know them right well
W: Each morning to view the sweet spot where she dwells
W: Beneath the downs at the brink of yonder hill
W: May she never marry, but think on me still
W: But think on me still, but think on me still
W: May she never marry, but think on me still
W: 
W: Oh, me parents dote on me, and it's all for their sake
W: And its ofttimes it causes my poor heart to break
W: But the more I think on them, the more I'm inclined to say
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: 
W: So it's fare thee well, me darlin', I love you the best
W: And may you be happy, and may you be blessed
W: And may you think on me when that I am far away
W: For there's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: 
W: In faith there is a decline(?) under yond forest sky
W: And straightway to my true love I surely will fly
W: 
W: And no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
W: The wee lass on the brae, the wee lass on the brae
W: There's no one will be mine but the wee lass on the brae
