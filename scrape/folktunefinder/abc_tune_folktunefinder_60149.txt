W:As I walked out one morning in May
W:The birds did sing and the lambs did play
W:The birds did sing and the lambs did play
W:I met an old man, I met an old man
W:I met an old man by the way
W:
W:His head was bald, his beard was grey
W:His coat was of a myrtle shade
W:I asked him what strange countryman
W:Or what strange place, or what strange place
W:Or what strange place he did belong
W:
W:"My name is Death, cannot you see
W:Lords, dukes, and ladies bow down to me
W:And you are one of those branches three
W:And you fair maid, and you fair maid,
W:And you fair maid must come with me"
W:
W:"I'll give you gold and jewels rare
W:I'll give you costly robes to wear
W:I'll give you all my wealth in store
W:If you'll let me live, if you'll let me live
W:If you'll let me live a few years more"
W:
W:"Fair lady, lay your robes aside
W:No longer glory in your pride
W:And now, sweet maid, make no delay
W:Your time is come, your time is come
W:Your time is come and you must away"
W:
W:And not long after this fair maid died
W:"Write on my tomb," the lady cried,
W:"Here lies a poor distressed maid
W:Whom Death now lately, whom Death now lately
W:Whom Death now lately hath betrayed"
