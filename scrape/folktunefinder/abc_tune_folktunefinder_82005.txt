T:Unto the East Indies We Were Bound
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
L:1/8
W:Unto the East Indies we were bound our gallant ship to steer,
W:And all the time that we sailed on, I thought on my Polly dear:
W:'Tis pressed I was from my truelove the girl whom I adore.
W:And sent unto the raging seas where stormy billows roar.
W:
W:Our captain being a valiant man upon the deck did stand,
W:With a full reward of fifty pounds to the first that should spy land:
W:Then up aloft two boatmen go unto the maintop so high--
W:An hour is past, and then at last--"'Tis land, 'tis land!" they cry.
