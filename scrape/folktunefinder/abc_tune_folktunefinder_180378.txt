T:One Evening Fair
R:song
H:  I learned both the air and the words of this song at home in early
H:youth.  Of the words I can recall the following three verses:
B:
M:C
L:1/8
W:One evening fair as I roved out down by a river side,
W:I heard a lovely maid complain--the tears rolled from her eyes:
W:"It was a cold and stormy night"--those sad words she did say--
W:"When my love went on the raging main, bound for Amerikay.
W:
W:"My love he was a fisherman, his age was scarce eighteen,
W:"He was a handsome young man as ever yet was seen:
W:"My father he has riches great, and O'Reilly was but poor,
W:"And because he was a fisherman he could not him endure.
W:
W:"Says my mother then to me: `My dear, this case is bad indeed,
W:"`Therefore my loving daughter I hope you will take heed;
W:"`If you be fond of Reilly, let him leave this counterie,
W:"`Your father said his life he'd take, so shun his companie.'"
K:F
"Moderately slow."\
