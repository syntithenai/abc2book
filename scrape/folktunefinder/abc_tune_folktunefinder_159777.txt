X:4
T: Young Collins
C: Trad.
Z: From Barrand 
H: Similar but not identical to Sherborne version in Bacon, which Barrand cites as the source.  For one thing, in Bacon the first and fifth full bars of the A part and the fifth full bar of the B part all are the same; here they all are different.  I suspect some of the differences are errors on Barrand's part but maybe not.
