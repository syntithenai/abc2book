N:No tune can adequately commemorate this
N:great fiddler. Ed felt that he
N:was the last of the great players,
N:and the only one he ever heard who
N:had that strange wildness in
N:his playing that only the great
N:ones possess. Ed wrote the tune as
N:if Mike were to play it. Perhaps he
N:alone had the tools to do
N:it complete justice.
