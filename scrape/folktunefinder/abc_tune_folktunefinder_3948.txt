B: Playford 1651
H: Simpson feels that the surviving tune is not the one which had some
H: currency in Elizabethan days. He points out that wrenchings of accent
H: are necessary to accomplish the fit of Playford's dance tune to a
H: curious fragment of text found in the 18th century Percy folio MS, a
H: source of dubious authenticity itself.
H: __ Came you not from Newcastle __
H: __ Came yee not there away &c __
H: It is quite possible that
H: this dance was inspired by William, Duke of Newcastle, a royalist who
H: remained in London and bent his interests towards the theatre during
H: the interregnum.
