W:1.  Let us pause in life's pleasures and count it's many tears
W:While we all sup sorrow with the  poor>
W:There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,
W:"Oh Hard Times come again no more".

W:chorus:  "Tis the song, the sigh of the wea-ry;
W:Hard TImes, Hard TImes, come again no more,
W:Many days you have lingered around my cabin door,
W:Oh! Hard TImes, come  again no more.
W:
W:2. While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay,
W:There are frail forms fainting at the door,
W:Tho' their voices are silent their pleading looks still say,
W: "Oh! Hard Times, come again no more
