N:Dennis lived along the "starry" lane. 
N:His place was near Aunt Ann's home. 
N:As children, Ed and his brother George 
N:would often walk Ann home when night 
N:came on. Ann had keen eyesight and was 
N:able to see Dennis' place long before 
N:the boys could. She said she could 
N:always tell the time of night it was by 
N:"the light in Dennis Munion's window."
