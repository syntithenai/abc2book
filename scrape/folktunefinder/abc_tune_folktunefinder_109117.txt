W:Come all you sons of Uncle Sam, come listen to me awhile
W:And I'll tell you of a capture that was made in Yankee style
W:'Twas the Schooner E.A. Horton in the British harbor lie
W:She was shaken by "The Sweepstakes" while cruising in disguise
W:Our treaties they've rejected and our governments defied
W:It's now you've stolen our fishermen so Johnnies, mind yer eye.
W:
W:'Twas the thirteenth day of October in the year of sixty-one
W:Brave Knowlton and his comrades, the day it was begun
W:While the British thick-skulls were sleepin' with red ruin on their brain
W:We stole away our fishermen and brought her back again
W:
W:Says brave Knowlton to his comrades, "If you will follow me
W:We'll have the Horton home again whate'er the cost may be
W:We'll stick to one another like brothers just as true
W:And we'll show those Yankee thievish-men what Yankee lads can do"
W:
W:'Twas early in the next morning the news did spread about
W:They found the gold prospector with the Horton had stepped out
W:The news began to penetrate the British skulls so thick
W:They finally did acknowledge 'twas a bold and Yankee trick
W:
W:Now boys, there is a jolly time in Glou-cester tonight
W:For heavy guns are firing and torches burning bright
W:The band plays, "Yankee Doodle" and the voices loudly ring
W:For the Yankee boys are shouting that the Horton has got in
W:
W:Now you Dominion Canaday, I warn you to beware
W:You better sigh the treatie and settle this affair
W:And always do to others as you'll have 'em do to you
W:And don't try to treat your neighbor like old Johnnie tried to do
