W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:They sit by the coffin that stands by my bed
W:And they'll be glad when their old man's dead.
W:
W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:They blow out the candles that stand at my head
W:And they'll be glad when their old man's dead.
W:
W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:My children are laughing behind my back,
W:But I won't die for a long, long time.
W:No, I'm gonna live for a long, long time.
W:
W:I'll sit in my window and drink my gin
W:And be as old as my old ma been,
W:I'll sit in my window and I won't cry,
W:And I'll laugh like hell when my children die!
