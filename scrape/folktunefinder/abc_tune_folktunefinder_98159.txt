W:Come all ye young people and listen to me
W:I'm going to tell you my sad destiny,
W:I'm a man by experience whose favours is won
W:Love has been the ruin of many a man.
W:
W:If you go to get married, don't hasten it on
W:And don't you get married till you're full twenty-one
W:And don't you get married till you find your love set,
W:Then marry some good girl your love won't forget.
W:
W:Come all you young gentlenien who want to be smart
W:Don't place your affections on a smiling sweetheart.
W:She's dancing before you some favours to gain,
W:Then turns her back on you witb scorn and disdain.
W:
W:When a man's married he ain't his own man,
W:He must rove through the country and live as he can.
W:He's lost that sweet apparel, tbe flowers of life,
W:For selling his freedom to buy him a wife.
W:
W:But when a man's single he can live at his ease,
W:He can rove through tbe country and do as he please
W:He can rove  through the country and live at his will
W:Kiss Polly, kiss Betsy, and he is the same still.
W:
W:Just pour out another bowl, boys, we'll drink bumpers round
W:We'll drink to the poorest, if they're to be found;
W:We'll drink to the single with the greatest success,
W:Likewise to the married and wish them no less.
