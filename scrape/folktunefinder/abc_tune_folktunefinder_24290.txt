R:Highland
C:Ed Reavy
M:4/4
L:1/8
N:A very quaint modal highland.
N:Ed says it is not his tune,
N:but he has been wrong before.
N:It has the earmarks of a Reavy tune:
N:surprising accidentals, unusual
N:cadences, and a brilliant
N:matching of the two parts.
N:I have never heard anyone
N:but Ed play it.
