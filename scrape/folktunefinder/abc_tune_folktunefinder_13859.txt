N:According to tradition, Bessy Bell and Mary Gray were two young ladies
N:of Perthshire, who, at the time of the plague (in 1645) retired for
N:safety to some cottage or `bower', about a mile from Lynedoch House,
N:Mary Gray's home. A youth, who was much attached to them,
N:supplied them with food from Perth, but at last brought the
N:infection, and they both died; according to custom, they were
N:buried in a lonely spot, instead of with `their noble kin'.
