T:The Races of Ballyhooly
R:song air
H:  From memory, as I learned in my young days.  The Irish song that gave
H:name to this fine air--of which I heard fragments in my youth--commemora
H:d
H:the fate of a number of peasants who were shot down in the neighbourhood
H:f
H:Ballyhooly near Fermoy Co. Cork, while resisting the collection of tithe
H:
H:early in the last century (about 1825).  The poet utters a prophecy, whi
H:
H:has come to pass, that the particular church for which these tithes were
H:assessed would be levelled, till not one stone remained on another.
H:  I have a copy of the whole song written in English letters phoneticall
H:
H:but it is such gibberish that I can make nothing of it.  The first line
H:however is plain enough: T\'a sgeul agum an innsinnt s'n\'a smuainim gur
H:breug \'e: "I have a tale to tell, and I don't think it is a false one."
