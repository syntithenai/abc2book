W:As I was a-walking down Radcliffe highway
W:A recruiting party came a-beating my way
W:They enlisted me and treated me till I did not know
W:And to the Queen's barracks they forced me to go
W:
W:When first I deserted, I thought myself free
W:Until my cruel comrade informed against me
W:I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
W:I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me
W:
W:Court martial, court martial, they help upon me
W:And the sentence passed upon me, three hundred and three
W:May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
W:For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me
W:
W:When next I deserted, I thought myself free
W:Until my cruel sweetheart informed against me
W:I was quickly followed after and brought back with speed
W:I was handcuffed and guarded, heavy irons put on me
W:
W:Court martial, court martial, then quickly was got
W:And the sentence passed upon me, that I was to be shot
W:May the Lord have mercy on them for their sad cruelty
W:For now the Queen's duty lies heavy on me
W:
W:Then up rode Prince Albert in his carriage and sticks
W:Saying "Where is that young man whose coffin is fixed
W:Set him free from his irons and let him go free
W:For he'll make a good soldier for his Queen and country"
