W:  Chorus: 
W:  Oh Colleen, love, oh Colleen love, the rout has now begun,
W:  And I must go a-marching to the beating of a drum.
W:  Come, dress your self all in your best and come along with me
W:  And I'll take you to the wars, me love, in High Germany.
W:
W:Oh Willie, love, oh Willie, come list what I do say:
W:My feet they are so tender, I can not march away
W:And besides, my dearest Willie, I am with child be thee
W:Not fitted for the wars, me love, in High Germany.
W:
W:I'll buy for you a horse, my love, and on it you will ride
W:And all of my delight will be in riding by your side
W:We'll stop at every ale-house, and drink when we are dry
W:We'll be true to one another and get married by and by.
W:
W:Oh cursed be those cruel wars that ever did they rise
W:And out of merry England pass many a man likewise;
W:They took my true-love from me, likewise my brothers three
W:And sent them to the wars m'love in High Germany.
W:
W:My friends I do not value and my foes I do not fear
W:For now my fine love's left me and wanders far and near
W:But when my baby it is born and smiling on my knee
W:I'll think of handsome Willie in High Germany.
