W:As I went out ae May morning
W:A May morning it chanc'd to be
W:There I was aware of a weelfar'd maid
W:Cam linkin' o'er the lea to me.
W:
W:O but she was a weelfar'd maid,
W:The boniest lass that's under the sun;
W:I spier'd gin she could fancy me
W:But her answer was, "I am too young."
W:
W:To be your bride I am too young
W:To be your loun wad shame my kin
W:So therefore pray young man begone
W:For you never, never shall my favour win.
W:
W:But amang yon birks and hawthorns green,
W:Where roses blaw and woodbines hing
W:O there I learn'd my bonie lass,
W:That she was not a single hour too young
W:
W:The lassie blush'd the lassie sighed
W:And the tear stood twinklin' in her e'e
W:"O kind Sir, since ye hae done me this wrang
W:It's pray when will ye marry me
W:
W:It's of that day tak ye no heed
W:For that's a day ye ne'er shall see
W:For ought that pass'd between us twa,
W:Ye had your share as weel as me.
W:
W:She wrang her hands, she tore her hair
W:She cried out most bitterlie
W:Oh what will I say to my mammie
W:When I gae hame wi' my big bellie
W:
W:O as ye maut, so maun ye brew
W:And as ye brew, so maun ye tun
W:But come to my arms my ae bonie lass
W:For ye never shall rue what ye now hae done
