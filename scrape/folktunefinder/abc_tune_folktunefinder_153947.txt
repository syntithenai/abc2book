B:A Breeze Through the CONduit, (c) 1992 by Julia West
H:This was written for a bawdy ballads contest in the SCA back in 1978
W:Don't ever love a fighter:  He'll care more for his sword.
W:And while he's out there fighting you're on the sidelines, bored.
W:And even when you're snuggled close and have him in your arms
W:He's much too bruised and tired to appreciate your charms.
