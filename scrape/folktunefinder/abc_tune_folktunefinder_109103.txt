W:  Chorus:
W:  Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows
W:  Fair is the lily of the valley
W:  Clear are the waters that flow in yonder stream
W:  But my love is fairer than any.

W:Down by the seashore on a cool summer's eve
W:With the moon rising over the heather
W:The moon it shown fair on her head of golden hair
W:And she vowed she'd be my love forever.

W:It is not for the loss of my mother,

W:That I'm leaving my homeland forever.
