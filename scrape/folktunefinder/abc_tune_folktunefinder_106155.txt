% The above setting differs not materially from that in
% Clinton's 200 Irish Melodies for Flute, Dublin 1840.
% Under the same name a much simpler version appears
% in Haverty's 300 Irish Airs, New York 1858, having but
% the exceptional number of 13 bars altogether. To the
% editor this strain was known in boyhood days as "Tow
% Row Row" both names being taken from the first line
% of the song "Tow Row Row, Paddy, will you now",
% which song by the way cannot be found in any Irish
% collection at present available. "Ta na la" or "It is day"
% one of three tunes of that name in Stanford-Petrie
% Collection is obviously the same strain. The arrangement
% however is quite different; the melody and chorus together
% consisting of but 17 bars.
% To add to the diversity, we find that the arrangement of
% "Paddy will you now" to which is set Gavan Duffy's poem
% "Watch and Wait" in Ballads and Songs by the Writers of
% "The Nation" Dublin 1845 is limited to 14 bars.
