H:My fond shepherds of late were so blest::The nymphs were so happy and
H:gay::That each night they went early to rest::And they merrily sung
H:through the day::But Oh what a scene must appear::must the sweet rural
H:pastimes be o'er::must the taber the taber no more strike the ear::must
H:the dance on the green be no more.V2 Must the flocks from their
H:pastures be led::and the herds go wild straying abroad::must the looms
H:be all stopt in each shed::and the ships be all moored in each
H:road::Must the Arts be all scattered around::and must commerce grow
H:sick of her tide()::must religion expire on the ground::and shall
H:virtue sink down by her side.
