N:From this county came some of the greatest 
N:fiddlers in the tradition: Coleman, 
N:Morrison, Scanlon, O'Beirne, and 
N:others before them. It is their Sligo, 
N:the Sligo of Ballymote, Gurteen,
N:and Collooney. And it is also the 
N:Sligo of Ben Bulben, that most famous
N:hill immortalized in the verses of 
N:Ireland's Nobel Prize winning poet 
N:William Butler Yeats.
