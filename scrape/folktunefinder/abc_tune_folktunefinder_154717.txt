w: 1.~John_ | Bar-ley-corn to the sea_ has gone in~a | ship both stout and new, the | thirst to slake of_ Cap-tain Drake and | all_ his loy-al crew.  To_ | ven-ture brave o'er_ wind_ and wave, the | Span-iard for to halt, and | though he die of_ Span-ish grape, he'll live_ as Eng-lish malt. ||
w:2.~John_ Bar-ley-corn's to the court--ing gone all | dressed in fine ar-ray, in | pew-ter clad from_ toe to head to | win_ a la-dy gay.  The | po-e-try that_ he_ dec-laims will | stand him in good stead, for~the | la-dies fair do_ all de-clare they | love_ it more than bread.
w:3.~John_ | Bar-ley-corn's to the hang--man gone and~the | rea-son I'll un-fold: 'Tis~for | rob-bing hon-est_ Eng-lish-men of~their | sil--ver and their gold.  In a | grave un-known by_ cross_ nor stone John | Bar-ley will be lain, 'til~the | rain-y days have_ gone their ways~and he ris--es up a-gain.
