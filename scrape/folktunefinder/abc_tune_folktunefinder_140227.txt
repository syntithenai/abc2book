N:Once in the '90s when the French Farmers were protesting 
N:against EU legislation they blockaded several ports. 
N:Although it was a nuisance I had to admire their spirit- no 
N:complacency there! This tune was written during a long wait 
N:for a ferry and was originally intended for the scordatura 
N:tuning A,DAd. It is on the Spyka album.
