T:Locke Hospital
S:Digital Tradition, laredst3
H:Christy writes: "There have been many British garrisons around the world
H:through the years and each one has had its own Locke Hospital for soldiers
H:who caught the dreaded disease. I believe this is a Dublin song, but if
H:not its musical origins are certainly Irish."
N:One of countless songs of the Unfortunate Rake family. While each telling
N:a completely different story, they all share the description of the funeral
N:(here chorus and verse 3). This version is probably very close to the
N:original version. American versions include "The Streets Of
N:Laredo" and "St. James Infirmary", British versions are "The Unfortunate
N:Rake" and "When I Was On Horseback" and many more. There is a Folkways record
N:("The Unfortunate Rake", FS 3805) dedicated exclusively to this family.
D:Recorded by Christy Moore on "Prosperous" (1972)

W:As I was a-walking down by the Locke Hospital
W:Cold was the morning and dark was the day
W:I spied a young squaddie wrapped up in old linen
W:Wrapped up in old linen as cold as the day

W:  Chorus:
W:  So play the drums slowly and play the fifes lowly
W:  Sound a dead march as you carry him along
W:  And over his coffin throw a bunch of white laurels
W:  For he's a young soldier cut down in his prime.
W:
W:Oh mother, dear mother, come sit ya down by me
W:Sit ya down by me and pity my sad plight
W:For my body is injured and sadly disordered
W:All by a young girl my own heart's delight
W:
W:Get six of me comrades to carry my coffin
W:Get six of me comrades to carry me on high
W:And let every one hold a bunch of white roses
W:So no-one will notice as we pass them by
W:
W:And over his headstone these words they were written
W:"All ye young fellows take warning from me.
W:Beware of the flash girls that roam through the city
W:For the girls of the city were the ruin of me."
