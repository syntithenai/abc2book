N:The tune was well-known in Canada and the US under a variety of titles,
N:including  "City Guards," "First Western Change," "Jinny O Jinny My Toes Are
N:Sore," "Libby Prison Quickstep," "Monongahela March," "O Dear Mother My Toes

N:(1883) is the earliest appearance in print that I find, however, one version
N:was collected by William Sidney Mount and sent to his dancing master brother,
N:c. 1845. Mount has recently been mentioned on Fiddle-L and was a fiddler and
N:painter who lived on Long Island, NY.  Among his famous works are a few with
N:fiddling and dancing in rustic settings. Libby prison was an American Civil
N:War prison. That, coupled with the Mount reference would date it the the
N:mid-1800's at least, in the US.
