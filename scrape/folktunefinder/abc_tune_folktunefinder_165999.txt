T:If Any of Those Children of Hunger Shall Cry
R:song

M:C
L:1/8
W:If any of those children of hunger shall cry,
W:I hope you will relieve them, that are now standing by;
W:I hope you will relieve them from hunger thirst and cold,
W:While we are in America like jolly soldiers bold--
W:                               With a fal-lal-li-da.
W:
W:If any such news should come into this land
W:That we valiant soldiers are sunk in the sand,
W:Which causes many fair maidens' hearts for to weep,
W:Let them hope that our vessel will return o'er the deep--
W:                               With a fal-lal-li-da.
