W:
W: An Irish boy was leaving,
W: Leaving his native home,
W: Crossing the broad Atlantic,
W: Once more he wished to roam,
W: And as he was leaving his mother,
W: Who was standing on the quay,
W: She threw her arms around his waist,
W: And this to him did say,
W:
W: Chorus
W: A mother's love's a blessing,
W: No matter where you roam,
W: Keep her while she's living,
W: You'll miss her when she's gone,
W: Love her as in childhood,
W: Though feeble, old and grey,
W: For you'll never miss a mother's love,
W: Till she's buried beneath the clay,
W:
W: And as the years go onwards,
W: I'll settle down in life,
W: And choose a nice young colleen,
W: And take her for my wife,
W: And as the babes grow older,
W: And climb around my knee,
W: I'll teach them the very same lesson,
W: That my mother taught to me.
