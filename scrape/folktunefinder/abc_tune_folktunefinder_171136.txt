W:There was a lame soldier in time of the war,
W:He had a lame leg and his face were a scar,
W:He marched up the street in Dublin so fair,
W:And in his arms an infant bear.
W:
W:"Pretty Peggy, pretty Peggy, would you agree
W:To leave your old husband and baby to be,
W:To leave your old husband and baby to be,
W:And go with a soldier and sail on the sea'
W:
W:Pretty Peggy, pretty Peggy, she did agree
W:To leave her old husband and baby to be,
W:To leave her old husband and baby to be,
W:And go with the soldier and sail on the sea.
W:
W:John bridled his horses and away he did ride,
W:Expecting to see Peg down by the seaside,
W:But when he got there it was late in the day-
W:And Peg and her soldier had sailed far away.
W:
W:They had not been sailing more than two weeks or three,
W:Till Peg and her soldier they two disagreed;
W:He kicked her and he cuffed her and he called her whore,
W:He bid her adieu to her own country.
W:
W:Now, when Peg got back it was late in the night,
W:Because she was ashamed to be seen in daylight,
W:She crept to the window to listen awhile,
W:To hear her old husband sing to her dear child.
W:
W:"Rock-a-bye, baby, and don't you cry,
W:Your mamma's gone and left you and I cannot tell why;
W:But if she comes back here, she can't stay with me,
W:She may go with her soldier and sail on the sea."
W:
W:"Open my door and let me in,
W:And I will never be called a false wench again."
W:"Go way from my door and leave me alone,
W:Go sail with your soldier, he'll find you a home!"
