W:The lambs on the green hills, they sport and they play
W:And many strawberries grow round the salt sea
W:How sad is my heart when my love is away
W:How many's the ships sails the ocean
W:
W:The bride and the bride's party to church they did go
W:The bride she rode foremost, she bears the best show
W:But I followed after with my heart filled with woe
W:To see my love wed to another
W:
W:The first place I saw her was in the church stand
W:Gold rings on her fingers and her love by the hand
W:Says I, ma wee lassie, I will be the man
W:Altho you are wed to another
W:
W:The next place I saw her was on the way home
W:I ran on before her, not knowing where to roam
W:Says I, ma wee lassie, I'll be by your side
W:Altho you are wed to another
W:
W:Stop, stop, says the groomsman, til I speak a word
W:Will you venture your life on the point of my sword
W:For courting so slowly you've lost this fair maid
W:So, begone for you'll never enjoy her
W:
W:O make now my grave, both large, wide and deep
W:And sprinkle it over with flowers so sweet
W:And lay me down in ti to take my last sleep
W:For that's the best way to forget her
