W:1
W:Way down on de old plantation, Dah's where I was born.
W:I used to beat da whole creation, Hoe'in in da corn. Oh!
W:Den I work and den I sing, So happy all da day. Til
W:Angelina Baker came, And stole my heart away.
W:Chorus
W:Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker's gone. She
W:Angelina Baker! Angelina Baker's gone. She
W:She left me here to weep a tear, And beat on da ol' jawbone.
W:Left me here to weep a tear, And beat on da ol' jawbone.
W:2
W:I've seen my Angelina, In de springtime and de fall,
W:I've seen her in de corn-field, And I've seen her at de ball;
W:And ebry time I met her, She was smilin like de sun,
W:But now I'm left to weep a tear, Cause Angelina's gone.
W:Chorus
W:3
W:Angelina am so tall, She nebber sees de ground.
W:She hab to take a wellumscope, To look down on de town.
W:Angelina like de boys, As far as she can see dem,
W:She used to run ol massa round, To ax him for to free dem.
W:Chorus
W:4
W:Early in de morning, Ob a lubly summer day,
W:I ax for Angelina, And dey say, "she's gone away."
W:I don't know wha to find her, Cayce I don't know wha she's gone.
W:She left me here to weep a tear, And beat on the ol' jawbone.
W:Chorus
