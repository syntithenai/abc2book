N:I think what is meant with the repeats is that the 1st bar is played
N:first time through, but after that the  last bar replaced the first bar
N: $ = conventional
N:dal segno sign...  is , yes, a cross. The first bar line, shown here
N:as double with repeat marks, is single in the MS, but ABC2win wants it
