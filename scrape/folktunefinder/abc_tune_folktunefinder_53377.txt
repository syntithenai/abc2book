N:Ed was told there lived near the edge of the
N:glen a fiddler unlike any he had ever heard. 
N:To this day he wonders 
N:about that solitary fiddler and the strange 
N:tunes he played beside a 
N:distant glen in Cavan. Although he never saw 
N:him play, Ed has heard 
N:some of those same strange tunes in his 
N:dreams. And they have become 
N:his finest compositions.
