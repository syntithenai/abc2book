R:waltz
N:I finished this waltz in July 2001 during the contra musicians' week at the
N:John C. Campbell Folk School. One of my fellow student musicians named it.
N:I had imagined the tune to be fast and strongly accented, but once we started
N:playing it, we found a slow tempo (dotted half = 50) worked better. -RL
