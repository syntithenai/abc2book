Q:400
N:I'm not sure who wrote this  tune but I think it was a 
N:combined effort. There is a recording of it on the Waulk 
N:Elektrik album House Music. The first tune in that set is a 
N:Swedish polska entitled Brannvin, which is some kind of 
N:Swedish alcoholic beverage I believe. However, this tune was 
N:named after the comet Hale Bobb which graced our summer 
N:nights that year - can't remember what year it was, mind you.
K:Ador
