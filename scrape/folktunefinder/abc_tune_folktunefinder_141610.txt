% Among the mass of his father's manuscript music which Sergt. James
% O'Neill brought from Belfast in his youth, was a copy of "The Knight
% of St. Patrick Lancers". Many of the original tunes of which it was
% composed having been subjected to alteration in the process of its
% arrangement, its publication in that form in the O'Neill Collections
% was then not favorably considered.  Since the appearance of Dr.
% Joyce's  "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs" in 1909, the composition
% has assumed  new interest. In a note to a  "Reel", page 63, the
% learned author remarks:
%  "I find a setting different from mine in a single obscure publication
%     The Knight of St. Patrick  Lancers, long since out of print".
% Dr. Joyce's unnamed "Reel" it may be added is the well known
% "Bonnie Kate". Taking all things into consideration The Knight of
% St. Patrick Lancers cannot be out of place in a collection of Waifs
% and Strays of Gaelic Melody.
%NOTE: Due to the length of this tune, I have separated it into
%            5 parts. (PTK)
