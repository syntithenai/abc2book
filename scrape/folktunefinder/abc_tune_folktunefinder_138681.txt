% There is enough resemblance between the above melody and that
% which follows to suggest a common origin. The "Dalkeith Maiden"
% was taken from Aird's  Selections of Scotch, English, Irish and
% Foreign Airs, Vol.III, published in  Glasgow, 1786. The earliest
%setting of "Biddy I'm Not Jesting" available is that obtained by
% Petrie in 1829  from Paddy Coneely, the famousGalway piper,
%and which appears in  the key of A Flat in the Stanford Petrie
% Collection of Irish Music. The source of this memorized version
%of earlier years cannot now be recalled by the writer.
