N:There is a symbol before the time signature.  It could be a sharp on
N:the second line down, but its got long trailing legs if it is.  It
N:could be an attempt at a clef other than treble.  The tune makes sense
N:if you play it as bass clef, but ABC doesn't seem to have a bass clef.
N:Why won't ABC show the slur from  begining of second bar after double
N:vbar to 3rd note of 3rd bar
