% The earliest setting of this rare composition which the compiler can
% trace is that found in Vol.3 of Aird's Selections of Scotch, English,
% Irish and Foreign Airs, printed in 1788. Slightlly disguised as
% "Captain Oakhain: A Favorite Irish Tune", it appears in McGoun's
% Repository of Scots and Irish Airs, Strathspeys, Reels, etc. Glasgow
% 1803", but it is not numbered among the Bunting or Petrie
% Collections. "The Wounded Hussar" we learn from Alexander
% Campbell's song of that name printed with the music in Smith's Irish
% Minstrel, Edinburgh 1825" was Captain Henry O'Kain who died of
% his wounds on "the banks fo the dark rolling Danube".
% Included as one of Carolan's compositions in Hardiman's Irish
% Minstrelsy, 1831" the author adds: "Capt. O'Kane or O'Cahan of a
% distinguished family, a sporting Irishman well know in Antrim in his
% day as "Slasher O'Kane'". There can be no doubt that he was
% the hero of Campbell's song. The Wounded Hussar is also included in
% Serenne's "Songs of Ireland without words, Edinburgh 1854".
