N:I'm told that the road from Carrickmacross to Crossmaglen
N:is lined with your worst sort of rogues. The verse
N:perhaps comes from some old cantankerous Irishman
N:who probably never himself walked this road. If he had,
N:he would surely have been charmed with the likes of what he
N:saw and heard. (Another tune to delight Ed's close friend
N:from Armagh: Lou Quinn).
