W: Once I was happy, but now I'm forlorn,
W: Like an old coat that is tattered and torn;
W: Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn,
W: Betrayed by a maid in her teens.
W: 
W: Now this girl that I loved, she was handsome,
W: And I tried all I knew her to please,
W: But I never could please her one quarter so well
W: As the man on the flying trapeze.
W: 
W: Oh, he floats through the air with the greatest of ease,
W: This daring young man on the flying trapeze;
W: His actions are graceful, all girls he does please,
W: My love he has purloined away.
