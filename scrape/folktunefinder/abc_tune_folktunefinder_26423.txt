W:The night her blackest sable wore
W:And gloomy were the skies,
W:And glitt'ring stars there were no more
W:Than those in Stella's eyes.
W:When at her fther's gate I knocked
W:Where I had often been,
W:And shrowded only in her smock
W:The fair one let me in.
W:
W:Fast lock'd within her close embrace
W:She trembling lay asham'd
W:Her swelling breast and glowing face
W:And every touch inflamed.
W:My eager passion I obey'd
W:Resolv'd the fort to win;
W:And her fond heart was soon betray'd
W:To yield and let me in.
W:
W:Then then beyond expressing
W:Immortal was the joy
W:I knew no greater blessing
W:So great a god was I
W:And she, transported with delight
W:Oft pray'd me come again
W:And kindly vowed that every night
W:She'd rise and let me in.
W:
W:But oh at last she prov'd with bern (sic)
W:And sighing sat and dull,
W:And I that was as much concerned
W:Look'd then just like a fool.
W:Her lovely eyes with tears run o'er
W:Repenting her rash sin;
W:She sigh'd and curs'd the fatal hour
W:That e'er she let me in.
W:
W:But who could cruelly deceive
W:Or from such beauty part
W:I lov'd her so, I could not leave
W:The charmer of my heart.
W:But wedded and conceal'd the crime
W:Thus all was well again;
W:And now she thanks the blessed hour
W:That e'er she let me in.
