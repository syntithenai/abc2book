N: Anthony writes:
N: I have made enquiries among the older North London musicians and there  seems
N: to  be  a  consensus  opinion  that the tune was first recorded by Joe Burke,
N: after a trip to Camden in about 1960; and that the composer was Bobby  Casey.
N: There  are  no  written  documents,  just  the  memories of old men, which is
N: probably the best you will get.
K: A Minor
