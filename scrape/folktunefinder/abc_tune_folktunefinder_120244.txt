N:Glens are not always pictures of springtime
N:greenery. Ed remembers them much as
N:Nora did in Syngeis Shadow of the Glen-
N:"and seeing nothing but the mists rolling
N:down the bog, and the mists again,
N:and they rolling up the bog, and hearing nothing
N:but the wind crying out in the bits of
N:broken trees left from the great storm, and
N:the streams roaring with the rain."
N:Ireland is the terrible beauty of the dark glen
N:in the depth of its wild wind and storm.
K:Bb
