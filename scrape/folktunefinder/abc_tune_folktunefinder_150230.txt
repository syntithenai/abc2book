N:Ed got the "strains" of this tune many years ago from Jimmy McElroy,
N:a County Monaghan flute player. The title comes from Synge's verse
N:about Patch Shaneen and Maurya Prendergast. Shaneen grieves
N:the passing of Maurya, his wife, who travelled the roads with
N:him "west in Carnareagh"-
N:"She'd pick her bag of carrageen
N:Or perries through the surf,
N:Or loan an ass of Foxy Jim
N:To fetch her creel of turf."
N:The poor couple had little, but they loved
N:much. The poem and tune make a good match for anyone seeking
N:a glimpse of the old Ireland.
