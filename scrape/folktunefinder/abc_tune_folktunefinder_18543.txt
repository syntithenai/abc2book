W:In the merry month of May from my home I started
W:Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken-hearted
W:Saluted Father dear, kissed my darlin' Mother
W:Drank a pint of beer my grief and tears to smother
W:Then off to reap the corn, and leave where I was born
W:I cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghost and goblin,
W:In a bran'new pair of brogues I rattled o'er the bogs
W:And frightened all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin,
W:
W:cho: One, two, three, four five, hunt the hare and turn her
W:     Down the rocky roaad, and all the ways to Dublin
W:     Whack fol-lol-de-ra.
W:
W:In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
W:Started by daylight next morning light and airy,
W:Took a drop of the pure, to keep my heart from sinking,
W:That's an frishman's cure, whene'er he's on for drinking,
W:To see the lasses smile, laughing all the while,
