T:Chalk Sunday
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:jig/song air
H:From Davy Condon, thatcher, of Ballyorgan, 1844.  Chalk Sunday was the
H:Sunday after Shrove Tuesday, when those young men who should have been
H:married, but were not, were marked with a heavy streak of chalk on the back
H:of the Sunday coat, by boys who carried bits of chalk in their pockets for
H:that purpose, and lay in wait for the bachelors.  The marking was done while
H:the congregation were assembling for Mass: and the young fellow ran for his
H:life, always laughing, and often singing the concluding words of some
H:suitable doggerel such as: "And you are not married though Lent has come!"
H:This custom prevailed in some parts of Limerick, where I saw it in full
H:play: but I think it has died out.
