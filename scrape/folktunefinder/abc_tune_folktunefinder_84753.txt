X:85
T:Chestnut
T:Doves Figary
H:The tune is reminiscent today of the first phrase of "God rest ye
H:merry, gentlemen", and is a folk tune of widest distribution, the "tune
H:of luck-visit songs, wassails, harvest suppers, may carols and their
H:parodies, 'chestnut' having feminine symbolism. The second title may
H:be expalined by Deloney's ballad of 1600 on Dove's roguery with the
H:women. Although it is an awkward fit, repeating the last words of some
H:lines might make it work.
