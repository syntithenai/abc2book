W:1. Hey! Johnny Cope, are ye walkin' yet   Or are your drums a-beatin' yet
W:Gie you were walkin' I would wait,   Tae gang tae the coals in the mornin'
W:
W:2. Cope sent a letter frae Dunbar,   Charlie meet me an' ye dare
W:I'll learn ye the airts o' war,   If ye'll met me in the mornin'
W:
W:3. When Charlie looked the letter upon,   He drew his sword his scabbard from
W:Follow me my merry men,   Meet Johnny Cope in the mornin'
W:
W:4. When Johnny Cope heard o' this,   He thought it wouldnae be amiss
W:Tae hae a horse in readiness,   Tae flee awa' in the mornin'
W:
W:5. Fie noo Johnny, get up and rin,  The Highland bagpipes mak' a din
W:Better tae sleep wi' a hale skin,   It'll be a bloody mornin'
W:
W:6. When Johnny Cope tae Dunbar cam'   They speirded him, Whaur's a' your men
W:The de'il confound me gin I ken   I left them a' in the mornin'
W:
W:7. Fie noo Johnny, ye werenae blate   Tae come wi' the news o' your ain defeat
W:And leave your men in sic a strait   Early in the mornin'
W:
W:8. Faith, quo' Johnny, I got sic flegs   Frae their claymores and philabegs
W:Gin I face them again de'il brak' my legs   I'll bid ye's a' good mornin'
