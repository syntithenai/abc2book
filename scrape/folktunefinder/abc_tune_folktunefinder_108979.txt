W:Come all you coal miners wherever you may be
W:And listen to a story that I'll relate to thee
W:My name is nothing extra, but the truth to you I'll tell
W:I am a coal miner's wife, I'm sure I wish you well
W:
W:I was born in old Kentucky, in a coal camp born and bred
W:I know all about the pinto beans, bulldog gravy and cornbread
W:And I know how the coal miners work and slave in the coal mines everyday
W:For a dollar in the company store, for that is all they pay
W:
W:Coal mining is the most dangerous work in our land today
W:With plenty of dirty slaving work and very little pay
W:Coal miner won't you wake up and open your eyes and see
W:What the dirty capitalist system is doing to you and me
W:
W:They take your very life blood and they take our children's lives
W:They take fathers away from children and husbands away from wives
W:Oh miner, won't you organize wherever you may be
W:And make this a land of freedom for workers like you and me
W:
W:Dear miner, they will slave you until you can't work no more
W:And what'll you get for your living but a dollar in a company store
W:A tumble-down shack to live in, snow and rain pours in the top
W:You have to pay the company rent, your paying never stops
W:
W:I am a coal miner's wife, I'm sure I wish you well
W:Let's sink this capitalist system in the darkest pits of hell
