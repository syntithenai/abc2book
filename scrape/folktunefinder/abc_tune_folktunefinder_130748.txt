W:1. Believe me, if all those endearing young charms, 
W:Which I gaze on so fondly today, 
W:Were to change by tomorrow, and fleet in my arms, 
W:Like fairy gifts, fading away,
W:Thou wouldst still be adored as this moment thou art, 
W:Let thy loveliness fade as it will;
W:And around the dear ruin, each wish of my heart 
W:Would entwine itself verdantly still!
W:
W:2. It is not while beauty and youth are thine own, 
W:and thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear,
W:That the fervor and faith of a soul can be known, 
W:To which time will but make thee more dear!
W:No, the heart that has truly loved never forgets, 
W:But as truly loves on to the close;
W:As the sunflower turns on her god, when he sets, 
W:The same look which she turned when he rose!
