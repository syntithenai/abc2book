W:I am a little beggarman and begging i have been
W:For three score or more on this little isle of green
W:I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
W:And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu.
W:Of all the trades that's goin' now sure begging is the best
W:Ah, for when a man is tired he can sit down and rest
W:Beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
W:Only cut around the corner with his old rigadoo.

W:I slept in a barn down at Currabawn
W:A wet night came on and I slept until the dawn
W:With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
W:And the cats and the rats, they were playing peekaboo.
W:When who should appear but the woman of the house
W:With her white, spotty apron and her calico blouse.
W:She began to frighten and I said, Boo
W:Arrah, don't be afraid, ma'am, it's only Johnny Dhu!
