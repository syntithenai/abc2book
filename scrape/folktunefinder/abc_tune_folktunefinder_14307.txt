H:This short-lived dance may be associated with Shirley's popular play
H:"Hide Park" (1637), which contained a wedding scene with dancing.  In
H:1668, Pepys attended a revival which included live horses brought on
H:stage, probably for the race scene in the fourth act.  He was not much
H:impressed and considered it "a very moderate play".
