N:Ed got the "strains" of this tune 
N:many years ago from Jimmy McElroy, 
N:a County Monaghan flute player. The title 
N:comes from Synge's verse 
N:about Patch Shaneen and Maurya 
N:Prendergast. Shaneen grieves 
N:the passing of Maurya, his wife, 
N:who travelled the roads with 
N:him "west in Carnareagh"- 
N:"She'd pick her bag of carrageen 
N:Or perries through the surf, 
N:Or loan an ass of Foxy Jim
N:To fetch her creel of turf." 
N:The poor couple had little, but they loved 
N:much. The poem and tune make a 
N:good match for anyone seeking 
N:a glimpse of the old Ireland.
