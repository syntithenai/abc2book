W:Beer, beer, beer, tiddly, beer, beer, beer.
W:
W:A long time ago, way back in history,
W:When all there was to drink was nothin' but cups of tea.
W:Along came a man by the name of Charlie Mops,
W:And he invented a wonderful drink, and he made it out of hops. Hey!
W:
W:Chorus:
W:He must have been an admiral, a sultan or a king,
W:And to his praises we shall always sing.
W:Look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer!
W:Lord bless Charlie Mops, the man who invented beer, beer, beer.
W:Tiddly, beer, beer, beer.
W:
W:The Curtis bar, the James' Pub, the Hole in the Wall as well.
W:One thing you can be sure of, it's Charlie's beer they sell.
W:So all ye lads an' lasses at eleven o'clock ye stop.
W:For five short seconds, remember Charlie Mops. 1 2 3 4 5 Hey!
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:A barrel of malt, a bushel of hops, you stir it around with a stick.
W:The kind of lubrication to make your engine tick.
W:Forty pints of wallop a day will keep away the quacks.
W:Its only eight pence hapenny and one and six in tax. 1 2 3 4 5 Hey!
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:The Lord bless Charlie Mops!
