W:South wind of the gentle rain, you banish winter weather
W:Bring salmon to the pool again, the bees among the heather
W:If northward now you mean to blow, as you rustle soft above me
W:God speed be with you as you go and a kiss for those that love me
W:
W:From south I come with velvet breeze, my word all nature blesses,
W:I melt the snow and strew the leaves with flowers and warm caresses;
W:I'll help you to dispel your woes, with joy I'll take your greeting
W:And bear it to your loved Mayo upon my wings so fleeting.
W:
W:Ny Connaught, famed for wine and play, so leal, so gay, so loving
W:Here's my fond kiss I send today borne on the wind in its roving.
W:Those Munster folk are good and kind, right royally they treat me
W:But this land I'd gladly leave behind, with your Connaught pipes to greet me.
