W:1. It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old,
W:From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
W:Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
W:The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing.
W:
W:2. Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurled
W:And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world.
W:Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
W:And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing.
W:
W:3. O, ye beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
W:Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
W:Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
W:O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing.
W:
W:4. For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
W:When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
W:When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
W:And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing.
