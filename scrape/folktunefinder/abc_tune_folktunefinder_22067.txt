H:The tune is reminiscent today of the first phrase of "God rest ye
H:merry, gentlemen", and is a folk tune of widest distribution, the "tune
H:of luck-visit songs, wassails, harvest suppers, may carols and their
H:parodies, 'chestnut' having feminine symbolism.  The second title may
H:be expalined by Deloney's ballad of 1600 on Dove's roguery with the
H:women.  Although it is an awkward fit, repeating the last words of some
H:lines might make it work.
W:Welcome to town, Tom Dove, Tom Dove,
W:The merriest man alive
W:Thy
W:company stil we love, we love,
W:God grant thee well to thrive
W:All
W:never will depart from thee
W:For better or worse, my joy
W:For thou
W:shalt still have our good will
W:God's blessing on my sweet boy
