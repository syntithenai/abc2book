N: Couple Mixer; description from Janet Gabites <jgabites@eos.ubc.CA>
N: Start the dance with two couples facing each other but offset so that the
N: men are side by side, near arms linked. The other arm is around their
N: partner's waist. The women are on the outside holding near shoulder with
N: left hand, and partner's hand at the waist on the right. Running step
N: around in a mill - if weight and size ratios are right and the music is
N: fast enough, the women can fly. For the next section, open the line to
N: hand-holds and pass the women in and under the mens' arms. Men keep
N: holding hands, and women keep holding their partner's right hand. Women
N: now turn back in to link free hands and the whole double-handed mill
N: rotates. The third section is a waltz, first tyrolia (out, in, out, in)
N: then regular partner waltz around the other couple. The whole dance then
N: repeats. If it is being used as a mixer, each couple uses the waltzing to
N: move off to find a new couple to dance with.
