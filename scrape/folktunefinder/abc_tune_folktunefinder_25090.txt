W:A handsome young sailor to London came down
W:He'd been paid off his ship in old Liverpool town
W:They asked him his name and he answered them, "Quite
W:I belong to a family called nine times a night"
W:
W:Well a handsome young widow who still wore her weeds
W:Her husband had left her his money and deeds
W:Resolved she was on her conjugal rights
W:And to soften her sorrows with nine times a night
W:
W:So she's called to her serving maids Ann and Amelia
W:To keep a watch out for this wonderful sailor
W:And if ever he happened to chance in their sight
W:To bring her fond tidings of nine times a night
W:
W:She was favored by fortune the very next day
W:These two giggling saw him coming their way
W:They've rushed up the stairs full of amorous delight
W:Crying, "There comes that sailor with his nine times a night"
W:
W:She's jumped out of bed and she's pulled on her clothes
W:And straight to the hall door like lightening she goes
W:She's looked him once over and gave him a smack
W:And the bargain was struck: no more sailing for Jack
W:
W:The wedding was over, the bride tolled the bell
W:Jack trimmed her sails five times and that pleased her well
W:She vowed to herself she was satisfied quite
W:But she still gives sly hints about nine times a night
W:
W:Says Jack, "My dear bride, you mistook me quite wrong
W:I said to that family I did belong
W:Nine times a night's a bit hard for a man
W:I couldn't do it myself, but me sister she can"
