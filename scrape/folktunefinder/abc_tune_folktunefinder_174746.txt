%Posted Jan 18th 2000 at ABC-users by Christophe Declercq who had this to say:
%'Belgium is not in the Balkans but, just  for the fun of it...  here
%a "Matelotte" (as written in the notebook) or "Maclote" (as said now)
%from the notebook of Jean Guillaume Houssa, a fiddler living in the
%South-East of Belgium around 1850. The "maclote" is a dance (in 6/8
%or in 2/4) from the Ardennes region, in the French speaking part of
%Belgium (Wallonie).
%BTW, in JG Houssa's notebook, there is also a version of the
%Matelotte posted recently by Laura Conrad.
