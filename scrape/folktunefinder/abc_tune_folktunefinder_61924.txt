W:The Lord of Scotland, he is come home
W:Unto his fair lady;
W:He brought her the keys to the seven locks,
W:And some she knew very well.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  She took him onto the two-edged sword:
W:  His heart's blood came trinkeling down.
W:
W:"Why have you wownded me, my fair lady,
W:Why did you wownd me so sore
W:There wasn't a lord in all of Scotland
W:That loved his lady more!"
W:
W:"Now I'll ride east, now I'll ride west,
W:Now I'll set under the sun;
W:I will bring some bonnie leaves
W:Will cure you from your wownd."
W:
W:"You needn't ride east, you needn't ride west
W:You needn't set under the sun;
W:There's na thing can cure my wownd,
W:Except it is God alone."
W:
W:She went unto her pretty fair maids
W:Three hours before it was day,
W:Says, "I've a dead lord within my bower,
W:I wish you to carry him away."
W:
W:"If you've a dead lord within your bower,
W:There he'll have for to stay,
W:For neither one of us will touch him
W:Until the break of day."
W:
W:"Gold will be your hire, pretty maids,
W:Silver shall he your fee,
W:And I will bear you company
W:To carry him away."
W:
W:One took him by the old grey locks,
W:Another by the hands and feet;
W:They plunged him in a new-dug well
W:Fifty-four fathoms deep.
W:
W:"You lie there, my own wedded lord,
W:Sink and do not swim,
W:Then neither me nor my family
W:Will be injured by your rising."
W:
W:As she was a-going on
W:She met her father-in-law:
W:He says, "Where is my son, and where has he gone,
W:And when will he return"
W:
W:I do not know where he is gone
W:He's been gone a day or two."
W:
W:"He has been gone a day or two,
W:I think it'll be three tomorrow,
W:And if he does not then return
W:My heart will be broke with sorrow. "
W:
W:As she was a-going home,
W:She seen a little bird on a briar:
W:He sings, "Go home, you false lady
W:And pay the maids you hired."
W:
W:"You come here my sweet little bird
W:Set down on my knee,
W:I have a cage of pure yellow gold
W:So freely I'll give it to thee."
W:
W:"You can keep your cage of gold
W:I'll keep my green tree,
W:For you have murdered your own wedded lord
W:I know that you'd kill me."
W:
W:If I had a shooting bow
W:And that well-fixed with a string,
W:I'd let an arrow fly at you
W:Among them leaves so green."
W:
W:"Well, if you had a shooting bow
W:And that well-fixed with a string,
W:I'd take a-flight, I'd fly away
W:You'd never seen me again."
