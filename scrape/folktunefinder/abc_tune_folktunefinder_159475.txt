B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  The Munster people--as I have stated elsewhere in this book--sang
H:several of Burns' songs to native Irish airs.  The song "From thee Eliza I
H:must go" I have often heard sung when a boy, always with the following Irish
H:air.  Compare with "Una" in my "Ancient Irish Music."
