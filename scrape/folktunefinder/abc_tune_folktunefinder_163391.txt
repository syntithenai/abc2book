I'll leave it to you to choose when to cut and when to tap to separate the doubled notes (mostly E's A's and G's). The ~E3 roll in the last line of the B part sounds less like a roll and more like three E eighth notes with a more deliberate cut and tap breaking them up. Kevin also plays |GDEG D3 E| for that measure.
