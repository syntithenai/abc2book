% This tune is a variant of "The Cloone Hornpipe" pubished in O'Neill's
% Music of Ireland 1903, and O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland 1907.
% It was obtained from Sergt. James Early who learned it from his
% tutor on the Union Pipes "Old Man" Quinn. Like many other fine=20
% tunes it was anonymous, so it was named "The Cloone Hornpipe"
% in honor of the famous piper's native town and parish in County
% Leitrim, Ireland.
%   Its continued popularity is evidenced by its inclusion in a recent
% Irish Collection under the identical name invented for it by its
% sponsor, Sergt. James Early of Chicago.
