Q:400
N:A very good (but also extremely annoying at times) friend 
N:moved away and this tune was written to remember him by - 
N:partly from sadness, but mostly from relief that he'd left! It is 
N:an unusual 4-part jig because the 2nd part was written as a 
N:slip jig. However, I haven't worked out how to change time 
N:signatures in abc so I've just kept it in 6/8 all the way 
N:through. So if you play it, it should have that slippy feel in 
N:the middle. This was originally written for the scordatura 
N:tuning A,DAd. 
K:Edor
