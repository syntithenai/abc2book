W:On a wagon bound for market
W:There's a calf with a mournful eye.
W:High above him there's a swallow
W:Winging swiftly through the sky.
W:
W:How the winds are laughing
W:They laugh with all their might
W:Laugh and laugh the whole day through
W:And half the summer's night.

W:Dona dona dona dona
W:Dona dona dona down

W:Dona dona dona down
W:
W:"Stop complaining," said the farmer,
W:"Who told you a calf to be"
W:Why don't you have wings to fly away
W:Like the swallow so proud and free"
W:
W:Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
W:Never knowing the reason why.
W:But whoever treasures freedom,
W:Like the swallow must learn to fly
