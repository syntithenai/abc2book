W:There was twa wives, and twa witty wives,
W:As e'er play'd houghmagandie,
W:And they coost oot, upon a time,
W:Out o'er a drink o brandy;
W:Up Maggie rose, and forth she goes,
W:An she leaves auld Mary flytin,
W:And she farted by the byre-en'
W:For she was gaun a shiten.
W:
W:She farted by the byre-en',
W:She farted by the stable;
W:And thick and nimble were her steps
W:As fast as she was able:
W:Till at yon dyke-back the hurly brak,
W:But raxin for some dockins,
W:The beans and pease cam down her thighs,
W:And she cackit a' her stockins.
