B:A Breeze Through the CONduit, (c) 1992 by Julia West
W:Early in the morning, I saw the fighters pass
W:Shining in their armor, leaping o'er the grass
W:The hunting horns were sounding, I watched them pounding by
W:Early in the morning, to hunt the butterfly
W:Early in the morning, to hunt the butterfly.
