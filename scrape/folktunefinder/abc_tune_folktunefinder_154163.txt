W:It was down by the Sally Gardens, my love and I did meet.
W:She crossed the Sally Gardens with little snow-white feet.
W:She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree,
W:But I was young and foolish, and with her did not agree.

W:In a field down by the river, my love and I did stand
W:And on my leaning shoulder, she laid her snow-white hand.
W:She bid me take life easy , as the grass grows on the weirs
W:But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.
