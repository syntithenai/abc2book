W:There was a king, a glorious king, a king of noble fame
W:And he had daughters only one, Lady Diamond was her name
W:
W:He had a boy, a kitchen boy, a boy of muckle scorn
W:She loved him long, she loved him aye, til the grass o'ergrew the  corn
W:
W:When twenty weeks were gone and past, oh, she began to greet
W:For her petticoat grew short before and her stays they would not  meet
W:
W:It fell upon a winter's night, the king could get no rest
W:He came unto his daughter dear, just like a wandering ghost
W:
W:He came unto his daughter dear, pulled back the curtains long
W:What aileth thee, my daughter dear, I fear you have gotten wrong
W:
W:Oh, if I have, despise me not, for he is all my joy
W:I will forsake both dukes and earls and marry your kitchen boy
W:
W:Oh, bring to me my merry men all by thirty and by three
W:Oh bring to me my kitchen boy, we'll murder him secretly
W:
W:There was not a sound into the hall and ne'er a word was said
W:until they had him safe and sure between two featherbeds
W:
W:Cut the heart from out of his breast, put it in a cup of gold
W:And present it to his Diamond dear, for she was both stout and  bold
W:
W:They Cut the heart from out of his breast, put it in a cup of gold
W:And presented it to his Diamond dear, for she was both stout and  bold
W:
W:Oh, come to me, my hinny, my heart, oh, come to me my joy
W:Oh, come to me, my hinny, my heart, my father's kitchen boy
W:
W:She took the cup from out of their hands and set it at her bed  head
W:She washed it with tears that fell from her eyes and next morning  she was dead
W:
W:Oh, where were you, my merry men all, when I gave meat and wage
W:That you didn't stay my cruel hand when I was in a rage
W:
W:For gone is all my heart's delight, oh, gone is all my joy
W:For my dear Diamond, she is dead, likewise my kitchen boy
