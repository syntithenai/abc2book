% This air like scores of others was unconsciously memorized in my
% boyhood days at Tralibane some three miles southeast of Bantry,
% West Cork. All that I can remember now of the ballad sung to it is the
% distich:
%     "My true love he has gone from me, and I can't tell how far
%       Eighteen hundred thousand miles , on board of a man of war"
% It is not likely that the poetaster in equalizing his meter realized
% the absurdity of a voyage equal to seventy-two times the
% circumference of the earth.
