W: Chorus:  (same melody as verse)
W:         We are living 'neath the great Big Dipper
W:         We are washed by the very same rain
W:         We are swimming in the stream together
W:         Some in power, some in pain
W:         We can worship this ground we walk on
W:         Cherishing the beings that we live beside
W:         Loving spirits will live forever
W:         We're all swimming to the other side.
W:
W: I am alone, and I am searching, hungering for answers in my time
W: I am balanced at the brink of wisdom, I'm impatient to receive a sign
W: I move forward with my senses open, in perfection will be my pride
W: In humility I will listen, we're all swimming to the other side
W:
W: On this journey of thoughts and feelings, finding intuition: my head, my heart
W: I am gathering the tools together, I'm preparing to do my part
W: All of those who have come before me, band together to be my guides
W: Loving lessons that I will follow, we're all swimming to the other side
W:
W: When we get there we'll discover, all of the gifts we've been given to share
W: Have been with us since life's beginning and we never noticed they were there
W: We can balance at the brink of wisdom, never recognize that we've arrived
W: Loving spirits will live together, we're all swimming to the other side
