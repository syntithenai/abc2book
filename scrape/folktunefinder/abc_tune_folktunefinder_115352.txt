W:You may sing or speak about Easter week or the heroes of Ninety-eight
W:Those Fenian men who roamed the glen for vict'ry or defeat
W:Their names on history's page are told, their memories will endure
W:Not  a song was sung about three young men in the Valley of Knockanure.
W:
W:There was Lyons and Walsh and the Dalton boy, they were young and in their prime
W:They rambled to a lonely spot where the Black and Tans did hide
W:The Republic bold they did uphold, tho' outlawed on the moor
W:And side by side they fought and died in the Valley of Knockanure.
W:
W:It was on a neighbouring hillside we listened in hushed dismay
W:In every house, in every town a young girl knelt to pray
W:They're closing in around them now with rifle fire so sure
W:And Lyons is dead and young Dalton's down in the Valley of Knockanure.
W:
W:But e'er the guns could seal his fate, young Walsh had broken thro'
W:With a prayer to God he spurned the sod as against the hill he
W:The bullets tore his flesh in two yet he cried with voice so sure,
W:"Revenge I'I1 get for my comrade's death in the Valley of Knockanure."
W:
W:The summer sun is sinking low behind the field and lea
W:The pale moon light is shining bright far off beyond Tralee
W:The dismal stars and the clouds afar are darkening o'er the moor
W:And the Banshee cried when young Dalton died in the Valley of Knockanure
