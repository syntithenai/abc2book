N: It has a good story associated with it.  R\"oj\aas Jonas wrote it when he
N: was young, and taught it to a friend of his.  Many many years later, the
N: friend played it for Jonas, who said "Wow, what a cool tune, where's it
N: from"  He had completely forgotten it.  So his friend had to re-teach
N: the tune to its composer.  Jonas then named it Ungdomssynden, "the sin
N: of youth".
