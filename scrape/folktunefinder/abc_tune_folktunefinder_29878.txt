N:Come ashore, Jolly Tar - from 'A Selection of English, Irish and
N:Foreign Airs, adapted for Fife, Violin and German Flute', volumn 1, by
N:James Aird, Glasgow, printed 1775.  The tune is reprinted in Old
N:English Dances by Frank Kidson, the tune as printed is very similar,
N:but though the pitch of the notes is the same, the key signature is
N:Dminor - one flat, rather than the two in this MS.  This version  is
N:Phrygian mode, transposed down a tone.  Or, of course, the key
N:signature could be wrong.
