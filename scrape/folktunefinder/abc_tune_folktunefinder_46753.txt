W:As noble Sir Arthur one morning did ride,
W:With his hounds at his feet and his sword by his side,
W:He saw a fair maid sitting under a tree;
W:He asked her name, and she said 'twas Mollee
W:
W:"Oh, charming Mollee, you my butler shall be,
W:To draw the red wine for yourself and for me!
W:I'll make you a lady so high in degree,
W:If you will but love me, my charming Mollee!
W:
W:"I'll give you fine ribbons, I'll give you fine rings,
W:I'll give you fine jewels and many fine things;
W:I'll give you a petticoat flounced to the knee,
W:If you will but love me, my charming Mollee!"
W:
W:"I'll have none of your ribbons, and none of your rings,
W:None of your jewels and other fine things;
W:And I've got a petticoat suits my degree,
W:And I'll ne'er love a married man till his wife dee."
W:
W:"Oh, charming Mollee, lend me then your penknife,
W:And I will go home and I'll kill my own wife;
W:I'll kill my own wife and my bairnies three,
W:If you will but love me, my charming Mollee!"
W:
W:"Oh noble Sir Arthur, it must not be so,
W:Go home to your wife, and let nobody know;
W:For seven long years I will wait upon thee,
W:But I'll ne'er love a married man till his wife dee."
W:
W:Now seven long years are gone and are past,
W:The old woman went to her long home at last;
W:The old woman died, and Sir Arthur was free,
W:And he soon came a-courting to charming Mollee.
W:
W:Now charming Mollee in her carriage doth ride,
W:With her hounds at her feet and her lord by her side.
W:Now all ye fair maids take a warning by me,
W:And ne'er love a married man till his wife dee.
