N:The Peddlar's Punch. Ed likes a title that 
N:can be taken in more than one way. In this one 
N:you don't know which punch of the peddler 
N:is the most lethal. He might pack quite a 
N:wallop if you cross him, but take just one good sup 
N:of his poteen and you'll be lucky if you 
N:don't take total leave of your senses.
