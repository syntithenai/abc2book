H: The tune is reminiscent today of the first phrase of "God rest ye
H: merry, gentlemen", and is a folk tune of widest distribution, the "tune
H: of luck-visit songs, wassails, harvest suppers, may carols and their
H: parodies, 'chestnut' having feminine symbolism.  The second title may
H: be expalined by Deloney's ballad of 1600 on Dove's roguery with the
H: women.  Although it is an awkward fit, repeating the last words of some
H: lines might make it work.
