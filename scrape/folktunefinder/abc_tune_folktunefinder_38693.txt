N:When Ed returned with us to 
N:Ireland for a visit in 1969, 
N:we were amazed at his recall of 
N:the old roads in his native region.
N:He knew which ones stood and 
N:which were changed. He never lost his 
N:childhood sense of direction. To 
N:this day, he could still show us the 
N:way to Shercock.
