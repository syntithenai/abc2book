N:Red Tom of the Hills. Tom came from somewhere
N:in the Monaghan Hills-no one knew exactly where.
N:He loved to ceili and "pack it in"
N:Tom had a "shakey" hand that could have
N:been a trial to most. But you would never know
N:it from the way Tom could slap large cuts of butter
N:on his bread at tea time. Mom Reavy said
N:Tom's hand was not to be pitied
N:"for it always shook deeper into the butter."
