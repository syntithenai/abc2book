W:On a bank of flowers in a summer day
W:For summer lightly drest,
W:The youthful, blooming Nelly lay,
W:With love and sleep opprest;
W:When Willie, wand'ring thro the wood,
W:Who for her favour oft had su'd-
W:He gaz'd, he wish'd,He fear'd, he blush'd,
W:And trembled where he stood.
W:
W:Her closed eyes, like weapons sheath'd,
W:Were seal'd in soft repose;
W:Her lips, still as she fragrant breath'd,
W:It richer dyed the rose.
W:The springing lilies, sweetly prest,
W:Wild-wanton kiss'd her rival breast:
W:He gaz'd, he wish'd,He fear'd, he blush'd,
W:His bosom ill at rest.
W:
W:Her robes, light-waving in the breeze,
W:Her tender limbs embrace;
W:Her lovely form, her native ease,
W:All harmony and grace.
W:Tumultuous tides his pulses roll,
W:A faltering, ardent kiss he stole;
W:He gaz'd, he wish'd, He  ear'd, he blush'd,
W:And sigh'd his very soul.
W:
W:As flies the partridge from the brake
W:On fear-inspired wings,
W:So Nelly starting, half-awake,
W:Awar affrighted springs.
W:But Willie, follow'd - as he should,
W:He overtook her in the wood;
W:He vow'd, he pray'd, He found the maid
W:Forgiving all, and good.
