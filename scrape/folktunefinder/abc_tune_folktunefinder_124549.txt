% Vying in popularity with "Turkey in the Straw", another American
% favorite claims our affection. Famous in song and story its origin
% has baffled investigation. An exhaustive research conducted by
% Dr. H.C. Mercer, an official of Buck's County Historical Society
% (Doylestown, Pa) relating to its history and antecedants failed of
% its purpose. All lines of inquiry extending to Kentucky, Arkansas,
% and Louisiana, ended in contradiction, and uncertainty. Furthermore,
% the quaint dialogue between the "Traveler" and the backwoods=20
% fiddler was based on nothing more substantial than a fertile
% imagination. The opening paragraph of Dr. Mercer's essay published
% in the Century Magazine -On the track of the Arkansas Traveler- is
% well worth quoting:
%        "Sometime about the year 1850 the American musical myth
%          known as "The Arkansas Traveler" came into vogue among
%          fiddlers. It is a quick reel tune with a backwoods story
%          talked to it while played, that caught the ear at sideshows
%         and circuses, and sounded over the trodden turf of fair=20
%         grounds. Bands and foreign-bred musicians were above
%         noticing it, but the people loved it, and kept time to it,=20
%         while tramps and sailors carried it across the seas to vie=20
%         merrily in Irish cabins with "The Wind that Shakes the Barley"
%         and"The Soldier's Joy".
% Though classed as a reel, the tune as printed with Dr. Mercer's clever
% essay and elsewhere, is scored as a Buckdance, and in a key much
% too low for certain instruments. The editor who is responsible for the
% setting above presented ventures to suggest that like "Old Zip Coon"
% or "Turkey in the Straw", "The Arkansas Traveler" had been evolved
% from a venerable Irish strain by some backwoods fiddler whose identity
% is lost in the oblivion which engulfed the composers of the multitude
%of Irish melodies that have survived many influences inimical to their
% preservation.
% Among the probable sources from which the tune in question may have
% been derived are the following examples:
