W:1
W:I asked my love to go with me, To take a walk a little way,
W:And as we walked and as we talked, About our golden wedding day.
W:2
W:Then only say that you'll be mine, In no other arms entwine,
W:Down beside where the waters flow, Down by the banks of the Ohio.
W:3
W:I asked your mother for you, dear, And she said you were too young.
W:Only say that you'll be mine, Happiness in my home you'll find.
W:4
W:I held a knife against her breast, And gently in my arms she pressed,
W:Crying "Willie, Oh Willie don't murder me, For I'm unprepared for eternity."
W:5
W:I took her by her lily white hand, Led her down by where the waters stand.
W:I picked her up and I pitched her in, Watched  her as she floated down.
W:6
W:I started back home twixt 12 and 1, Crying "My God, what have I done
W:I've murdered the only woman I love, Because she would not be my bride."
