% Not less popular that "Johnny I hardly knew ye" in the
% North, was "The Bonnie Blue Flag", the Southern
% National Air, which was to the boys in grey what
% "Yankee Doodle" was to the boys in blue. In Adair
% Fitzgerald's "Famous Songs" we are told the words of
% "The Bonnie Blue Flag" were written in 1862 by Mrs.
% Annie Chambers Ketchum to an Irish melody adapted
% or composed by Henry McCarthy. After a fruitless
% search in several old time collections for the now
% very rare strain it is presented as noted from the
% author's memory.
