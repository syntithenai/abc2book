W:Their groves o' sweet myrtle let Foreign Lands reckon,
W:Where bright-beaming summers exalt the perfume,
W:Far dearer to me yon lone glen o'green breckan
W:Wi' th'burn stealing under the lang, yellow broom:
W:Far dearer to me are yon humble broom bowers,
W:Where the blue-bell and gowan lurk, lowly, unseen;
W:For there, lightly tripping amang the wild flowers,
W:A listening the linnet, oft wanders my Jean.
W:
W:Tho' rich is the breeze in their gay, sunny vallies,
W:And cauld, Caledonia's blast on the wave;
W:Their sweet-scented woodlands that skirt the proud palace,
W:What are they  The haunt o'the tyrant and slave.
W:The slave's spicy forests, and gold-bubbling fountains,
W:The brave Caledonian views wi'disdain;
W:He wanders as free as the winds of his mountains,
W:Save love's willing fetters, the chains o'his Jean.
