W:Some  friends and I in a public house
W:Were playing  dominoes  one night
W:When into the room a fireman came,
W:His face all chalky white
W:"What's up" says Brown, "Have you seen a ghost"
W:"Have you seen your Aunt Moriah"
W:"Oh  my Aunt Moriah be buggered," says he,
W:"The bleeding  pubs  on fire"
W:
W:"Oh," says Brown, "What a bit of luck
W:Everybody follow me
W:It's down to the cellar if the fire's not there
W:Then we'll have a grand old spree"
W:So we all went down with good old Brown
W:And the booze we could not miss
W:And we hadn't been there ten minutes or more
W:Till we were quite like this
W:
W:  Oh, there was Brown, up side down
W:  Mopping up the whiskey on the floor
W:  "Booze, booze" the firemen cried
W:  As they come a knockin' at the door
W:  "Well don't let em in till it's all mopped up
W:  Somebody shouted, "MacIntyre"
W:  And we all got blue blind paralytic drunk
W:  When the Old Dun Cow caught fire
W:
W:Then Smith ran over to the port wine tub
W:And gave it just a few hard knocks
W:He started taking off his pantaloons
W:Likewise his shoes and socks
W:"Oh no," says Brown, "That t'ain't allowed
W:You can't do that there
W:Don't be washing your trotters in the port wine tub
W:When we got some Guinesses beer"
W:
W:Then there came a mighty crash
W:Half the bloody room caved in
W:And we were drownded by the fireman's hose
W:Though we were almost happy
W:So we got some tacks and some wet old sacks
W:And we packed ourselves inside
W:And we sat there getting bleery eyed drunk
W:When the Old Dun Cow caught fire
W:
W:It's down to the cellar if the fire's not there
W:Then we'll have a grand old spree"
W:So we all went down with good old Brown
W:And the booze we could not miss
W:And we hadn't been there ten minutes or more
W:Till we were quite like this
W:
W:  Oh, there was Brown, up side down
W:  Mopping up the whiskey on the floor
W:  "Booze, booze" the firemen cried
