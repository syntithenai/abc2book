N:Almost the same as "A la Mode de France"
H:Nonesuch was built in 1538 by Henry VIII over the demolished property
H:of the village of Cuddington, near Epsom Wells in Sussex, to be the
H:most ostentatious hunting lodge ever made.  At the very end of her
H:life, Elizabeth I visited Nonesuch, as a guest of Lord Lumley,
H:son-in-law of the Earl of Arundel, and it was reported that "there is
H:much dancing of country dances in the privy chamber at Nonesuch, before
H:the Queen's majesty, who is exceedingly pleased therewith".
