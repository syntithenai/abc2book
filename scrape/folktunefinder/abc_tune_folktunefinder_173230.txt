W:Over the montains and over the waves,
W:Under the fountains and under the graves,
W:Under floods that are the deepest, which Neptune obey
W:Over rocks which are the steepest, Love will find out the way.
W:
W:Where there is no place for the glow-worm to lie,
W:Where there is no space for receipt of a fly,
W:Where the gnat dares not venture, lest herself fast she lay,
W:But if Love comes, He will enter, and will find out the way
W:
W:You may esteem Him a child for his might,
W:Or you may deem Him a coward by his flight.
W:But if she, whom Love doth honour, be concealed from the day
W:Set a thousand guards upon her, Love will find out the way.
W:
W:Some think to lose Him by having him confin'd
W:Some do suppose Him, poor thing, to be blind;
W:But if ne'er so close you wall Him, do the best that you may,
W:Blind Love, if so ye call Him, soon will find out the way.
W:
W:You may train the eagle to stoop to your fist.
W:You may train in veigle the Phoenix of the East.
W:The lioness, you may move her to give o'er her prey;
W:But you'll ne'er stop a lover; Love will find out the way.
