W:Oh, come all ye shipmates and listen to me
W:To a story that will make you grieve
W:Of a tug that went down off Tattenham Ledge
W:'Twas on a Christmas Eve.
W:
W:The C.P. Yorke she was headin' north
W:She was headin' north for Duncan Bay
W:And though 'twas the mate stood watch at her wheel
W:'Twas the devil that guided her way.
W:
W:She was just about five miles up in the Stretch
W:When a south-east gale began to blow
W:They headed for shelter in Buccaneer Bay
W:That's the only place there was to go.
W:
W:In Welcome Pass the mate was alert
W:For sight of the marker ahead
W:But he cut 'er too short comin' out of the Pass
W:And grounded on Tattenham Ledge.
W:
W:The barge dragged the tugboat off into the deep
W:She sank twenty fathoms down
W:Only the chief and the skipper survived -
W:The five other men were drowned.
W:
W:They salvaged the tugboat and she's working yet
W:She has a new crew brave and bold
W:But she'll never forget that cold Christmas Eve
W:Nor the ghosts of the five in her hold.
