% "Col. McBain's Reel" first appeared in print in Bremner's 2nd
% Collection of Scots Reels, or Country Dances, London 1768,
% and reprinted in McGoun's Repository of Scots and Irish;
% Strathspeys, Reels, etc., Glasgow 1803. Its popularity was not
% confined to Scotland for we find it named "Duke of Clarence Reel"
% in Lavenu's New Country Dances for the Year 1798, published at
% London. A setting of this noted reel as played by the experts of the
% Irish Music Club of Chicago may be found on page 116 of O'Neill's
% Dance Music of Ireland.
% In composition and fluency of rhythm the variant above presented
% compares very favorably with the original especially when given
% expression on the fiddle in the inimitable style of the genial
% Paddy Stack from whom the manuscript was obtained.
