N:In memory of the many talented Dougherty 
N:families. First, of course there 
N:was Neil and his son John, who were 
N:from the Glenties. Neil, a very close friend 
N:of Ed's and a gifted fiddler, was 
N:a special talent. Ed praised Neil as 
N:"a little known master of his trade." 
N:The tune also comemorates Charlie 
N:Dougherty and his wife Mary ("dear people"), 
N:no relation to Neil. And finally 
N:the tune recalls John, the tinker, 
N:and his musical family from the same region of 
N:the Glenties.
