W:Translation:
W:I send a farewell from my heart to thee, thou little spot over there bey
W:d the sea,
W:To the pretty little vale of Araglin, where the wine and the ale are ple

W:Sweeter to me was the cry of the hounds there, on a m ild misty morning,
W:Than [the melody of] that man [Orpheus] who used to overcome the beasts
W:th the powers and the spells of his songs.
