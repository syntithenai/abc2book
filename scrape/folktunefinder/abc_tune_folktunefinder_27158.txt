N:In memory of the many talented Dougherty
N:families. First, of course there
N:was Neil and his son John, who were
N:from the Glenties. Neil, a very close friend
N:of Ed's and a gifted fiddler, was
N:a special talent. Ed praised Neil as
N:"a little known master of his trade."
N:The tune also comemorates Charlie
N:Dougherty and his wife Mary ("dear people"),
N:no relation to Neil. And finally
N:the tune recalls John, the tinker,
N:and his musical family from the same region of
N:the Glenties.
