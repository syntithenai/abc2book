W:Cold winter was turnin' o'er moor and o'er mountain
W:And wild was the surge on the dark rollin' sea
W:When I met aboot daybreak a bonnie young lassie
W:That asked me the road and the miles tae Dundee
W:
W:I said, "My young lassie, I canna weel tell ye
W:The road and the distance I ne'er can weel gauge
W:But if ye'll permit me tae gang a wee bittie
W:I'll show ye the road and the miles tae Dundee
W:
W:At once she consented and gave me her air-m
W:Nae a word did I spear wham that lassie might be
W:She appeared like an angel in feature and for-m
W:As she walked by my side on the road tae Dundee
W:
W:At length with the howe of Strathmartine behind us
W:The spires o' the toon in full full view we could see
W:She said, "Gentle sir, I can never forget ye
W:For showin' me so far on the road tae Dundee.
W:
W:This ring and this purse please accept as a token
W:And surely there's somethin' that ye can gi'e me,
W:That in years to come I'll the laddie remember
W:Who showed me the road and the miles to Dundee"
W:
W:I took the gold pin frae the scarf on my bosom,
W:And said, "Tak' ye this, in remembrance o' me",
W:And bravely I kissed the sweet lips o' the lassie
W:Ere I pairted wi' her on the road tae Dundee
W:
W:or:
W:(So I took the gowd pin frae the scarf on my bosom
W:And said "Keep ye this in remembrance o' me
W:So in times to come ye'll the laddie remember
W:That walked by your side on the road tae Dundee)
W:
W:So here's tae the lassie, I ne'er will forget her
W:Tae ilk a young laddie that's list'nin' tae me
W:Never be sweir to convoy a young lassie
W:Though it's only to show her the road tae Dundee
