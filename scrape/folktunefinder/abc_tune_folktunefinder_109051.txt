W:Sir John Cope trode the north right far,
W:Yet ne'er a rebel he cam naur,
W:Until he landed at Dunbar
W:Right early in a morning.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Hey Johnie Cope are ye wauking yet,
W:  Or are ye sleeping I would wit:
W:  O haste ye get up for the drums do beat,
W:  Of fye Cope rise in the morning.
W:
W:He wrote a challenge for Dunbar,
W:Come fight me Charlie an ye daur;
W:If it be not by the chance of war
W:I'll give you a merry morning.
W:
W:When Charlie look'd the letter upon
W:He drew his sword and scabbard from-
W:"So Heaven restore to me my own,
W:I'll meet you, Cope, in the morning."
W:
W:Cope swore with many a bloody word
W:That he would fight them gun and sword,
W:But he fled frae his nest like an ill scar'd bird,
W:And Johnie he took wing in the morning.
W:
W:It was upon an afternoon,
W:Sir Johnie march'd to Preston town;
W:He says, "my lads come lean you down,
W:And we'll fight the boys in the morning."
W:
W:But when he saw the Highland lads
W:Wi' tartan trews and white cokauds,
W:Wi' swords and guns and rungs and gauds,
W:O Johnie he took wing in the morning.
W:
W:On the morrow when he did rise,
W:He look'd between him and the skies;
W:He saw them wi' their naked thighs,
W:Which fear'd him in the morning.
W:
W:O then he flew into Dunbar,
W:Crying for a man of war;
W:He thought to have pass'd for a rustic tar,
W:And gotten awa in the morning.
W:
W:Sir Johnie into Berwick rade,
W:Just as the devil had been his guide;
W:Gien him the warld he would na stay'd
W:To foughten the boys in the morning.
W:
W:Says the Berwickers unto Sir John,
W:O what's become of all your men,
W:In faith, says he, I dinna ken,
W:I left them a' this morning.
W:
W:Says Lord Mark Car, ye are na blate,
W:To bring us the news o' your ain defeat;
W:I think you deserve the back o' the gate,
W:Get out o' my sight this morning.
