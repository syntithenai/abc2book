R:song
H:  In the year 1852 when I was busy drawing up from my memory, for Dr.
H:Petrie, all the airs I could thing of--and for that purpose commonly
H:carried a bit of music paper in my waistcoat pocket--I woke up from sleep
H:one night whistling this fine air in a dream: an air which I had forgotten
H:for years.  Greatly delighted, I started up: a light, a pencil, and bit of
H:paper, and there was the first bar securely captured: the bird was, as it
H:were, caught and held by the tail.  I have never seen this air written
H:elsewhere, except in one Co. Limerick Ms., where this setting however is
H:inferior to miune.  I give it here from acient memory.
W:Oh, didn't you hear of the glorious news
W:Dan Tutty the gauger was caught and thrashed
