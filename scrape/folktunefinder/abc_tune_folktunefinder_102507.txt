W:
W:Wallace out over yon river he lap,
W:And he has lighted low down on yon plain,
W:And he was aware of a gay ladie,
W:As she was at the well washing.
W:
W:What tydins, what tydins, fair lady, he says,
W:What tydins hast thou to tell unto me
W:What tydins, what tydins, fair lady, he says,
W:What tydins hae ye in the south Countrie.
W:
W:Low down in yon wee Ostler house,
W:There is fyfteen Englishmen,
W:And they are seekin for gude Wallace,
W:It's him to take and him to hang.
W:
W:There's nocht in my purse, quo gude Wallace,
W:There's nocht, not even a bare pennie,
W:But I will down to yon wee Ostler house
W:Thir fyfteen Englishmen to see.
W:
W:And when he cam to yon wee Ostler house,
W:He bad bendicite be there;
W:....

W:I am a true Scot born and bred,
W:And an auld crookit carl just sic as ye see.
W:
W:I wad gie fifteen shillings to onie crookit carl,
W:To onie crookit carl just sic as ye,
W:If ye will get me gude Wallace,
W:For he is the man I wad very fain see.
W:
W:He hit the proud Captain alang the chafft blade,
W:That never a bit o' meal he ate mair;
W:And he sticket the rest at the table where they sat,
W:And he left them a' lyin sprawlin there.
W:
W:Get up, get up, gudewife, he says,
W:And get to me some dinner in haste;
W:For it will soon be three lang days
W:Sin I a bit o' meat did taste.

W:
W:Come out, come out, now gude Wallace
W:This is the day that thou maun die;
W:I lippen nae sae little to God, he says,
W:Altho' I be but ill wordie.
W:

W:By gude Wallace he stiffly stood
W:Till ten o' the fyfteen Englishmen
W:Before the door lay in their blude

W:And he's hang'd these five upon a green
W:And on the morn wi' his merry men a'
