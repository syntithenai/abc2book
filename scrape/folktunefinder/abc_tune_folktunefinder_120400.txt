N:Ed took one of his favorite reels (McKenna's) 
N:and changed it into his extraordinary little jig. 
N:Any musician who has tried this feat knows how 
N:frustrating it can be. I'm reminded of a story 
N:once of one who tried to change a tune and failed. 
N:All too quick to take credit for his own 
N:latest "improvement" of an old tune, our would-be 
N:composer waited anxiously for the praise he 
N:so confidently expected. A crafty old judge of 
N:tunes himself was only too happy to deliver the 
N:final judgment: 
N:Son, if you left out what you put in 
N:and put back in what you left out, 
N:it'd be a good tune.
