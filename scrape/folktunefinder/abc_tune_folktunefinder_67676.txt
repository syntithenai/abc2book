N: The  McBride  family  is  large  and  far-flung,  with  relatives  living  in
N: Massachusetts,  New  Hampshire,  Missouri,  Nebraska, and Oregon.  Music runs
N: through the whole gang, and Abby McBride of Taunton, MA, for whom  this  tune
N: is written, plays it easily on her penny whistle. I think that's pretty neat,
N: don't you  I think Abby's pretty neat, too.
