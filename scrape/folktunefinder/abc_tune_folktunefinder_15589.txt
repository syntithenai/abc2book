N: Peter Hastings located the following information:
N: Sir Sydney Beckwith (1772-1831) married Miss Clementina Loughnan who was  the
N: third  daughter  of  Thomas Loughnan (a merchant in Madeira) and Philadelphia
N: Fergusson.  Thomas and Philadelphia were married on the 5th of April 1770  in
N: the Church of St Clement Danes in London.  It seems likely that Nathaniel Gow
N: (1766-1831) was captivated by Clementina on one of his many visits to  London
N: and wrote a tune in her honour.  But people often misspell her last name.
