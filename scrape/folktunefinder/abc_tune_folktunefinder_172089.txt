W:Lasses, call your lads ashore
W:Lasses, call your lads ashore
W:Lasses, call your lads ashore

W:The Bellman's called it round the town,
W:And far and near the news has flown
W:Each wife seeks out her last new gown
W:There's liberty for the sailors
W:Lasses, call your lads ashore
W:Lads ashore, lads ahore
W:Lasses, call your lads ashore
W:There's liberty for the sailors
W:
W:Our bairns shall all be dressed so nice
W:Our griddle cakes be black with spice
W:With a pound of butter for every slice
W:All for to please the sailors
W:Our empty bottles we will fill
W:To cheer each passing hour until
W:The time is up, with right good will
W:Liberty for the sailors.
W:
W:Rare fun down Mauldon's lane there'll be
W:And many a lark down Lishman's Quay
W:Tommy Hayes is sure to  get on the spree
W:When there's liberty for the sailors.
W:There'll be a battle as sure as your life
W:'Twixt Mally the Pant and the black-pudding wife
W:And Billy Reppeth'll come in at the end of the strife,
W:Hoo! Liberty for the sailors.
W:
W:Dressed in his jacket of matchless blue
W:With silver buckles and trousers new
W:With a heart that beats for his country true,
W:Liberty for the sailors.
W:Up to the Wooden Bridge and back,
W:To the Low Light shore down in a crack
W:Rambling, swaggering, away goes Jack
W:When there's liberty for the sailors.
W:
W:Now every lass will get her lad
W:And every bairn will see his dad
W:And many a mother's heart be glad
W:With liberty for the sailors,
W:And many a widow's heart rejoice
W:To see the face and hear the voice
W:So like to his, her heart's dear choice
W:Liberty for the sailors!
