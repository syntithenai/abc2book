%
% The setting of "No Surrender" above submitted, was taken
% from a manuscript volume of Irish melodies compiled by
% H.Hudson, 24 Stephens Green, Dublin in the years 1840-41.
% After the name comes the notation: "From Ordnance Survey
% of Londonderry, Vol. 1, page 197."
% From the remarks accompanying the famous old march in
% Dr. Joyce's "Ancient Irish Music Dublin 1890", we quote:
%      "It is printed in the Ordnance Memoir of Londonderry
%       where, however, it is practically inaccessible to the
%       general public, as that book is very scarce. It has long
%       been appropriated as the marching tune of the yearly
%       celebration of the shutting and opening of the gates
%       of Derry."
% It may be of interest to add that the siege of Derry occurred
% in 1689.
% We may be pardoned for remarking that Dr. Joyce's
% arrangement is in the Scale of C altho both settings were
% derived from the same scarce publication.
