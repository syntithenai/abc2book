T:The Enchanted White Duck
R:song
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:  A little boy is changed by draoidheacht or enchantment into a white duck,
H:and in this disguise he is killed and eaten by his own family.  Our servant
H:Biddy Hickey used to tell the whole story, sometimes reciting, sometimes
H:singing, sometimes chanting in a monotone: but it has all faded from my
H:memory except the following weird little fragment with its tune, which took
H:strong hold of my childhood fancy.
H:  The English folk-tale called "The Story of Orange" (for which see "Journ.
H:of the Folk-Song Soc.", Vol. II, p. 295) corresponds with this, and some
H:versions of the words come very close to the verse I give here.  But there
H:is nothing in the English air that in the least resembles our Irish tune.
W:My mamma cut me and put me in the pot;
W:My dada said I was purty and fat;
W:My three little sisters they picked my small bones
W:And buried them under the marble stones.
