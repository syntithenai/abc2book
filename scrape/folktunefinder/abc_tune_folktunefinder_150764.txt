W:Oh the winter it has passed
W:And the summer's come at last
W:The small birds are singing in the trees
W:And their little hearts are glad
W:ah, but mine is very sad
W:Since my true love is far away from me
W:
W:And straight I will repair
W:To the Curragh of Kildare
W:For it's there I'll finds tidings of my dear
W:
W:Oh the rose upon the briar
W:And the clouds that float so high
W:Bring joy to the linnet and the bee
W:And their little hearts are blessed
W:But mine can know no rest
W:Since my true love is far away from me
W:
W:All you who are in love
W:Aye and cannot it remove
W:I pity the pain that you endure
W:For experience lets me know
W:That your hearts are filled with woe
W:It's a woe that no mortal can cure
