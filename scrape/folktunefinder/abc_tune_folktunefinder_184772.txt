N:When we were recording the Waulk albums we occasionally 
N:had a break and took ourselves off to the beach. I named this 
N:reel after Raven's Cove, my favourite. The sea and rocks are 
N:always powerful  and inspiring- you get that sense of awe 
N:there that puts eveything else in perspective.This tune is on 
N:the Waulk album Um-Di-Um. 
K:Ador
