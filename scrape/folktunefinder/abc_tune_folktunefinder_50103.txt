W:When first into this country a stranger I came
W:There was no one that knew me or asked me my name
W:I came into this country to tarry for a while
W:And to leave my dear jewels alone on that isle
W:
W:A story has been reported as you may have been told
W:Of three pretty maids from my country I stole
W:But thievery and robbery oh that I do defy
W:But these three pretty fair maids I never will deny
W:
W:The first was pretty Betsy although she was poor
W:The next was lovely Nancy'the maid I adore
W:The other was black-eyed Susan the girl of my delight
W:And I'll roll her in my arms on a cold winter night
W:
W:Her eyes were like two diamonds so bright and so clear
W:Her cheeks were like the roses the first of the year
W:Though her cheeks they have been faded this past summer
W:And I fear she's in love with some other young man
W:
W:I never never knew what it was to be a slave
W:Till both my parents were dead and laid in their graves
W:When I was bound apprentice for more than seven long years
W:My master and my mistress were cruel and severe
W:
W:My mistress scarce ever spoke a kind word to me
W:Which caused my mind to wander like waves on the sea
W:But now I've regained my liberty I'll return to the girl I like
W:And I'll roll her in my arms on the cold winter nights
W:
W:Now I am married I live at my ease
W:I go when I like and I come when I please
W:I married pretty Susan for she is the girl that I like
W:And I fold her in my arms on a cold winter night
