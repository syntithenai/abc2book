T:Mopsy's Tune (the old way)
T:The Welsh Jig
R:jig
C:Welsh Trad.
H:it's a version of the Irish jig &quot;The
H:Priest and His Boots&quot; (Sagart na mBuatasi/). There's a version of it
H:in O'Neill's 1850 (#968), which is also rather similar to the version
H:in CRE II (#17), and a rather different version in CRE III (#8).
N:after #2 Aly Grogin. The jigs are odd feeling, at first, because of
N:the short A sections -- the dance needed 24 bar tunes and this is
N:what you got. so, yes, you *don't repeat the A section on &quot;Mopsy's
N:Tune&quot; ... as much as you might want to (actually, you can to
N:whatever the hell you want ;-)
