Z:Juergen Gier <Juergen.Gier@post.rwth-aachen.de>
N:This famous Scottish strathspey first appeared in John Bowie's  Collection
N:(1789). In that book it is unclear if Bowie composed the tune or not ... I
N:suspect he did.  Over the years it has been rearranged into a famous reel,
N:Dowd's  Favourite  which  was  first  recorded  by  Michael Coleman in the
N:twenties. Jerry plays both settings. He learned the Cape Breton strathspey
N:setting from Bill Lamey.
