N:No tune can adequately commemorate this
N:great fiddler. Ed felt that he was the last of the great players,
N:and the only one he ever heard who had that strange wildness in
N:his playing that only the great ones possess. Ed wrote the tune as
N:if Mike were to play it. Perhaps he alone had the tools to do
N:it complete justice.
