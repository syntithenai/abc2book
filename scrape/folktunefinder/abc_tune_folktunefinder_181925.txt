H:Air and Song from early memory.

H:  There is a song to this air written by Patrick O'Kelly, a wandering
H:peasant poet of the beginning of the last century, who discloses his nam
H:in
H:the last verse: a custom found in other songs.  (For a notice of him see
H:y
H:"Social History of Ancient Ireland," I. 451.)
H:Though many there be that daily I see
B:
M:6/8
L:1/8
W:  Of virtuous beautiful creatures,
W:With red rosy cheeks and ruby lips,
W:  And likewise comely features:
W:Yet there is none abroad or at home
W:  In country or town or plantation,
W:That can be compared to this maiden fair--
W:  The Pearl of th'Irish Nation.
W:
W:P was a part and A was an art,
W:  And T was a teacher of strangers,
W:R, I, and C make number three,
W:  And K will be keeper of my chambers.
W:K will be king when E cannot reign,
W:  Double L will lie in its station:
W:Y will be young and in perfect bloom--
W:  The Pearl of th'Irish Nation.
