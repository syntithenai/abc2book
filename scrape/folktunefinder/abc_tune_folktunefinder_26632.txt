W:S'help me goodncss gracious, don't this Dutchman love him well
W:
W:Puts in some cayenne pepper, we don't put any snuff,
W:We puts a little salt and some other kind of stuff.

W:Puts him in a barrel and takes him down the cellar,
W:Puts him in a kittle and when he begins to bile
W:Bet you forty dollars you can smell him fifty mile.
