W:There was a sailor from Dover, from Dover he came
W:He courted a fair young damsel, and Sally was her name;
W:And she being so lofty and her portion being so high,
W:All on a poor sailor love she scarce would cast an eye.
W:
W:"O Sally, dearest Sally, O Sally," then said he,
W:"I fear that your false heart my ruin it will be;
W:Without your present hatred is turned into love,
W:You'll make me broken-hearted and my ruin it will prove."
W:
W:"I cannot love a sailor, nor any such a man,
W:So keep your heart in comfort and forget me if you can.
W:I pray you keep your distance and mind your own discourse
W:For I never intend to marry you unless that I am forced.'
W:
W:But when a year was over and twelve months they was past
W:This lovely young damsel she grew sick in love at last.
W:Entangled she was all in her love, she did not know for why
W:So she sent for the young man on whom she had an eye.
W:
W:"Oh, am I now now the doctor, that you have sent for me
W:Pray do you well remember how once you slighted me
W:How once you slighted me, my love, and treated me with scorn,
W:So now I will reward you for all that you have done."
W:
W:"For what is past and gone," she said, "I pray you to forgive
W:And grant me just a little longer time for to live."
W:"Oh no, my dearest Sally, as long as I have breath,
W:I'll dance all on your grave, love, as you lie under the earth."
