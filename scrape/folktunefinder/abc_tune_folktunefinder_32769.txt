S:Henry Atkinson 1694/5 transcribed John Stokoe 1884
N:The clef and (possibly) key signature are missing, though more probably
N:either no key signature was intended or has been omitted by HA/JS.  1st
N:notes of bars 5, 13,17 and 21 are missing.  3rd note of bar 11 has a
N:faint 'D' written above, which may be either an alternative or a
N:partially erased mistake.  The first two notes of the tune also have
N:faint 'F' and 'G' above them.  It is possible that the 3th note of bar
N:14 has a faint 'A' above it
