% In the heyday of Bonaparte's renown, early in the nineteenth
% century, many song, marches, hornpipes etc were named in
% his honor in Ireland. Most of the tunes, being traditional,
% retain their popularity. It is not claimed that "Bonaparte's
% Grand March" is an Irish composition. In fact we have no
% information concerning its history or origin, but there can be
% no question as to its circulation and popularity in Ireland in
% former times. Its rescue from the oblivion of faded manuscript
% to the publicity of the printed page may endow this spirited
% march with renewed vitality.
