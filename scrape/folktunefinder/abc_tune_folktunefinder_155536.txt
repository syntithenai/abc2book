N: by  Si  Garbutt:  According  to  the  notes  to  Susan  Songer's   Portland
N: Collection,  which contains a couple of his tunes ("Spootiskerry" and "Bert
N: Ferguson"), the late Samuel Ian Rothmar Burns lived in the Shetland  Isles.
N: Ian  Burns,  as  he  was  known,  published  a book of tunes, also entitled
N: "Spootiskerry". It is the name of a farm in his family.  His daughter, June
N: Mann,  lives  in  Cunningsburgh in the Shetlands and gave the info to Susan
N: Songer. I believe I read somewhere that "spoots" are some sort of shellfish
N: -  razor  clams,  I  think  (and  a  skerry  is  a group of rocks which are
N: sometimes visible above sea-level, sometimes not, depending on  the  tide).
N: The  tune  is  sometimes  known  as  "Spoot o' Skerry" and there is a young
N: Celtic band of that name - from Canberra!
