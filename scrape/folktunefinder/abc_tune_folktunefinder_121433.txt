% This catchy strain which is a superior variant of "The Dancing Master"
% in O'Neill's Dance Music of Ireland was introduced to Chicagoans by
% John Dromey an excellent fluter, and amateur piper, whose name it
% bears. Mr. Dromey who is yet hale and hearty, was in his prime, a
% generation ago, the star of every Irish gathering, for as a
% traditional singer of Irish songs, he was unrivalled.
