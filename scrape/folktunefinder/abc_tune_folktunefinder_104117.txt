N:The way this has been strangely written down with what would normally
N:be considered to be inappropriate bar lines, lead in notes, and
N:incorrect spelling of Meg Merrilees, strongly suggests to me that this

N:indicates that the author of the MS has a "consumer's" knowledge of
N:music notation. CGP
