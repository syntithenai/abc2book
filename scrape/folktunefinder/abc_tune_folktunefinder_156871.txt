W:Oh, come, sit down close to me, my dear,
W:While I sing you a merry song.
W:'Tis now for us well over a year,
W:Since together you and I have been;
W:Since together you and I have been, my dear
W:Since together you and I have been.
W:'Tis now for us well over a year,
W:Since together you and I have been.

W:I will not sit close to you, my dear
W:Not now nor any other time.
W:You've given your love to another one,
W:And your heart no longer is mine.
W:Your heart no longer is mine, my dear,
W:Your heart no longer is mine.
W:You've given your love to another one,
W:And your heart no longer is mine.
W:
W:When your heart truly was mine, my dear,
W:You laid your head upon my breast,
W:And I listened !o the strange oaths you swore
W:That the sun it rose in the west;
W:That the sun it rose in the west, my dear.
W:That the sun it rose in the west;
W:And I listened to the strange oaths you swore
W:That the sun it rose in the west.
W:
W:There's a rose in the garden for you, my dear,
W:A rose in the garden for you.
W:When fish fly high like the birds in the sky,
W:Young men will then prove true.
W:Young men will then prove true, my dear,
W:Young men will then prove true.
W:When fish fly high like birds in the sky,
W:Young men will then prove true.
