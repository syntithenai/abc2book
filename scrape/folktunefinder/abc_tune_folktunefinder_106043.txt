% This fine air, the best known of the compositons of the great harper
% Thomas O'Connellan, was taken from "Aird's Selection of Scotch,
% English, Irish and Foreign Airs, Vol.3", published in 1788.
% O'Connellan flourished in a period when the renown of Irish harpers
% became a matter of history. After a sojourn of 20 years in Scotland,
% he returned to his native land in 1689, and died nine years later.
% As the above setting differs materially from that of Bunting in his
% second collection issued in 1809, and others much more recent,
% its introduction  among Waifs and Strays may be not without interest
% to students of Irish musical history.
