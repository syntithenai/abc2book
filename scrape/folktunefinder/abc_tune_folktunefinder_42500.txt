W:l once had a wee lass and I loved her well,
W:I loved her far better than my tongue can tell,
W:Her parents disliked me for my want of years,
W:So adieu to all pleasure since I lost my dear.
W:
W:Then I dreamt last night that my love came in ,
W:And she walked up so soft that her feet made no din.
W:I thought that she spoke and those words she did say,
W:"It won't be long now, love, till our wedding day."
W:
W:Then according to promise at midnight I rose
W:And found nothing there but the down-folded clothes,
W:The sheets they were empty, as plain as you see,
W:And out of the window with another went she.
W:
W:Oh, it's Molly, lovely Molly, what's this that you have done
W:You have pulled the thistle, left the red rose behind;
W:The thistle will wither and decay away soon,
W:But the red rose will flourish in the merry month of June.
W:
W:Then if l was a fisherman down by the seaside
W:And Molly a salmon, coming in with the tide,
W:I would cast out my net and catch her in a snare,
W:I would have lovely Molly, I vow and declare.
W:
W:Or if I was an eagle and had two wings to fly,
W:I would fly to my love's castle and it's there I would lie,
W:ln a bed of green ivy l would leave myself down,
W:With my two folded wings I would my love surround.
