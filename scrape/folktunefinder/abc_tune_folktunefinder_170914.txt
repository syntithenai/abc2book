W:It's of a false knight from the North
W:Who came a-courting me
W:He promised he'd take me unto the North land
W:And there his bride would be
W:
W:Go fetch me some of your father's gold
W:And some of your mother's fee
W:And two of the finest horses they have in the stable
W:For they have ten and thirty and three
W:
W:So she fetched some of her father's gold
W:And some of her mother's fee
W:And two of the finest horses they had in the stable
W:For they had ten and thirty and three
W:
W:Then she got up on the noble brown
W:And he on the dappled gray
W:And they rode till they came to a broad waterside
W:Two long hours before it was day
W:
W:Lie down, lie down, my Pretty Polly
W:Lie down, lie down, said he
W:For it's six king's daughters I have drowned here
W:And it's you the seventh will be
W:
W:Now strip yourself, my Pretty Polly
W:Now strip yourself, said he
W:For your clothing's too rich and ever-costly
W:For to rot in the salt of the sea
W:
W:Well turn your back to the leaves on the tree
W:And face the salt water sea
W:For it's not very right such a false-hearted youth
W:A naked woman should see
W:
W:So he turned his back to the leaves on the tree
W:And faced the salt-water sea
W:And with all the strength pretty Polly she had
W:She pushed him into the sea
W:
W:Oh help me, oh help me, my pretty Polly
W:Oh help me, oh help me, cried he
W:And I shall become your waiting man
W:I shall wait on you night and day
W:
W:Oh no, oh no, you false-hearted youth
W:Oh no, that never can be
W:If it's six king's daughters you've drowned here
W:You can rule o'er your company
W:
W:Then she got up on the noble brown
W:And led the dappled gray
W:And she rode till she came to her father's hall
W:Two long hours before it was day
W:
W:Then up bespoke her poll parrot
W:All from its cage so gay
W:Why do you travel, my pretty Polly
W:So long before it is day
W:
W:Then up bespoke her old father
W:All from his room so grey
W:Why do you chatter, my poll parrot
W:So long before it is day
W:
W:The cat was up and about my cage
W:And I could not get away
W:So I called unto Miss Pretty Polly
W:For to drive the cat away
W:
W:Well turned, well turned, my poll parrot
W:Well turned, well turned, cried she
W:For your cage I will make of the finest gold
W:And your door, fine ivory
