H:Musicians who play for set dancing know that each figure in a particular set consists of so many bars of music. So it looks more professional if musicians and dancers can finish in time together. Sometimes the musician can lose count and overshoot the runway so it is safer to ask the caller or dance tutor to give the call "House to Finish".
