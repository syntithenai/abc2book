W:Every year at least one set in the Rum & Onions repertoire completely defeats me as   
W:a player and is branded with the notation "DWL" at the top of the page. Thanks to   
W:Larry Koplik who cheerfully acknowledges the difficulty of the tunes and invites 
W:me to dance instead. I now enjoy my "DWL sets" as a well-deserved break, and 
W:the time I can appreciate how great the band sounds from the dance floor.
W:Further trivia: Larry and I were delighted to discover we are vaguely related.  
W:His wife is my stepfather's stepsister's cousin.
