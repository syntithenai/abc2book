I'll tentatively disagree with spoon, and say that I think JH might have played this swung. I think the isolated dotted groupings are there to show that the bar written |G/A/B/c/ d>B G2| is not meant to be played like a straight polka or march (as you'd assume if the dotted > wasn't there, but rather to maintain the default swing but &quot;squash&quot; that semiquaver run into the rhythm, rather like the runs of 4 semiquavers you get in strathspeys in place of triplets.
