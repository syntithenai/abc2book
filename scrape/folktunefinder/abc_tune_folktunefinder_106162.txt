% In Aird's Selections of Scotch, English, Irish and
% Foreign Airs etc this tune is designated "An Irish Jigg"
% while in the index it is named "An Irish Air". Its emphatic
% swing and antique cadences proclaim this spirited
% strain a march, altho as "The Hibernian Jig" it was
% included in O"Neill's Dance Music of Ireland 1907,
% but in a much lower key.
