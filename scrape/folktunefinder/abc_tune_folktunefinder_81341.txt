W:Where are you going to Scarboro Fair
W:Parsley Sage Rosemary and thyme,
W:Remember me to a bonny lass there
W:For once she was a true lover of mine.
W:
W:Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,
W:Without either needle or thread worked in it
W:And tell her to wash it in yonder spring
W:Where water never sprung nor a drop ran through.
