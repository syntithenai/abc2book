W:KATE DALRYMPLE (words by William Watt, 1792-1859)
W:
W:In a wee cot house far across the muir 
W:Where pease-weeps, plovers, an' waups cry dreary, 
W:There liv'd an' auld maid for mony lang years, 
W:Wha ne'er a woo-er did e'er ca', dearie. 
W:A lanely lass was Kate Dalrymple, 
W:A thrifty quean was Kate Dalrymple; 
W:Nae music, exceptin' the clear burnie's wimple, 
W:Was heard round the dwellin' o' Kate Dalrymple. 
W:
W:Her face had a smack o' the gruesome an' grim, 
W:That did frae the fash o' a' woo-ers defend her; 
W:Her long Roman nose nearly met wi' her chin, 
W:That brang folk in mind o' the auld witch o' Endor. 
W:A wiggle in her walk had Kate Dalrymple, 
W:A sniggle in her talk had Kate Dalrymple; 
W:An' mony a cornelian an' cairngorm pimple, 
W:Did blaze on the dun face o' Kate Dalrymple. 
W:
W:She span terry woo' the hale winter thro' 
W:For Kate ne'er was lazy, but eident and thrifty; 
W:She wrocht 'mang the peats, coil'd the hay, shor the corn, 
W:An' supported her sel' by her ain hard shift aye. 
W:But ne'er a lover came to Kate Dalrymple, 
W:For beauty an' tocher wanted Kate Dalrymple; 
W:Unheeded was the quean, baith by gentle and simple, 
W:A blank in existence seem'd puir Kate Dalrymple. 
W:
W:But mony are the ups an' the downs in life, 
W:When the dice-box o' fate's jumbled a' tapsal-teerie, 
W:Sae Kate fell heiress to a rich frien's estate, 
W:An' nae langer for woo-ers had she cause to weary. 
W:The Laird came a-wooin' soon o' Kate Dalrymple, 
W:The Lawyer, scrapin', bowin', fan oot Kate Dalrymple; 
W:Owre ilk woo-ers face was seen love's smilin' dimple, 
W:Sae noo she's nae mair, Kate, but Miss Dalrymple. 
W:
W:She often times thocht when she dwelt by hersel', 
W:She could wed Willie Speedyspool, the sarkin' weaver; 
W:An noo unto Will she the secret did tell, 
W:Wha for love or for interest did kindly receive her. 
W:He flung by his beddles soon for Kate Dalrymple, 
W:He brent a' his treddles doon for Kate Dalrymple; 
W:Tho' his richt e'e doth skellie an' his left leg doth limp ill, 
W:He's won the heart an' got the hand o' Kate Dalrymple.
