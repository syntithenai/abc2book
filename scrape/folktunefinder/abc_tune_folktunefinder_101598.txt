% I have not generally included ornamentation or variations - and each
% tune is notated as closely as possible to the player's performance. 
% Following from this I have not tried to 'correct' what may be variations,
% wayward versions, instrument-specific quirks etc. 
% 
% I have listed the sources that I know or remember, and have included
% a discography where relevant.
