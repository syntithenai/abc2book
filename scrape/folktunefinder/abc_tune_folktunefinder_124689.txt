% In former O'Neill publications John McFadden's setting of this reel
% was given preference, being in the florid style of that famous=20
% traditional fiddler. The version here presented memorized from lilting
% by the editor in schoolboy days, may not be devoid of interest=20
% especially as the arrangement is suited to the scales of the Highland
% or Irish warpipes.
