W: Chorus:
W: Speed bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
W: Onward the sailors cry!
W: Carry the lad that is born to be king,
W: Over the sea to Skye!
W:
W: 1. Loud the winds howl, Loud the waves roar, thunderclaps rend the air,
W: Baffled our foes stand on the shore, Follow they will not dare.
W:
W: 2. Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep, Ocean's a royal bed;
W: Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep Watch by your weary head.
W:
W: 3. Many's the lad fought on that day, Well the claymore could wield
W: When the night came, silently lay Dead on Culloden's field.
W:
W: 4. Burned are our homes, exile and death Scatter the men;
W: Yet e'er the sword cool in the sheath, Charlie will come again.
