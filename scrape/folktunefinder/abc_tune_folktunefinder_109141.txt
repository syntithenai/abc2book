W:Come listen a while and I'll sing you a song
W:Of three merry gentlemen riding along,
W:They met with Sweet Joan and to her did say
W:I'm afraid this cold morning will do you some harm.
W:
W:O no, kind sir, the maiden said
W:This cold morning will do me no harm.
W:There's one thing I crave lies betwixt your legs
W:If you give me that it will keep me warm.
W:
W:He got off his horse - she mounted it quick
W:Looking the gentleman hard in the face,
W:Says, "You knew not my meaning, you wrong understand me"
W:And away she went galloping down the green lane.
