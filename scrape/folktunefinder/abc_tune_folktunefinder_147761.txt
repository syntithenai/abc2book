N:Named for a keen observer of the music. He was one
N:of the many Donegal fiddler friends of Ed, who came
N:often to exchange tunes and old stories. Charlie had
N:a great head for the music, but not the hands to match.
N:Trying to finger a difficult passage he was often heard
N:to exclaim, "They won't go down." But this did not deter
N:Charlie from becoming an important influence in the
N:tradition at that time. He affectionately called Ed,
N:"the Doctor".
