N:Never Was Piping So Gay. The concluding line 
N:of O'Driscoll's refrain in Yeats' poem, the 
N:Host of the air. O'Driscoll dreamed that 
N:his wife Bridget was taken by the Host 
N:as he was playing harmlessly at cards with 
N:"the merry old men." When O'Driscoll 
N:awoke from his dream,all that remained of the 
N:dream was the strange unearthly sound of a pipe
N:piping away in the distant air- 
N:"And never was piping so sad, And 
N:never was piping so gay."
