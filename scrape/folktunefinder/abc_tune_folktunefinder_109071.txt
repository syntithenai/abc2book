W:The love that I have chosen was to my heart's content.
W:The salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent.
W:Repent it I shall never until the day I die
W:But the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and I.
W:
W:The very night we got married and lay upon our bed
W:A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
W:Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
W:To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
W:
W:But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
W:But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in
W:Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
W:Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
W:
W:Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
W:Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content
W:There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
W:For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
W:
W:There shall no mantle cross my back, no comb go through my hair
W:No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair
W:And I will never married be until the day I die
W:For the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and me
