N:The sad gaiety of this tune celebrates 
N:the longing of the exile for his native 
N:home. No one quite understands the 
N:irony of a happy farewell as well as the poet 
N:in Frank O'Connor's translation from the Irish: 
N:What happier fortune can one find, 
N:Than with the girl who pleases one's mind; 
N:To leave one's home and friends behind 
N:And sail on the first favoring wind.
