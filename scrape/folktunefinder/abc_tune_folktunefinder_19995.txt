W: Here they stand hand in hand
W: they've exchanged wedding bands
W: Today is the day of their dreams and their plans,
W: and all we who love them just wanted to say.
W: May God bless this couple who married today
W:
W: In good times and bad times in sickness and health
W: may they know that riches are not needed for wealth
W: and help them face problems they'll meet on their way
W: Oh god bless this couple who married today
W:
W: May they find peace of mind comes to all who are kind
W: May the rough times ahead become triumphs in time
W: May their children be happy each day
W: Oh God bless this family who started today
W:
W: As they go may they know every love that was shown
W: And as life it gets shorter may their feelings grow
W: Wherever they travel wherever they stay
W: May God bless this couple who married today
