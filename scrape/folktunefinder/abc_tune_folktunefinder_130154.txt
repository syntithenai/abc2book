H:Having enjoyed playing for Sets Ceilis all over the North with fiddle player, Charlie Woods, I composed these slides with rather zany titles. One particular Set Dance, The Ballyvourney Jig Set consists of five individual figures, and when danced non-stop consists of 552 bars of music. For any beginner, brave enough to undertake such a challenge it generally ended in disaster, like a stray sheep throwing the rest of the flock into disarray.
