N:The pause is very clearly and definitely written over the E.  In all
N:duplets and triplets the number is written in the slur.  After the
N:last
N:double bar there is the regular 'end of tune' sign  The following
N:three
N:bars are in a different hand.  No final bar line is given, but the
N:program insists on putting one in. Cherri.G.
N:I think the  number two's should be read as ordinary triplets,
N:occupying the space of two semi-quavers.As to the pause over the E, I
N:think it's a blot! CGP.
Z:vmp.Cherri Graebe.
