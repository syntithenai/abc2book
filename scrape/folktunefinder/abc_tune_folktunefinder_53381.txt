N:A favorite story of Ed's tells of 
N:Hughie, an easygoing sort who had a fierce 
N:look when he wore a certain cap. Friends would
N:take Hughie along whenever a fight was 
N:anticipated. One look from Hughie and
N:his cap would silence the most 
N:quarrelsome bullies. One night, as it
N:would happen, Hughie's friends found 
N:themselves in the worst sort of mix and quickly 
N:looked for Hughie's help. But Hughie, 
N:alas, had ventured out this time without 
N:his menacing capeen. "Oh God," one 
N:exclaimed, "somebody go fetch Hughie's cap, 
N:or there'll be hell to pay for all 
N:of us this night!"
