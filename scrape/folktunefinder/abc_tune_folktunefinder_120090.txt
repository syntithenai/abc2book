N:Ed's favorite aunt on his mother's side. She was a 
N:lively story teller who could capture 
N:the hearts of the children who heard
N:her speak. And she knew everyone who lived 
N:in her region. Ed never quite
N:finishes talking about this fascinating 
N:woman of the tradition. Much of
N:his musical inspiration has been kindled 
N:by recollections of what Aunt 
N:Ann said many years ago.
