W:Come all you men and maidens attend unto my rhyme
W:It's of a young damsel who scarce was in her prime
W:She beat the blushing roses admired by all around
W:Was lovely young Caroline of Edinburgh Town
W:
W:Young Henry was a Highland man a-courting to her came
W:And when her parents came to know, they did not like the same
W:Young Henry was offended and unto her did say
W:"Arise my dearest Caroline and with me run away.
W:
W:"We will both go to London, love, and there we'll wed with speed
W:And then lovely Caroline shall have happiness indeed."
W:Now enticed by young Henry, she put on her other gown
W:And away went young Caroline of Edinburgh Town.
W:
W:Over hills and lofty mountains together they did roam
W:In time arrived at London, far from their native home
W:Said Henry, "I will go to sea, your parents did on me frown
W:So beg your way without delay to Edinburgh Town.
W:
W:"The fleet is fitting out at Spitzhead dropping down
W:And I will join the fleet to fight for King and crown
W:The gallant tars may feel their scars or in the water drown
W:Yet I never will again return to Edinburgh Town."
W:
W:Oppressed with grief without relief this damsel she did go
W:Into the woods to eat such fruit as on the trees did grow
W:Some strangers they did pity her and some did on her frown
W:And some did say, "What made you stray from Edinburgh Town"
W:
W:There many a day she passed away in sorrow and despair
W:Her cheeks, though once like roses, were grown like lilies fair
W:She cried, "Where is my Henry" and often she did swoon
W:Crying, "Sad is the day, I ran away from Edinburgh Town."
W:
W:'Twas beneath a balmy oak where she sat down to cry
W:A-watching of the gallant ships as they were passing by
W:She gave one shriek for Henry and plunged her body down
W:And away floated Caroline of Edinburgh Town.
W:
W:A note, likewise her bonnet, she left upon the shore
W:And in the note a lock of hair, with words, "I am no more."
W:And fast asleep into the deep, the fish were watching round
W:Once comely young Caroline of Edinburgh Town.
W:
W:Come all young tender parents, ne'er try to part true love
W:You're sure to see, in some degree, the ruin it will prove
W:Likewise young men and maidens, ne'er on your lovers frown
W:Think on the fate of Caroline of Edinburgh Town.
