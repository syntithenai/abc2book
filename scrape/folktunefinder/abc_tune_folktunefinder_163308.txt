W:Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears,
W:While we all sup sorrow with the poor:
W:There's a song that will linger forever in our ears;
W:Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  It's  the song, the sigh of the weary;
W:  Hard times, hard times come again no more;
W:  Many days you have lingered around my cabin door.
W:  Oh! Hard times, come again no more.
W:
W:While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
W:There are frail forms fainting at the door;
W:Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.
W:Oh! Hard times, come a- gain no more.
W:
W:There's a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
W:With a worn heart whose better days are o'er.
W:Though her voice would be merry, it's sighing all the day.
W:Oh! Hard times, come a- gain no more.
W:
W:It's a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave,
W:It's a wail that is heard upon the shore;
W:It's a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave.
W:Oh! Hard times, come a- gain no more.
