A:Filk
W:From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design
W:Strike-slip fault and overthrust and syn- and anticline.
W:We gaze upon creation where erosion makes it known,
W:And count the countless eons in the banding of the stone.
W:Odd, long-vanished creatures and their tracks and shells are found,
W:Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground.
W:The patient stone can speak if we but listen when it talks.
W:Humans wrote the bible; God wrote the rocks.
