%% Written on September 1st, 1984, a beautiful sunny day.  Could have called it
%% "Farewell to Brookline", since I was moving out then.  Wanted to write an Irish
%% tune which switched keys between the first and second parts.  I got the key
%% change (1st part in D, 2nd part in A), but the tune turned out as a New England
%% contra!  Plays well on a mandolin, excellent whistle tune, works on backup guitar
%% or flatpicking melody with bass string dropped to D. Harmony second part.

%% 9/1/98
