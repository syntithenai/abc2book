W:Seven long years I've been bound to my trade
W:In one more I'll be free,
W:I belong to that jovial crew,
W:And no one cares for me.
W:I'll romp and I'll rove, and I'll call for my bode
W:They may all say what they will;
W:Resolved that I am, just as long as I can
W:for to drink good liquor still
W:
W:I have a good old father at home,
W:And I've cost him many a pound,
W:And now to make amends for this,
W:I'll travel the whole world round.
W:I have a good old mother at home,
W:I've caused her a many a tear,
W:And now to make amends for this,
W:I'll travel far and near.
W:
W:I have a good little sister at home,
W:And she gave me a good piece of advice,
W:Said for me to stay with my kind old parents
W:And to marry me a pretty little wife.
W:I have a good little sweetheart at home,
W:She gave me a broad piece of gold;
W:It'll neither buy me a house nor a home,
W:Nor save my soul from hell;
W:It'll only buy me a full flowing bowl,
W:That the ladies may drink their fill.
