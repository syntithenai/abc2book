% "Miss Forbes' Return" as noted by Humphrey Murphy
% in Sergt. James O'Neill's manuscripts differs not
% materially from "Miss Forbes' Farewell" as printed in
% Aird's Selections of Scotch, English, Irish and Foreign
% Airs 1782-97. This strain is no less popular in Ireland
% than it is with Highland pipers everywhere. It may be
% claimed that Murphy's variant is more Irish in
% character than the original.
