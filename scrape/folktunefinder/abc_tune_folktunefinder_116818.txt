W:To the queen of hearts is the ace of sorrow
W:He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
W:Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
W:If my love leaves me what shall I do
W:
W:Had I the store in yonder mountain
W:Where gold and silver is there for counting
W:I could not count for thought of thee
W:My eyes so full I could not see
W:
W:I love my father, I love my mother
W:I love my sister, I love my brother
W:I love my friends and relatives too
W:I'll forsake them all and go with you
W:
W:To the queen of hearts is the ace of sorrow
W:He's here today, he's gone tomorrow
W:Young men are plenty but sweethearts few
W:If my love leaves me what shall I do
