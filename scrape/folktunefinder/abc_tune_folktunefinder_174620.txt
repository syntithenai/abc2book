W:'Twas all on a cold winter's night
W:When the winds blew across the wild moor,
W:That Mary came wand'ring along with her child,
W:Till she came to her own father's door.
W:
W:"O why did I leave this dear spot,
W:Where once I was happy and free
W:And now doomed to roam without friends or a home,
W:And none to take pity on me
W:
W:"O father, dear father," she cried,
W:"Do come downstairs and open the door!
W:For the child in my arms will perish and die
W:From the winds that blow 'cross the wild moor."
W:
W:But the old man was deaf to her cries,
W:Not a sound of her voice did he hear,
W:But the watchdog did howl and tAe village bell tolled
W:And the winds blew across the wild moor.
W:
W:O how must the old man have felt
W:When he came to the door the next morn
W:And found Mary dead, but the child was alive,
W:Closely clasped in its dead mother's arms.
W:
W:With anguish he tore his gray hair,
W:While the tears down his cheeks they did roll
W:Saying, "There Mary died, once the gay village bride,
W:From the winds that blew 'cross the wild moor."
W:
W:The old man with grief pined away,
W:And the child to its mother went soon;
W:There's no one, they say, has lived there to this day,
W:And the cottage to ruin has gone.
W:
W:The villagers point out the spot,
W:Where the willows droop over the door,
W:Saying, "There Mary died, once the gay village bride,
W:From the winds that blew 'cross the wild moor."
