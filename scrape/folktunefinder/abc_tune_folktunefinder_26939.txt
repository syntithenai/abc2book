B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:There wsa a song to this air which was well known in Limerick, about a young
H:man who went out fishing, and met with better luck than he expected.  I have
H:a ballad-sheet copy of the whole song, but the first and last verses will be
H:sufficient here.  I write the air from memory.
H:  I often heard the Limerick people sing to this air Byron's two-verse poem
H:beginning "I saw thee weep".
W:As I roved out one morning down by a river side,
W:To catch some trout and salmon where the stream did gently glide;
W:Down by the brook my way I took and there by chance did spy
W:A lovely maid all in the shade, who smiled and passed me by.
W:
W:With hand in hand we walked along down by her father's place;
W:Her parents they were satisfied when first they saw my face.
W:The banns were quickly published and joined we were for life:
W:So instead of trout or salmon--O, I caught a virtuous wife.
