N: "At the end of the third summer of Ashokan in '82, I was particularly feeling the
N: post-camp syndrome of finding it hard to return to what we mistakenly call the
N: 'real world.'  I really missed the people and the joy of having music and dance
N: so much a part of my daily life.   Kind of like 'Brigadoon,' it's a world of its
N: own, separate from the rest of life.  And each summer when these things end, you
N: don't really know if it'll happen again.   So one morning I picked up my fiddle
N: and started playing the saddest lament I could come up with - as a way of saying
N: goodbye to that summer". Jay Ungar, RD 1 Box 489, West Hurley, NY 12491
N:
N: "Ashokan Farewell" is the 'goodbye' tune played at the end of each week of the
N: music and dance camp run by Jay Ungar and Molly Mason, and holds emotional
N: memories for many who have enjoyed the Ashokan experience.   Fiddle Fever's
N: arrangement of "Ashokan Farewell" was the cornerstone for the soundtrack of the
N: celebrated PBS series, "The Civil War", (Electra/Nonesuch) which won a Grammy
N: award and was nominated for an Emmy.   It's also recorded on "Songs of the Civil
N: War" (Sony/CBS); on "Waltz of the Wind"; and on "The Best of Fiddle Fever"
N: (Flying Fish).
