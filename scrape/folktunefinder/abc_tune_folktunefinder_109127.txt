W:She's like the swallow that flies so high,
W:She's like the river that never runs dry.
W:She's like the sunshine on the lee shore,
W:She loves her love but she'll love no more.
W:
W:'Twas down in the meadow this fair maid bent
W:A-picking the primrose just as she went.
W:The more she picked and the more she pulled,
W:Until she gathered her apron full.
W:
W:She climbed on yonder hill above
W:To give a rose unto her love.
W:She gave him one, she gave him three
W:She gave her heart for company.
W:
W:And as they sat on yonder hill
W:His heart grew hard, so harder still.
W:He has two hearts instead of one.
W:She says, "Young man, what have you done"
W:
W:"How foolish, foolish you must be
W:To think I love no one but thee.
W:The world's not made for one alone,
W:I take delight in everyone."
W:
W:She took her roses and made a bed,
W:A stony pillow for her head.
W:She lay her down, no more did say,
W:But let her roses fade away.
W:
W:She's like the swallow that flies so high,
W:She's like the river that never runs dry,
W:She's like the sunshine on the lee shore,
W:She loves her love but she'll love no more.
