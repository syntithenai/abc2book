N:The tune commemorates the great fiddlers of 
N:the past: Michael Coleman, Kipeen Scanlon, 
N:and a host of unheralded ones who went to the 
N:clay unrecognized. The history of Ireland is 
N:a fiddle. It alone can convey the sounds and 
N:feelings of sad gaiety that characterize the 
N:plight of that long-troubled land.
