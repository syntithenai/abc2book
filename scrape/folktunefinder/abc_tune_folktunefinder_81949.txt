T:The Foggy Dew
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:  I learned this air when I was a child.  Compare it with "Air thaobh na
H:carraige b\'aine": Petrie, Ancient Music of Ireland, p. 143.
H:Bunting, in his 1840 volume, gives a different air with the same name.
W:When I was a bachelor airy and young,
W:    I followed the bachelor's trade,
W:And all the harm that ever I done
W:    Was courting a pretty maid.
W:I courted her for the long summer season,
W:    And part of the winter too,
W:Till at length we were married--myself and my darling,
W:    All over the foggy dew.
