W:Ye Sons of North Britain that were caused for to range
W:Unto some foreign country where lands they were strange.
W:Among that great number was Daniel Monroe:
W:Straightway unto America likewise he did go.
W:
W:Two sons with his brother he caused them to stay.
W:The price of their passage he could not well pay.
W:When seven long winters had passed by and gone,
W:They asked for to leave, but money was none.
W:
W:Being discontented, no comfort they find,
W:But the thoughts of the army did run in their mind:
W:So leaving their uncle, they roamed till they found
W:A regiment of foot for America bound.
W:
W:And when they had landed in that country wild,
W:Surrounded by rebels on every side,
W:With humble submission these two brothers went
W:Unto their good captain to gain his consent.
W:
W:To which their good captain was pleased to agree
W:They might go up-country their parents to see.
W:So leaving the camp with a boy for a guide,
W:They made for the place where their parents reside.
W:
W:They travelled along till they came to a grove.
W:The leaves and the branches they all seemed to move:
W:There being two rebels that lurked in the wood,
W:They pointed their pistols where the two brothers stood.
W:
W:Lodging a bullet in each brother's breast,
W:They rushed on their prey like two ravenous beasts,
W:To take all their money and rip up their clothes,
W:And if they're not dead, for to give them some blows.
W:
W:You ravenous villains, you bloodthirsty hounds,
W:How could you have killed us before we had found,
W:Had found our dear father we sought with such care!
W:When he hears of our fate he will die of despair.
W:
W:He left us in Scotland seven twelvemonths ago.
W:Perhaps you may know him, his name is Monroe.
W:The old man astonished, in wonder he stood
W:A-gazing on his sons who lay bleeding in the wood.
W:
W:He cried out in sorrow: Oh, what have I done
W:A curse on my hands, I have slain my own son!
W:If you be my father, the young man did cry,
W:I'm glad that I've seen you before that I die.
W:
W:I'll sink beneath sorrow, give way to despair.
W:I'll linger a while till death ends my care,
W:In hopes for to meet you on a happier shore
W:Where I won't be able to kill you any more.
