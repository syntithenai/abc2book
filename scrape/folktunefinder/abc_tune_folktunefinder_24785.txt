N:One of his tunes had to pay tribute to these hills;
N:not the Fork Hill region that Paddy Kavanaugh celebrated,
N:but the same nearby hills of Monaghan that Ed's mother
N:and his Aunt Ann spoke of in childhood stories. Ed's
N:mother played no musical instrument,
N:but she could "lyddle" all the great
N:tunes of her region. This love of the tradition she
N:passed on to Ed.
