W:Oh, the streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts
W:Where the young men and maidens they do meet their sweethearts.
W:It is drinking of good liquor caused my heart for to sing
W:And the noise in yonder village made the rocks for to ring.
W:
W:At the top of this mountain, there my love's castle stands,
W:It's all overbuilt with iv'ry on yonder black sand.
W:Fine arches, fine porches, like diamonds so bright,
W:It's a pilot for a sailor on a dark winter's night.
W:
W:On yonder high mountain where the wild fowl do fly
W:There is one amongst them that flies very high.
W:If I had her in my arms, love, near the diamond's black land
W:How soon I would secure her by the sleight of my hand.
W:
W:At the bottom of this mountain there runs a river clear.
W:A ship from the Indies did once anchor there,
W:With her red flags a-flying and the beating of her drum,
W:Sweet instruments of music and the firing of her gun.
W:
W:So come all you little streamers that walk the meadows gay.
W:I will write to my own true love wherever she may be,
W:For her rosy lips entice me, with her tongue she tells me "No,"
W:And an angel might direct us, and where shall we go
W:
W:Oh, the streams of lovely Nancy are divided in three parts
W:Where the young men and maidens they do meet their sweethearts.
W:It is drinking of good liquor caused my heart for to sing
W:And the noise in yonder village made the rocks for to ring.
