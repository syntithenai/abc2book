M:7/8
N:Jutta Weber tells me this is a song tune, and that "Lesnoto" is a dance form.
N:The title may give problems on "Western" machines - the penultimate character,
N:  is a c with a caron ( - upside-down circumflex) (Unicode U010d), which
N:  doesn't exist in Latin1 (iso 8859 1), but does in, eg, Latin2. The "encoding"
N:  line above should cause abcm2ps to use this. The "abc-charset" line was proposed
N:  by one of the many standards, I don't know if any programs honour it. If you
N:  use TeX (abc2mtex), this character can be written as "$\check{c}$".
N:  I don't know what to say about this, except that Unicode Is The Answer.
