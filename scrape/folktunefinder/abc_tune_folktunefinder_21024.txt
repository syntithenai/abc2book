D:on the tape, "A Breeze Through the CONduit"
W:Now Molly was brown as a berry,
W:Her hair like the shadow at noon,
W:And her merry brown eyes could flash a surprise,
W:So the young men all danced to her tune.
W:But Molly is gone from the water,
W:No more with the lads for to talk;
W:She was drowned, she was drowned,
W:And she never was found,
W:Where the black water slaps at the rock.
