W:Over the hills I went one day,
W:A lovely maid I spied
W:With her coal black hair and her mantle so green.
W:An image to perceive.
W:Says I, "Dear girl, will you be my bride
W:And she lifted her eyes of blue
W:She smiled and said, "Young man I'm to wed
W:I'm to meet in the foggy dew."
W:
W:Over the hills I went one morn,
W:A-singing I did go.
W:Met this lovely maid with her coal-black hair,
W:And she answered soft and low:
W:Said she, "Young man, I'll be your bride,
W:If I know that you'll be true."
W:Oh, in my arms, all of her charms
W:Were casted in the foggy dew.
