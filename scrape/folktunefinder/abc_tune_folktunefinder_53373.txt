N:Yeats wrote about John O'Leary in his poem, 
N:"September 1913." At that time, Ed had just 
N:left Ireland, because his parents saw no 
N:future in the farm and no real opportunities there 
N:for their six children. The poet mourns the 
N:passing of O'Leary in the 
N:1913 poem and the passing, too, 
N:of all the things O'Leary stood for: 
N:"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, 
N:It's with O'Leary in the grave." 
N:Ed believed in O'Leary-and in Emmet and 
N:Tone. This reel celebrates 
N:their Ireland: O'Leary's Ireland.
