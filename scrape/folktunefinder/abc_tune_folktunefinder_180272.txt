%Posted June 15th 2000 at abcusers by David Barnert as an example of
%"tunes that have clear key signatures (as expressed in sharps &
%flats) but elusive tonics (and, therefore, modes)"
%   Here is what David says about the tune:
%The second is another Morris dance from Bacon, "The Old Woman Tossed
%Up" (Bucknell), which is either in C major or F lydian. I generally
%play this one on the pipe & tabor to avoid having to choose chords
%for it.
