N: Let's have a cei-lidh come wi' me, dance to the mus-ic mer-ry, mer-ry mus-ic
N: Come let us make the raf-ters ring, Let's have a real old high-land fling.
N: Swing your partner pas-de-bas, Have a drappie slan-te-mhath,
N: You will agree it's just the thing, So join in the fun and hooch and sing,
N: Mo-rag will dance with Will Macrae, Dance they will till break of day,
N: Kirsty and Duncan, John and Jean, the grandest crowd you've ever seen.
N:
N: The band they will play an eightsome reel, Laddies will shout and lassies squeal
N: Some folk will get a wee bit fu', Still they will dance the whole night thro',
N: Soon you will find you're all aglow, Heel for heel and toe for toe
N: Drinking quickly from your glass, Before you chase another lass
N:
N: Tammy will play his pipes sae braw, Play till the wind he canna blaw,
N: An' Donal' who is whisky fill't, Will whip away poor Tammy's kilt
N: Now folk are silent ev'ry one, Seems that the Ceilidh's owre and done,
N: But Tam blaws his pipes, folks hooch and then, The Ceilidh starts all owre again.
N: drapple = wee drink
N: Slan te mhath = good health
