W:As I cam' by yon auld house end
W:I saw twa corbies sittin thereon,
W:The tane unto the t'other did say,
W:"O whare sall we gae dine the day" (repeat last line)
W:
W:"Whare but by yon new fa'en birk,
W:There, there lies a new slain knight;
W:Nae mortal kens that he lies there
W:But his hawks and hounds, and his ladye fair.
W:
W:"We'll sit upon his bonny breast bane,
W:And we'll pick out his bonny gray een;
W:We'll set our claws intil' his yallow hair
W:And big our bow'r, it's a' blawn bare.
W:
W:My mother clekit me o' an egg,
W:And brought me up i' the feathers gray,
W:And bade me flee where'er I wad,
W:For winter wad be my dying day.
W:
W:Now winter it is come and past,
W:And a' the birds are biggin' their nests,
W:But I'll flee high aboon them a'
W:And sing a sang for summer's sake.
