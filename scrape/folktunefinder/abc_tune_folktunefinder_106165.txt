% The term "Croppy" grew from the custome of the English and
% Scotch reformers in 1795, who cut their hair short. The same
% custom was adopted by the reformers in Ireland; and hence all
% those who wore their hair short were denominated "Croppies",
% and were the marked objects of government vengeance. In
% truth, clipped hair constituted secondary evidence of treason,
% and was sufficient to cause the arrest and ill treatment of any
% person daring enough to adopt it.
