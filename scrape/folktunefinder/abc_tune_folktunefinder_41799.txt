W:As I roved down through Irish town one evening last July,
W:The mother of a soldier in tears I did espy,
W:Saying: "God be with you, Johnny dear,though you are far from me;
W:For you my heart is breaking, since you went to the Crimee.
W:
W:"O Johnny, I gave you schooling; I gave you a trade likewise
W:That you need not have joined the army had you took my advice.
W:You need not have gone to face your foes where cannons loudly roar,
W:And thousands fall their victims upon the Russian shore.
W:
W:He joined the fourteenth regiment, it being a gallant corps;
W:They landed safe while mentioned upon the Russian shore.
W:He fought in four engagements with the loss of men each day,
W:O many's the mother shedding tears for them that's far away.'
W:
W:"We fought at Balaklava where we did not succeed;
W:Down in the Valley of Inkerman where thousands there did bleed.
W:'Twas on the hcights of Alma that we did gain the day,
W:Young Johnny mentioned all to me, though he is far away."
W:
W:The fighting at Sebastopol would give the world surprise;
W:It being so hard to take it, the enemy were so wise.
W:But Paddy's sons with British guns their valor did display,
W:And togethcr with the sons of France, thank God, we gained the day.
W:
W:Now to conclude and finish, I mean to end my song;
W:I'm thankful to the great God that I've survived so long.
W:Likewise unto you, mother dear, for me you did adore,
W:I'm happy to return again to childhood's home once more.
