N:When we compare this to the version in O'Lochlainn's Irish Street Ballads,
N:we can see it's a further development of the situation, and omits any mention of
N:drinking - a trait that links O'Lochlainn's version to the original "Way to Dundee" MS
B:From Paddy Graber, Vancouver, 1967; Learned in Ireland,
B:ca 1929-1930, from David Young, Omagh Co., Tyrone.

W:The wind was a howling high on the mountain side,
W:Dark were the clouds o'er the deep rolling sea;
W:I spied a wee lass a coming the road to me,
W:Enquiring the road to sweet Carnloch Bay.
W:
W:Her features were fair, like an angel she appeared to me
W:Little I knew who the colleen might be;
W:Said I, "My wee lass, sure I'll come along with you
W:And show you the road to sweet Carnloch Bay."
W:
W:"Kind sir," says she, "I don't mean to flatter you
W:Never you think that I'm just making free;
W:But happy I'd be if you'd come along with me
W:And show me the road to sweet Carnloch Bay."
W:
W:She gave me her arm, we passed through the keening gate
W:In through the churchyard and down by the sea;
W:We listened awhile to gear the sad wheeon [1] cry
W:As we journeyed the road to sweet Carnloch Bay.
W:
W:At last we did come to her destination
W:The time came for parting between her and me;
W:She lifted her lips, I kissed them right manfully
W:As we said our farewell at sweet Carnloch Bay.
W:
W:Slan lath, colleen og, I cannot forget you now,
W:Your features are etched deep in my memory.
W:My heart gives a leap when I hear the wheeon cry,
W:Going the road to Sweet Carnloch Bay.
