W:Ma'am dear, did ye never hear of pretty Molly Brannigan
W:In troth, then, she's left me and I'll never be a man again.
W:Not a spot on my hide will a summer's sun e'er tan again
W:Since Molly's gone and left me here alone for to die.
W:
W:The place where my heart was you'd aisy rowl a turnip in,
W:'Tis large as all Dublin, and from Dublin to the Divil's glen:
W:If she'd wish'd to take another, sure she might have left mine back again
W:And not have gone and left me here alone for to die.
W:
W:Ma'am dear, I remember when the milking time was past and gone
W:We strolled thro' the meadow, and she swore I was the only one
W:That ever she could love, but oh! the base and cruel one,
W:For all I that she's left me here alone for to die.
W:
W:Ma'am dear, I remember when coming home the rain began,
W:I wrapt my frieze-coat round her and ne'er a waistcoat had I on
W:And my shirt was rather fine-drawn, but oh! the false and cruel one,
W:For all that she's left me here alone for to die.
W:
W:The left side of my carcase is as weak as water gruel, ma'am,
W:There's not a pick upon my bones, since Molly's proved so cruel ma'am
W:Oh! if I had a blunder gun, I'd go and fight a duel, ma'am,
W:For sure I'd better shoot myself than live here to die.
W:
W:I'm cool an' determined as any salamander, ma'am,
W:Won't you come to my wake when I go the long meander, ma'am
W:I'll think myself as valiant as the famous Alexander, ma'am
W:When I hear ye cryin' o'er me, "Arrah! why did ye die"
