C: Turlough O'Carolan
R: planxty
S: Pgmulvaney 
Z: Probably the first tune composed by Carolan.  Si Bheag and Si Mhor are two
Z: hills in County Leitrim associated in the local folklore with two bands of
Z: fairies continually at war with each other.
N: In fact, I am told, Carolan most likely arranged, but did not compose, the
N: tune. I also believe the Faeries involved have since gone to the negotiations
N: table, and are now making a mint in the post-peace-process-tourist-trade.
N: PS: Sometimes referred to as "she begs for more". but never by me, of
N: course. Must be reference to Guiness...
