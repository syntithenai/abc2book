T:Spla-Foot Nancy
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
H:There was a half-comic song to this air, composed in my own time by a local
H:bard, ridiculing a neighbour, a big bony ungainly girl, universally known as
H:"Spla-foot Nance."  I remember just one verse:
W:There was Spla-foot Nancy
W:To try her chance,
W:  She took a notion of a man:
W:She stood on her toes
W:And says she: "Here goes;
W:  I'll cock my hat at Shaun MacCann."
W:So Spla-foot Nance
W:Began to dance
W:  And off to Shaun's little house she ran;
W:But his mother rushed out
W:With a terrible shout:
W:  "How daar you come coortin to Shaun MacCann!"
