B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
H:From the singing of Joe Martin of Kilfinane Co. Limerick, 1852.
H:He sang an Irish song to it, of which this is the first verse:
W:Mo chreach a's mo dh\'iachairt gan ce\'o draoichte air na b\'oithribh,
W:A's go siubhalfhainn san o\'idhche le'm chroidhe geal na gl\'oire.
W:Mo ph\'ocaidhe bheith a l\'ionadh le geal ph\'isidhe cr\'oineach,
W:N\'a s\'asacht s\'ud dom'inntinn agus l\'uidhe s\'os le c\'obach.
W:
W:Alas and alas, that there is not a fairy-fog on the roads,
W:And that I might walk in the night with thy fair sweetheart of glory.
W:If my pockets were to be filled with white crown pieces--
W:That would  not content my mind, and to be married to a clown.
