Q:300
N:This tune came out of the fire one night and into my viola 
N:with its odd phrasing. Here I've transposed it for the violin, 
N:so it's a 5th higher. To get the depth it really should be played 
N:on the viola in E dorian. This tune is on the Waulk album 
N:Um-Di-Um.The last two bars are meant to be in 6/4.
K:Bdor
