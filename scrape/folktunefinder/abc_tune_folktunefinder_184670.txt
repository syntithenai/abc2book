T: Random
C: James Hill ()
O: Believed to be a Northumbrian Pipe Tune
S: John Skelton East Durham 2002
Z: lesl -- glauber fixed the ABC a little so it looks like a normal 3-part jig
R: jig
M: 6/8
L: 1/8
T:Rondeau
H:The vast majority of Hill's compositions are hornpipes in flat keys.
H:Since this tune shows up as "Rondeau" in a different manuscript,
H:there's at least a chance that it was assimilated from some
H:passing French saylor instead of composed by Hill.
H:Another theory for the name is that Random is the name of a race horse.
