W:Are you going to Scarborough Fair
W:  Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
W:Remember me to one who lives there
W:  For once she was a true love of mine
W:
W:Tell her to make me a cambric shirt...
W:Without any seam or fine needlework..
W:
W:Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well
W:Where water ne'er sprung nor drop of rain fell
W:
W:Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn
W:Which never bore blossom since Adam was born
W:
W:Now he has asked me questions three
W:I hope he will answer as many for me
W:
W:Oh, will you find me an acre of land
W:Between the sea foam and the sea sand
W:
W:Oh, will you plow it with a lamb's horn
W:And sow it all over with one peppercorn
W:
W:Oh, will you reap it with a sickle of leather
W:And tie it all up with a peacock's feather
W:
W:And when you have done and finished your work
W:Come to me for your cambric shirt
