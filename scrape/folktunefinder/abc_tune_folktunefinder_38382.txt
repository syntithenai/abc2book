N:They are surely not from Windsor; 
N:and they are merry
N:because their mena are off 
N:"flutherin' with some old tunes,"
N:while they have the kitchen 
N:to themselves.  They have some
N:work of their own to do, 
N:and no one will escape them
N:in the end.  When the gossiping 
N:wives make merry, there's hell
N:to pay in every quarter.
