T:Lilli Burlero
S:Digital Tradition, liliburl
N:This immensely catchy tune first turned up in 1641 in Ulster.
N:In 1688, King James II designated Colonel Richard Talbot,
N:a Catholic, as Earl of Tyrconnel and sent him to Ireland as Lord
N:Lieutenant. This enraged the English and Irish Protestants, who
N:took up this song - "For James is de dog and Tyrconnel's de ass" - as
N:their protest. It's been claimed that this tune "whistled James
N:from the throne of England." A nice, if apocryphal, line. RG
N:Tune also called "The Protestant Boys"

W:
W:Ho, by my Soul, it is a Talbot;
W:And he will cut all de English throat,
W:
W:Though by my soul, de English do prate,
W:De law's on dere side and de divil knows what,
W:
W:But if Dispense do come from de Pope,
W:We'll hang Magna Carta and demselves on a rope.
W:
W:And de good Talbot is now made a Lord,
W:And with his brave lads he's coming aboard.
W:
W:Who all In France have taken a swear,
W:Dat day will have no Protestant heir.
W:
W:O but why does he stay behind
W:Ho, by my soul, 'tis a Protestant wind,
W:
W:Now that Tyrconnel is come ashore,
W:And we shall have Commissions galore.
W:
W:And he dat will not go to de Mass,
W:Shall be turned out and look like an ass,
W:
W:Now, now de hereticks all will go down,
W:By Christ and St. Patrick's the nation's our own.
W:
W:Dere was an old prophecy found in a bog,
W:Dat our land would be ruled by an ass and a dog.
W:
W:So now dis old prophecy's coming to pass,
W:For James is de dog and Tyrconnel's de ass.
