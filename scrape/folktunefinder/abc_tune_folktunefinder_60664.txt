W:As I went out through Dublin City
W:At the hour of twelve o'clock at night
W:Who should I see but a Spanish lady
W:Washing her feet by candle light
W:First she washed them and then she dried them
W:Over a fire of ambry coals
W:In all my life I never did see
W:A maid so sweet about the soles
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Whack fol the toor a loor a laddy
W:  Whack fol the toor a loor a lay
W:  Whack fol the toor a loor a laddy
W:  Whack fol the toor a loor a lay
W:
W:I stopped to look but the watchman passed
W:Says he, "Young fellow, the night is late
W:Along with you home or I will wrestle you
W:Straight away through the Bridewell gate"
W:I threw a look to the Spanish lady
W:Hot as the fire of ambry coals
W:In all my life I never did see
W:A maid so sweet about the soles
W:
W:As I walked back through Dublin City
W:As the dawn of day was o'er
W:Who should I see but the Spanish lady
W:When I was weary and footsore
W:She had a heart so filled with loving
W:And her love she longed to share
W:In all my life I never did see
W:A maid who had so much to spare
W:
W:Now she's no mot for a puddle swaddy
W:With her ivory comb and her mantle so fine
W:But she'd make a wife for the Provost Marshall
W:Drunk on brandy and claret wine
W:I got a look from the Spanish lady
W:Hot as a fire of ambry coals
W:In all my life I never did meet
W:A maid so sweet about the soles
W:
W:I've wandered north and I've wandered south
W:By Stoney Batter and Patrick's Close
W:Up and around by the Gloucester Diamond
W:And back by Napper Tandy's house
W:Old age has laid her hands upon me
W:Cold as a fire of ashy coals
W:But where is the lonely Spanish lady
W:Neat and sweet about the soles
W:
W:As I was leaving Dublin City
W:On that morning sad of heart
W:Lonely was I for the Spanish lady
W:Now that forever we must part
W:But still I always will remember
W:All the hours we did enjoy
W:But then she left me sad at parting
W:Gone forever was my joy
