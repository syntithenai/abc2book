W:On March the sixth in sixty three we sailed from Queenstown Quay
W:A gallant band of Fenian men bound for Amerikay
W:While journeying with that gallant band, as you may plainly see
W:We were forced to go from sweet Cloghroe down Erin's lovely Lee
W:
W:For six long months we ploughed the sea, from Queenstown Quay in Cork
W:Just like an arrow through the sky till we landed in New York
W:Them Yankee boys with stars and stripes came flocking down to see
W:That gallant band of Fenian men from Erin's lovely Lee
W:
W:Then one of them stepped up to me and he asked me did I know
W:The hills of Tipperary or the Glen of Aherlow
W:Or could I tell where Crowley fell, his native land to free
W:And the tower that Captain Mackey sacked, down Erin's lovely Lee
W:
W:He also asked me did I know where Wolfe Tone's body lay
W:Or could I tell the resting place of Emmet's sacred clay
W:What did I know of Michael Dwyer, the Wicklow mountain lion
W:And the three Manchester martyrs - Allen, Larkin and O'Brien
W:
W:Yes I can tell where Crowley fell, 'twas in Kilclooney Wood
W:And the tower that Captain Mackey sacked, 'twas by his side I stood
W:When he gave the word, we raised the sword and made the tyrant frown
W:And we raised the green flag o'er our heads, the harp without the crown
W:
W:When I was leaving Ireland, I passed through sweet Kildare
W:And if I do not now mistake, Wolfe Tone is buried there
W:In coming down through Dublin Town, we passed Glasnevin too
W:And its there young Robert Emmet lies, a patriot loyal and true
W:
W:But now I'm tired of roving and the seas I will cross o'er
W:To feel the clasp of honest hands when I return once more
W:When I go home to sweet Cloghroe the boys will welcome me
W:And we'll help to float a Fenian boat, down Erin's lovely Lee.
