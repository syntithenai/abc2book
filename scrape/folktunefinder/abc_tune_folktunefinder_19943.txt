N:"The 'Great Waltz of China' was a forgotten pundit's winning submission to the 1985
N:Ashokan Celtic Week Original Tune Title Competition.  Later that summer, during
N:Northern Week, I sat alone one dawn at the piano in the Ashokan dance hall and wrote
N:a tune to go with the name.  (Attentive listeners will note a judiciously pentatonic
N:melody ensnared midst a decidedly Western harmonic substrate.)  A mystery of music:
N:that one heart's sad and lonely moments may help another's sun rise some day."
