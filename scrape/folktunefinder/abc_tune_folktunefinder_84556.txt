H:One of two tunes commemorating a large commercial building built in
H:1609 in competition with the Royal Exchange.  Because there was another
H:tune by this title, it was renamed "The New New Exchange" (1665) and
H:"The New Royal Exchange" (1670).
W:I'll go no more to the New Exchange, there is no room at all
W:It is
W:so throng'd and crowded by the gallants of Whitehall
W:But I'll go to
W:the Old Exchange, where old things are in fashion
W:For now the Kew's
W:become the shop of this blessed Reformation
W:Come, my new Courtiers,
W:what d'ye lack  Good consciences  I you do
W:Here's long and wide,
W:the only wear, the straight will trouble you
K:GDor
