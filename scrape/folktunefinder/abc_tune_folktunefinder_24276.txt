N:Who can forget the impassioned speech of
N:O'Killigan in O'Casey's Purple Dust,
N:especially when he sets out to
N:woo Avril away from her British lord.
N:O'Killigan has only the simple
N:things in his favor. But Avril finally
N:succumbs to his grand talk as
N:he urges her "to spit out what's here"
N:and make a home with him out
N:in the west of Ireland where they'll
N:both find "things to say and
N:things to do, and love at the endings."
