W:Oh! Have you heard the news of late
W:About our great original state
W:If you have not, I will relate
W:The grand Darwinian Theory.
W:Take care as you saunter along the street
W:How you tread on the dust beneath your feet;
W:You may crush a cherub in embryo sweet
W:For each atom may hold a germ complete,
W:Which, by some mystical process slow
W:And selective power, to a monkey grow,
W:And from that to a man, the truth to show
W:Of the grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:Oh! Hokey, pokey, Kanuwan
W:From nothing to something, from monkey to man
W:Oh! This is the great developing plan
W:Of the grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:The beginning of all was a little cell
W:Composed of what substance, no one can tell,
W:Endowed with the power to develop and swell
W:Into general life by this theory.
W:With a power to select what it wished to be
W:A fungus or flower, a bush or a tree,
W:A fowl of the air or a fish of the sea,
W:A cow or a sheep, a bug or a flea,
W:Or, if tired of these it may change its plan
W:Be a cat or a dog or O-rang-oo-tan,
W:But culminating, at last, in a man
W:By this grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:Oh! Hokey, Pokey, pow'r of selection,
W:Choose yourself your particular section,
W:A peasant, or lord with a great connection;
W:By the grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:Your attention, ladies, let me win it;
W:Just think of this theory for a minute,
W:Is there really not something distressing in it ---
W:To think that you sprang from a monkey
W:That delicate hand was a monkey's paw
W:Those lovely lips graced a monkey's jaw,
W:Those handsome ankles, so trim and neat
W:One time surmounted a monkey's feet!
W:Those sparkling eyes a monkey did lend,
W:That graceful form from one did descend
W:From a monkey you borrowed the Grecian bend,
W:By this grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:Oh! Hokey, pokey, protoplasm
W:'Tween monkeys and men there is no chasm
W:Why shouldn't you clasp them to your bosom
W:They're infant men, in theory.
W:
W:Some murderers we, far worse than Cain,
W:For darker deeds our character stain;
W:For thousands of brothers we've eaten and slain
W:By the grand Darwinian theory.
W:While sitting at breakfast, and picking the wing
W:Of a pigeon or grouse, or some other thing,
W:Or dining on mutton --- or lamb, in the spring ---
W:Or on salmon or trout, or on cod or on ling...
W:Gaze into the future and, say, can't you see
W:What horrible cannibals we all must be,
W:Devouring the flesh, which may yet become we,
W:By the grand Darwinian theory.
W:
W:Oh! Hokey, pokey, ringo-ging
W:The cannibal islands once had a King
W:Who ate his own kin; but to us he's no thing
W:When compared in the light of this theory.
W:
W:But why should the theory end with man
W:If he has been less, surely more he can
W:And should be, by the great developing plan
W:Of the grand Darwinian theory.
W:Why should he not on this earth yet be
W:An angel, or god, like Mercury
W:With a wing on each shoulder, each ankle and knee
W:Oh! how delightful then it will be
W:When sighing, and wishing your sweetheart to see
W:To wipe your beak, and just upwards flee
W:Like birds --- and meet your love on a tree
W:On the top of a hill, by this theory.
W:
W:Oh! Hokey, pokey, ringo-ging,
W:The world then literally on the wing,
W:No street cabs needed, or any such thing
W:By the grand Darwinian theory.
