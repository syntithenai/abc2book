N:Ed was to a fair once in Rosslea and heard 
N:this whistler. He had a 
N:whistling range that could 
N:easily match the register 
N:of a fiddle or flute. And he had 
N:all the embellishments of a great 
N:traditional player, too. He sold fish 
N:in the market places and charmed 
N:his customers with choice 
N:tunes-many of his own making.
