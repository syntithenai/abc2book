C:Ed Reavy
R:Reel
N:Reilly had a wild look and a fondness for
N:cheating at cards. Before the night was
N:finished you could bet your
N:last skin of a potato that Reilly would
N:be stirring up trouble. No one
N:knew his first name. He was one
N:of the "White Hill people" from a
N:region beyond the northern borders
N:of Ed's farmland.
