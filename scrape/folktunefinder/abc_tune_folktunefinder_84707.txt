Q:200
H:Simpson feels that the surviving tune is not the one which had some
H:currency in Elizabethan days.  He points out that wrenchings of accent
H:are necessary to accomplish the fit of Playford's dance tune to a
H:curious fragment of text found in the 18th century Percy folio MS, a
H:source of dubious authenticity itself.
H:Came you not from
H:Newcastle
H:Came yee not there away &c
H:It is quite possible that
H:this dance was inspired by William, Duke of Newcastle, a royalist who
H:remained in London and bent his interests towards the theatre during
H:the interregnum.
