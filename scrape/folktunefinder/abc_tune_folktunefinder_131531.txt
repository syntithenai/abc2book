W: Oh, here's to the lassies, we love them so well,
W: Though some are regular tartars.
W: Here's to their stockings and here's to their shoes,
W: And here's to their bonny green garters.

W: Women:
W: Oh, here's to the laddies, we love them so well,
W: though some are very slow starters.
W: Off with their baldricks and off with their bells,
W: And to hell with their bonny green garters.
