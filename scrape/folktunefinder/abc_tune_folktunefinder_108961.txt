Q:3/8=150
W:I am a little beggarman, a begging I have been
W:For three score years in this little isle of green
W:I'm known along the Liffey from the Basin to the Zoo
W:And everybody calls me by the name of Johnny Dhu
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Of all the trades a going, sure the begging is the best
W:  For when a man is tired he can sit him down and rest
W:  He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
W:  But to slip around the corner with his old rigadoo
W:
W:I slept in a barn one night in Currabawn
W:A shocking wet night it was, but I slept until the dawn
W:There was holes in the roof and the raindrops coming thru
W:And the rats and the cats were a playing peek a boo
W:
W:Who did I waken but the woman of the house
W:With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse
W:She began to frighten and I said boo
W:Sure, don't be afraid at all, it's only Johnny Dhu
W:
W:I met a little girl while a walkin out one day
W:Good morrow little flaxen haired girl, I did say
W:Good morrow little beggarman and how do you do
W:With your rags and your tags and your auld rigadoo
W:
W:I'll buy a pair of leggins and a collar and a tie
W:And a nice young lady I'll go courting by and by
W:I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them with blue
W:And an old fashioned lady I will make her too
W:
W:So all along the high road with my bag upon my back
W:Over the fields with my bulging heavy sack
W:With holes in my shoes and my toes a peeping thru
W:Singing, skin a ma rink a doodle with my auld rigadoo
W:
W:O I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night
W:The fire is all raked and now tis out of light
W:For now you've heard the story of my auld rigadoo
W:So good and God be with you, from auld Johnny Dhu
