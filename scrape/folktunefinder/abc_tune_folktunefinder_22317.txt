W:I ainse loved a lass and I loved her sae well
W:That I hate all others that spoke of her ill
W:But now she's rewarded me ill for my love
W:She's gone tae get wed tae another
W:
W:When I saw my love tae the kirk go
W:Wi bride and bridemaidens they made a fine show
W:And I followed after, my heart filled wi woe
W:To see my love wed tae another
W:
W:When I saw my love sit doon tae dine
W:I sat doon beside her and poured oot the wine
W:And I drank tae the lassie that shoulda been mine
W:But she's gone tae be wed tae another
W:
W:The men of yon forest, they ask it o' me
W:How many strawberries grow in the salt sea
W:I answer them back wi a tear in ma e'e
W:How many ships sail in the forest
W:
W:Go dig me a grave, both long, wide and deep
W:And cover it over wi florets sae sweet
W:And I'll turn in for to take a long sleep
W:And maybe in time I'll forget her
W:
W:And they dug him a grave, both long, wide and deep
W:And they covered it over wi florets sae sweet
W:And he's turned in for to take a long sleep
W:And maybe by now he's forgot her
