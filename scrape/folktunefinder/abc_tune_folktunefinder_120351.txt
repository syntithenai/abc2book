N:Ed learned some of the basics of 
N:fiddle playing from this 
N:old Cavan friend who died in 1969 
N:(just a short time after our visit there). 
N:It was also through Pat that Ed 
N:(and his brother George) joined the local 
N:fife and drum corps in Cootehill. The tunes 
N:he learned stimulated an interest 
N:in the old marches. Pat also taught 
N:him a few traditional tunes that he 
N:himself had mastered on the fiddle.
