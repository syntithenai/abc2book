T:The Beautiful Little Vale of Araglin
B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song
A:Waterford
O:Irish
H:  The araglin is a small river in the Co. Waterford flowing through a very
H:pretty glen, the subject of an Irish song to this air, of which I have a
H:full copy: written by a Waterford man living in England.  The first verse is
H:given here.
W:Sl\'an do chuirim o'm chroidhe leat, a bhaile tar taoide anonn,--
W:Go gleannt\'an Araglin aoibhinn mar a scaiptheare an fionn 'sa leann;
W:Ba bhinne liom gl\'or na ngadhar ann gach maidin bhog aoibhinn che\'odhach
W:'N\'a an te \'ud do mharbhadh na m\'ilte le dartaibh a's draoidheacht a cheoil
W:
W:Translation:
W:I send a farewell from my heart to thee, thou little spot over there beyond the sea,
W:To the pretty little vale of Araglin, where the wine and the ale are plentifully poured out.
W:Sweeter to me was the cry of the hounds there, on a m ild misty morning,
W:Than [the melody of] that man [Orpheus] who used to overcome the beasts with the powers and the spells of his songs.
