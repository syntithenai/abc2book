N: This tune goes with one of the best-known Morris dances.  It is also a good jig
N: for other dances, usually in AABB form.  The B phrase bears a strong resemblance
N: to a certain Christmas carol, and at Morris dances you will hear words like:
N: __ Hark! the herald angels sing, __
N: __ Glory to the Morris Ring. __
N: Sometimes assorted other things are praised by the angels.
