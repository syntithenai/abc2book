W: 1. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound That saved a wretch like me.
W:     I once was lost but now am found, Was blind but now I see.
W: 
W: 2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, And grace my fears relieved,
W:     How precious did that grace appear, The hour I first believed.
W: 
W: 3. Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come.
W:     'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far, And grace will lead me home.
W: 
W: 4. When we've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining as the sun,
W:     We've no less days to sing God's praise Than when we'd first begun.
W: 
W: 5. Yea, when this heart and flesh shall fail, And mortal life shall cease,
W:     I shall possess within the vail, A life of joy and peace.
W: 
W: 6. The world shall soon dissolve like snow, The sun refuse to shine;
W:     But God, who called me here below, Shall be forever mine.
