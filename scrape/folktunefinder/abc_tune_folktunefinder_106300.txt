% "The Piper's Maggot", as this old tune was called, first appeared in
% print in "Rob't Bremner's Collection of Scots Reels and Country
% Dances,  Edinburgh 1758". As the word "Maggot" which means
% an odd fancy or whim is obsolete in this age, the change of name
% is permissible. The tune was printed in Aird's Selections etc.,
% London 1797, and in later publications somewhat varied.
