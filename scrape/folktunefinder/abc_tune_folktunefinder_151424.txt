H: An early 17th century song retells Ovid's myth of the pursuit of
H: Daphne, who was turned into a laurel tree to prevent violation by
H: Apollo.  Bernini's spectacular sculpture of the moment of Daphne's
H: transformation had been created in Tome in 1622-24, the subject being
H: popular in baroque art.  Apollo was also known as Phoebus.
W: When Daphne from fair Phoebus did fly
W: The west wind most sweetly did blow in her face
W: Her silken scarf scarce shadowed her eyes
W: The God cried, O pity! and held her in chace
W: Stay, Nymph, stay, Nymph, cries Apollo, tarry and turn thee, Sweet Nymph, stay
W: Lion nor Tiger doth thee follow, turn thy fair eyes, and look this way
W: O turn, O pretty sweet, and let our red lips meet
W: O pity me, Daphne, pity me,
W: &c.
