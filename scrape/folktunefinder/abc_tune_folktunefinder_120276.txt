N:Ed has long cherished a love for the
N:written and spoken word. He might have
N:been a poet if his educational opportunities
N:had taken a different route. One of his earlier
N:verses talks of this lassie from Killencare:
N:Though frost may come and the winter's snow,
N:And bitter winds down the mountains blow,
N:I'll see you here again, my dear,
N:When spring comes 'round to Killencare.
