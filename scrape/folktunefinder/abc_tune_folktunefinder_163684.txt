S:Daniel Dow, Ancient Scotish Music, 1778 or 1783
N:Dow attributes this to the harpist Rory Dall (who may have been two
N:people, one of them Irish and one Scottish a hundred years apart, or
N:they may both have been the same Irishman, there are several competing
N:stories all asserted with utter authoritativeness).
N:Dow printed it in a keyboard arrangement with a godawful bass line which
N:I have left out.
N:Works pretty well on the alto flute or the ud (it's quite similar to some
N:classical Middle Eastern compositions); I haven't heard anyone but me play it.
