W:Now then, shipmates, come gather and join in my ditty
W:Of a terrible battle that's happened of late
W:When each Union tar shed a tear of sad pity
W:When he heard of the once-gallant Cumberland's fate.
W:
W:O, the eighth day of March told a terrible story
W:And many brave tars to this world bid adieu,
W:Our flag it was wrapped in a mantle of glory
W:By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew.
W:
W:On the ill-fated day, about ten in the morning,
W:The sky it was clear and bright shone the sun.
W:The drums of the Cumberland sounded a warning
W:That told every seaman to stand by his gun.
W:
W:Then an ironclad frigate down on us came bearing,
W:And high in the air the Rebel flag fiew.
W:The pennant of treason she proudly was wearing,
W:Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew.
W:
W:Then up spoke our captain with stern resolution,
W:Saying, "Boys, of this monster, now, don't be afraid (dismayed)
W:We've sworn to maintain our beloved Constitution,
W:And to die for our country we are not afraid'"
W:
W:Our noble ship fired, our guns dreadfully thundered;
W:Our shot on the Rebel like hail we did pour.
W:The people on shore gazed, struck with terror and wonder,
W:As our shot struck her side and glanced harmlessly o'er.
W:
W:Now, the pride of our Navy can never be daunted,
W:Though the dead and the wounded our decks they did strcw
W:"We'll die at our quarters or conquer victorious: ''
W:Was answered in cheers by the Cumberland's crew.
W:
W:"We've fought for the Union, our cause it is glorious.
W:To the Star Spangled Banner we'll ever prove true.
W:We'll be wept for by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters
W:And never forgotten,"  sang the Cumberland's crew.
