%In my opinion this tune should be notated in 3/2! -SW
% The above code was written using Phil Taylor's BarFly abc reader/converter/player program.
% Other abc converters (e.g. abc2ps) may require everything after the word "bass" to be
% deleted in the V:2 header line for correct display of notes the bass clef, or require that
% the M: and K: fields be repeated directly under the V:1 header line to display the meter
% and key signature on both staffs.  Some abc MIDI players (e.g. abc2midi) will not play
% multiple-voiced abc code.  -SW
