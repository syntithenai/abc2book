W:1. I went to the fair of Bellaghy,
W:   I bought a wee swag of a pig,
W:   I gathered it up in my arms,
W:   and danced the swaggering jig.
W:   And it's high to the top of the heather,
W:   and high to the but of the sprig,
W:   and high to the bonnie wee lassie
W:   who danced the swaggering jig.
W:2. As I went to the fair of Bellaghy,
W:   I bought a wee slip of a pig,
W:   and being down by the poor house,
W:   I whistled the swaggering jig.
W:   And it's high to the cups and the saucers,
W:   and high to the butter and bread,
W:   and high to the bonnie wee lassie
W:   who danced the swaggering jig.
W:3. I being down by the poor house,
W:   I whistled so loud and so shrill,
W:   I made all the fairies to tremble
W:   that lived around Corcoran's hill.
W:   And it's high to the top of the heather
W:   and high to the but of the sprig,
W:   and high to the bonnie wee lassie
W:   who danced the swaggering jig.
