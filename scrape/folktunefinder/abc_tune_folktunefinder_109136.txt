W:The stormy scenes of winter incline to frost and snow.
W:And dark shades over the centres where the stormy winds do blow
W:You are the girl I've chosen for to be my only dear;
W:Your scornful heart is frozen or else locked up, I fear.
W:
W:One night I went to see my love; she proved most scornfully,
W:I asked her for to marry, but she would not heed to me.
W:The night is almost spent, my love, it's near the break of day,
W:So now I want an answer; my dear, what do you say
W:
W:If I must tell you plainly, I'll lead a single life;
W:I never thought it suitable for me to be your wife;
W:So take this for an answer and for yourself provide,
W:For I've another more suitable, and you I'll lay aside.
W:
W:Oh, you have stores of riches, and more you hope to gain,
W:And you have my fond wishes, but these you do disdain.
W:Your riches will not last you, they'll melt away like snow;
W:When poverty does cross you, you'll think of me, I know.
W:
W:I'll steer my course for Flanders, I'll lead a single life,
W:And with my bold commander, my gun shall be my wife.
W:And when I do get money, to a tavern I will go,
W:And drink a health to Flora, although she answered no.
W:
W:The small birds they are singing so sweetly and so fine:
W:My joys they would be springing if Flora was but mine:
W:But still this life is pleasant, and love must have its fill
W:This world is wide and handsome, if you don't, some other will.
