W:It's a rosebud in June, and the violets in full bloom
W:The small birds are singing love songs from each spray.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  We'll pipe and we'll sing, Love,
W:  We'll dance in a ring, Love.
W:  When each lad takes his lass,
W:  All on the green grass,
W:  And it's all to plow
W:  Where the fat oxen graze low;
W:  And the lads and the lasses do sheepshearing go.
W:
W:Oh their flesh it is good, it's the best of all foods
W:And their wool it will clothe us and keep our backs from the cold.
W:
W:Here's the ewes and the lambs, here's the hogs and the rams.
W:And the fat withers too they will make a fine show.
