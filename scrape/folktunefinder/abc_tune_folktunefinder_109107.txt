W:Will you go to the rolling of the stones
W:Or the dancing of the ball
W:Or will you go and see pretty Susie
W:And dance among them all
W:
W:I will not go to the rolling of the stones
W:Or the tossing of the ball
W:But I will go and see pretty Susie
W:And dance among them all
W:
W:They hadn't danced but a single dance
W:More than once or twice around
W:Before the sword at her true love's side
W:Gave him his fatal wound
W:
W:They picked him up and carried him away
W:For he was sore distressed
W:They carried him and buried him all in the greenwoods
W:Where he was wont to rest
W:
W:Pretty Susie she came awandering by
W:With a tablet under her arm
W:Until she came to her true love's grave
W:And she began to charm
W:
W:She charmed the fish out of the sea
W:And the birds out of their nests
W:She charmed her true love out of his grave
W:So he could no longer rest
W:
W:Will you go to the rolling of the stones
W:Or the dancing of the ball
W:Or will you go and see pretty Susie
W:And dance among them all
W:
W:I will not go to the rolling of the stones
W:Or the tossing of the ball
W:But I will go and see pretty Susie
W:And dance among them all
