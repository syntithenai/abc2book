W: John Barleycorn to the sea's gone down
W:    On a ship both bold and new
W: The thirst to slake of Captain Drake
W:    And all his loyal crew
W: To venture brave through wind and wave
W:    The Spaniard for to halt
W: And though he die of Spanish grape
W:    He'll live as English malt.
W:
W: Chorus:
W: So we'll strike him down and we'll bind him round
W:    And we'll serve him worse than that
W: We'll grind his bones between two stones
W:    And we'll bung him in a vat
W: Then we'll drink his health in nut brown ale
W:    And raise our glasses high
W: For before that he can live again
W:    John Barleycorn must die.
W:
W: John Barleycorn to the courtin's gone
W:    All dressed in fine array
W: In pewter clad from toe to head
W:    To win a lady gay
W: The poetry that he declaims
W:    Will stand him in good stead
W: For the ladies there do all declare
W:    They love it more than bread.
W:
W: John Barleycorn's to the hangman gone
W:    This tale I will unfold
W: For robbing loyal Englishmen
W:    Of their silver and their gold
W: In a grave unmarked by cross or stone
W:    John Barleycorn is lain
W: 'Til summer's rains have come and gone
W:    And he rises up again.
