W:A beautiful damsel of fame and renown
W:A gentleman's daughter from Monaghan town
W:As she went through the barracks this beautiful maid
W:Stood up in her coach to see dragoons on parade
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Fare ye well, Enniskillen, I must leave you for a while
W:  And all thy fair waters and Erin's green isle
W:  And when the wars are over, I'll return in full bloom
W:  And they'll all welcome home their Enniskillen dragoons
W:
W:They were all dressed up the like of gentleman's sons
W:With their bright shining rapiers and carabine guns
W:Their bayonets fornemst them, oh she saw them full soon
W:Just because that she loved an Enniskillen dragoon
W:
W:She looked to the bright sons of Mars on the right
W:Their armor outshining the stars of the night
W:"Oh Willie, dearest Willie, you have 'listed full soon
W:In the royal, loyal Enniskillen dragoons"
W:
W:"Oh Flora, dearest Flora, your pardon I crave
W:Both now and forever, you know I am your slave
W:But your parents they have slighted me, morning, night, and noon
W:Just because that you loved your Enniskillen dragoon"
W:
W:"Oh Willie, dearest Willie, head not what they say
W:For children their parents must always obey
W:And when you've left Ireland, they'll soon change their tune
W:Sayin' 'The good Lord be wi' ye, Enniskillen dragoon'"
