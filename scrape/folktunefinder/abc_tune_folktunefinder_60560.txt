W:Kind friends, you must pity my horrible tale,
W:An object of pity, l'm looking quite stale,
W:I gave up my trade selling Wright's Patent Pills
W:To go hunting gold in the dreary Black Hills.
W:
W:  Don't go away, stay at home if you can,
W:  Stay away from that city, they call it Cheyenne,
W:  For big Wallipee or Comanche Bill
W:  They will lift up your hair on the dreary Black Hills
W:
W:The roundhouse at Cheyenne is filled every night
W:With loafers and bummers of most every plight;
W:On their backs is no clothes, in their pockets no bills,
W:Each day they keep starting for the dreary Black Hills.
W:
W:I got to Cheyenne, no gold could I find,
W:I thought of the lunch route l'd left far behind;
W:Through rain, hail, and snow, froze plumb to the gills,
W:They call me the orphan of the dreary Black Hills.
W:
W:Oh, I wish the man who started this sell
W:Was a captive, and Crazy Horse had him in hell.
W:There's no use in groaning or swearing like pitch,
W:But the man who would stay here is a son of a bitch.
W:
W:Kind friend to conclude my advice I'll unfold
W:Don't go to the Black Hills a hunter for gold
W:Railroad speculators their pockets you'll fill
W:By taking a trip to the dreary Black Hills
W:
W:  Don't go away, stay at home if you can,
W:  Stay away from that city, they call it Cheyenne,
W:  For old Sitting Bull or Comanche Bill
W:  They will take off your scalp on the dreary Black Hills.
