B:Joyce, P. W.; "Old Irish Folk Music and Songs"
R:song air
H:  This air has clung to my memory from the dim days of childhood.  I

H:Dublin, and commemorates some forgotten Dublin tragedy.
W:'Twas in the end of King James's Street
W:Young Square Brown and Miss King did meet.

W:She plunged into the Liffey that runs so deep,
