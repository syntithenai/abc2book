P:A
% This A is exactly as played by Jim Morrison.  Note that there are 25 beats.
% On the tape of George Peterson the A is played only once.  Jim Morrison
% has embellished the tune so that it sounds good when played several times.
% JM plays the intro several times over as the dancers walk on, and having
% an odd number of beats means that the dancers step on the opposite foot
% each time the tune starts over.
