W:1. Dash-ing through the snow, in a one horse o-pen sleigh.
W:O'er the fields we go, laugh-ing all the way.
W:Bells on bob-tail ring, ma-king spir-its bright.
W:What fun it is to ride and sing a sleigh-ing song to-night.
W:
W:Chorus:
W:Jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells, jin-gle all the way.
W:Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse o-pen sleigh. Hey!
W:Jin-gle bells, jin-gle bells, jin-gle all the way.
W:Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse o-pen sleigh.

W:2. A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride,
W:And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side.
W:The horse was lean and lank. Misfortune seemed his lot.
W:We ran into a drifted bank, and there we got upsot.
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:3. A day or two ago, the story I must tell.
W:I went out on the snow and on my back I fell.
W:A gent was riding by, in a one horse open sleigh
W:He laughed at me as I there laid, but quickly drove away.
W:(Chorus)
W:
W:4. Now the ground is white. Go it while you're young.
W:Take the girls along and sing this sleighing song.
W:Just bet a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed.
W:Hitch him to an open sleigh, and "crack!" you'll take the lead.
W:(Chorus)
