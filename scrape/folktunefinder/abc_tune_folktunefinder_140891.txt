B: Bob's Note Book 10 #119
N: Mary Lou Philbin and Charlie Clarke are two lovely people, good friends, from
N: Loudon, N.H., (just outside of Concord) who, as Ossian USA (603-783-4383) are
N: doing a wonderful job as performer agents, concert producers, and sellers  of
N: traditional  Irish music, both written and recorded.  They are relatively new
N: in the business, but a great  deal  of  their  extensive  offerings  is  only
N: available  from them in the states.  They are the agents for my new band "Old
N: New England," and I'm glad this opportunity came along for me to help promote
N: their business! Good luck, you guys.  (Hope you like your new waltz! :-))
