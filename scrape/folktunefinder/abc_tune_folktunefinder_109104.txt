W:There was an old lady lived over the sea
W:And she was an island queen
W:Her daughter lived off in a new country
W:With an ocean of water between
W:The old lady's pockets were full of gold
W:But never contented was she
W:So she called on her daughter to pay her a tax
W:Of three pence a pound on her tea
W:Of three pence a pound on her tea
W:
W:"Now mother dear mother," the daughter replied,
W:"I shan't do the thing you ax.
W:I'm willing to pay a fair price for the tea,
W:But never the three-penny tax."
W:"You shall," quoth the mother, and reddened with rage,
W:"For you're my own daughter, you see,
W:And sure 'tis quite proper the daughter should pay
W:Her mother a tax on her tea,
W:Her mother a tax on her tea."
W:
W:And so the old lady her servant called up
W:And packed off a budget of tea;
W:And eager for three pence a pound, she put in
W:Enough for a large familie.
W:She ordered her servants to bring home the tax,
W:Declaring her child should obey,
W:Or old as she was, and almost woman grown,
W:She'd half whip her life away,
W:She'd half whip her life away.
W:
W:The tea was conveyed to the daughter's door,
W:All down by the ocean's side;
W:And the bouncing girl pour'd out every pound
W:In the dark and boiling tide;
W:And then she called out to the Island Queen,
W:"Oh, mother, dear mother," quoth she,
W:"Your tea you may have when 'tis steep'd quite enough
W:But never a tax from me
W:But never a tax from me
