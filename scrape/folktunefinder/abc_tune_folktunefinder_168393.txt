W:Johnny: Oh, Mollie, Oh Mollie, would you take it unkind
W:        For me to sit by you and tell you my mind
W:        For my mind is to marry and never to part
W:        For the first time I saw you, you wounded my heart.
W:
W:Mollie: Yes, you may be seated and say what you will
W:         For I've time a-plenty, will listen, be still;
W:         The subject of marriage means much in my life
W:         Should I need a husband and you want a wife.
W:
W:Johnny:  Oh Mollie, consider for you sure understand
W:         That love now is speaking, O heed her command;
W:         We will ramble together in ways of true love
W:         Until life is past, then renew it above.
W:
W:Mollie:  Put your horse in the stable and feed him some hay,
W:         Come and seat yourself by me so long as you may,
W:         For who would be hasty in matters like this,
W:         Repent at our leisure, the true object miss
W:
W:Johnny:   My horse is not hungry and won't eat your hay,
W:          So fare you well, Mollie, I'll be on my way.
W:          You take all things lightly, my heart like a toy
W:          Toss about like a plaything and count it a joy.
W:
W:Mollie:   You really surprise me, for all this is new,
W:          I need time for thought and consider your view.
W:          I will marry for love or not wed at all,
W:          My mate will be waiting and answer my call.
W:
W:Johnny:   A meeting is a pleasure but parting is grief,
W:          An inconstant lover is worse than a thief,
W:          For a thief can but rob you and take all you have
W:          But an inconstant lover can lead to the grave.
W:
W:Mollie:   My heart you have wounded, but wounds they will heal,
W:          And this changes all things, you know how l feel,
W:          When you fall from your high horse and could happy be ,
W:          So whatever happens, just remember me.
W:
W:Johnny:   The grave it will rob you and turn you to dust,
W:          So where's a fair lady, a young man to trust
W:          A cuckoo's a pretty bird and sings as she flies,
W:          Yes she brings us glad tidings and tells us no lies.
W:
W:Mollie:    Now don't be presumptuous, all things have two sides,
W:           There's nothing worth while if it's never been tried.
W:           I know what you have said in some cases is true
W:           But my love for you, Johnny, will sure change your view!
