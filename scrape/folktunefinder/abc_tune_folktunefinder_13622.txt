H: A malamute is a large wolf-like dog bred to pull sleds in Alaska.
H: In the privacy of their packs - especially during full moons  -
H: they also perform a strange ritual that the local people say
H: resembles dancing. Malamutes seem to favor Kerry sets, but things
H: get a little complicated sometimes because of the "2 feet human /
H: 4 paws dog" discrepancy that gets discussed on the dance list a lot.
