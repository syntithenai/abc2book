W:As we was sailing all on the salt seas,
W:We hadn't sailed months past but two or three,
W:Not before we saw ten sail of Turks,
W:All men-o'-war full as big as we.
W:
W:"Pull down your colours, you English dogs!
W:Pull down your colours, do not refuse.
W:Oh, pull down your colours, you English dogs
W:Or else your precious life you'll lose!"
W:
W:Our captain being a valiant man,
W:And a well-bespoken young man were he:
W:"Oh, it never shall be said that we died like dogs,
W:But we will fight them most manfully!"
W:
W:"Go up, you lofty cabin boys,
W:And mount the mainmast topsail high,
W:For to spread abroad to King George's fleet
W:That we'll run the risk or else we'll die!"
W:
W:The fight begun 'bout six in the morning,
W:And on to the setting of the sun.
W:Oh, and at the rising of the next morning,
W:Out of ten ships we couldn't see but one.
W:
W:Oh, three we sank and three we burned,
W:And three we caused to run away,
W:And one we brought into Portsmouth harbour,
W:For to let them know we had won the day.
W:
W:If anyone then should enquire
W:Or want to know our captain's name,
W:Oh, Captain Wellfounder's our chief commander
W:But the Royal Oak is our ship by name.
