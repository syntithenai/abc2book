N: James Early and John McFadden from ca 1901-4, was reissued mistakenly as  a
N: Patsy Touhey recording on a Skylark cassette.  D:Joanie Madden's "The Songs
N: of the Irish Whistle" H:Bunting prints it as  a  song,  attributed  to  one
N: David  Murphy,  in  the  service  of  Lord  Mayo  "long before the times of
N: Carolan." The song is entitled "Inspiring  Fount  of  Cheering  Wine!"  The
N: lyrics  (a  literal  translation  from the Irish, says Bunting) seem rather
N: affected-- even to a wine loving Frenchman.
W: Inspiring fount of cheering wine!
W: Once more I see thee flow:
W: Help me to raise the lay divine,
W: Propitiate thy Mayo.
W: Mayo! whose valour sweeps the field,
W: And swells the trump of fame,
W: May Heav'n's high power the champion shield!
W: And deathless be his name!
