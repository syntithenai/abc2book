%%%%  Another old standby.  
%%%%  This tune is "The High Road to Linton" at half-speed.
%%%%  The way I play it, there's a G chord in bar 12 (fourth
%%%%  bar of the second turn).  But not everybody agrees with
%%%%  this (the tune doesn't require it).
%%%%  Cathie's version is quite a bit livelier than the notes 
%%%%  here would indicate.
%%%%  See Chorus.abc for notes on construction
