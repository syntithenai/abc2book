T: Marry When You're Young
S: John Doherty
N: The C in the 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th appears to be in between C flat and
N: C sharp.  Fiddlers should know what I'm talking about.  The second four
N: measures of each part present variations on the first four that John
N: played, but he didn't necessarily play them in this order.
D: John Doherty, The Star of Donegal, Folktracks 75
