W:A north country maid up to London has strayed
W:All though with her nature it did not agree
W:And she's wept and she's sighed
W:And she's wrung her hands and cried,
W:Oh I wish once again in the north I could be.
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  For the oak and the ash,
W:  And the bonny ivy tree
W:  All flourish and bloom
W:  In my north country.
W:
W:How sadly I roamed and lament my dear home,
W:Where lads and lasses are making the hay
W:Where the bells they do ring
W:And the little birds do sing,
W:And the maidens and meadows are pleasant and gay.
W:
W:No doubt if I please, I could marry with ease
W:For where bonnie lasses are, lovers will come
W:But the lad that I wed,
W:Must be North country bred,
W:And must carry me back to my North country home.
