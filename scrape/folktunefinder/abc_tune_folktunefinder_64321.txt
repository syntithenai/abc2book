W:"Tell me, tell me, Sean O'Farrell, tell me why you hurry so"
W:"Hush mavoughal, hush and listen," and his face was all aglow
W:"I bear orders from the captain, get you ready quick and soon
W:With your pike upon your shoulder for the rising of the moon"
W:
W:"Tell me, tell me, Sean O'Farrell, where the gatherin' is to be"
W:"Near the old spot by the river, right well known to you and me"
W:"One more thing, the signal token" "Whistle up the marching tune
W:For our pikes must be together by the rising of the moon"
W:
W:Out  from many a mud-walled cabin, eyes were lookin' through  the night
W:Many a manly heart was throbin' for the blessed morning light
W:A cry arose along the river, like some banshee's mournful croon
W:And a thousand pikes were flashing by the rising of the moon
W:
W:All along the shining river one black mass of men was seen
W:And above them in the night wind floated our immortal green
W:Death to every foe and traitor.  Onward, strike the marching tune
W:And hurrah me boys for freedom, it's the rising of the moon
W:
W:Well they fought for dear old Ireland, and full bitter was their fate,
W:Oh what glorious pride and sorrow fills the name of ninety-eight.
W:But thank God e'en now are beating hearts in mankind's burning noon,
W:Who will follow in their footsteps, at the rising of the moon.
