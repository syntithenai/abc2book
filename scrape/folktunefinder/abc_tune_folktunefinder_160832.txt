W:I'm a poor married man and I'm near broken-hearted
W:My wife she has left me and she's gone away
W:We had a misfortune, so she and I parted
W:Now I'll tell you what happened to her the other day
W:
W:Women are weak, they should mind their possessions
W:I think now with grief, mad me it will send
W:For she's gone away with a German Musicianer
W:Who goes about crying: Pianos to mend
W:
W:  Chorus:
W:  Fol-the-rol, fol-the-rol, fol-the-rol, laddie
W:  All sorts of tunes and things he could play
W:  There's many a good tune played on an old fiddle
W:  And this to my wife the old German did say.
W:
W:It happened one day this old German Musicianer
W:Came through our streets crying: "Pianos to mend"
W:My wife's piano being out of condition
W:Straightway the boy for the old German did send.
W:
W:He knocked at the door and he said most politely
W:"I think, ma'am, it's here you are needing repairs
W:Please, ma'am, I've called to mend your piano."
W:"All right," said my wife: "Will you please walk upstairs."
W:
W:She took him upstairs, showed him her piano
W:Ad with the old German seemed greatly amused,
W:And when he had seen it, he said to my Hannah,
W:I think, ma'am, your music's not very much used.
W:
W:He touched it, he handled it, both over und under
W:Sharp as a needle, as light as a cork;
W:With all sorts of tools he pulled it asunder
W:And rattled away with his old tuning fork.
W:
W:When I came home she told me the story
W:And said the old German had been there all day
W:He'd worked very hard to mend her piano
W:And do what she would he'd not taken her pay.
W:
W:I thought it was strange when she told me the story
W:And said the old German was ever so kind
W:Would you ever believe that this old German sausage
W:Before going away left his trade-mark behind
W:
W:I swre and I tore at my darling wife  Hannah
W:With grief and with rage I'm sure no one can tell
W:I told her to hop it and take her piano
W:And likewise to take the old German as well
W:
W:So come all young married men, don't take too much spooning
W:For all women want is to handle your pelf
W:So if ever your wife's piano wants tuning
W:Just take my tip, boys, and tune her yourself.
