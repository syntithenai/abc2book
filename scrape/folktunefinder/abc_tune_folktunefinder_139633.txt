W:Black is the color of my true love's hair
W:Her lips are like some rosy fair
W:The purest eyes and the neatest hands
W:I love the ground whereon she stands
W:
W:I go to the Clyde for to mourn and weep
W:But satisfied I never can sleep
W:I'll write to you in a few short lines
W:I'll suffer death ten thousand times
W:
W:I know my love and well she knows
W:I love the grass whereon she goes
W:If she on earth no more I see
W:My life will quickly fade away
W:
W:A winter's past and the leaves are green
W:The time has past that we have seen
W:But still I hope the time will come
W:When you and I will be as one
W:
W:Black is the color of my true love's hair
W:Her lips are like some rosy fair
W:The purest eyes and the neatest hands
W:I love the ground whereon she stands
