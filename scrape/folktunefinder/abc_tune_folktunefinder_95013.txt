N:No key signature is given, but it is written on the same page as Lord
N:Cornwallis's March, in a different handwriting, starting part way along
N:a line which has the key signature and the last couple of bars of LCM,
N:I think it is intended to follow on in the same key.  The lines of the
N:stave in the B music are almost non-existent in places.  The second
N:four quavers in the first full bar are dubious, and the four B's in the
N:next bar might be C's
