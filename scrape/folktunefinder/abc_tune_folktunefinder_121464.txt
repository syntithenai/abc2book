% Altho McGoun's tune was at hand for years, and was not known to
% our traditional musicians, I hesitated to claim it as Irish, until
% O'Farrell specifically notes it as being Irish in his Collection for
%the  Irish or Union Pipes. Few variants, while preserving a distinct
% strain, differ so widely in their development. O'Farrell was a
% renowned Irish piper who took part in operatic performances on
% the London stage late in the 18th Century. SEE #159.
