T:O'Leary's Ireland

C:Ed Reavy
R:Reel
N:Yeats wrote about John O'Leary in his poem,
N:"September 1913." At that time, Ed had just left Ireland, because
N:his parents saw no future in the farm and no real opportunities there
N:for their six children. The poet mourns the passing of O'Leary in the
N:1913 poem and the passing, too, of all the things O'Leary stood for:
N:"Romantic Ireland's dead and gone, It's with O'Leary in the grave."
N:Ed believed in O'Leary-and in Emmet and Tone. This reel celebrates
N:their Ireland: O'Leary's Ireland.
