W:Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
W:That saved a wretch like me.
W:I once was lost, but now am found,
W:Was blind, but now I see.
W:
W:'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
W:And grace that fear relieved;
W:How precious did that grace appear
W:The hour I first believed.
W:
W:Through many dangers, toils, and snares
W:I have already come;
W:'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far,
W:And grace will lead me home.
W:
W:When we've been here ten thousand years
W:Bright shining as the sun;
W:We've no less days to sing God's praise
W:Than when we first begun.
