W:What is this that I can see
W:With icy hands taking hold on me
W:I am death and none can excel
W:I'll open the doors to heaven and hell.

W:  Chorus:
W:  Oh, death. Oh death
W:  Can't you spare me over til another year.
W:
W:Oh, death, someone would pray,
W:Couldn't you call some other day
W:God's children prayed, the preacher preached,
W:The time of mercy is out of your reach,
W:
W:I'll fix your feet so you can't walk
W:I'll lock your jaw so you can't talk
W:Close your eyes so you can't see,
W:This very hour, come go with me.
W:
W:Death, I come to take the soul,
W:Leave the body and leave it cold,
W:To drop the flesh off of the frame,
W:The earth and worms both have a claim.
W:
W:Mother, come to my bed,
W:Place a cold towel upon my head.
W:My head is warm, my feet is cold,
W:Death is moving upon my soul.
W:
W:Oh, death, how you treating me,
W:Close my eyes so I can't see.
W:You hurt my body,  you make me cold
W:You ruined my life right out of my soul.
W:
W:Oh, death, please consider my age,
W:Please don't take me at this stage,
W:My wealth is all at your command,
W:If you will move your icy hand.
W:
W:The old, the young, the rich or poor,
W:All alike with me, you know;
W:No wealth, no land, no silver, no gold,
W:Nothing satisfies me but your soul.
