As said previously, I feel that 4/4 (or 2/4) suits these marches much better than the density (blackiness) of transcribing them in 2/4, but that was the 'old' way.  You could also change the meter, K:, to any of these in the ABCs, to 4/4 or 2/4, and set the value length, L:, as 1/4, 1/8 or 1/16...  For this transcription in A, as one example, you could change it so:
M: 4/4
L: 1/4
R: march
K: A Major
