W:We were traveling north to sing and play
W:For friends that we had never met
W:Been working hard and didn't speak
W:The sky was grey and threatened wet
W:And I dreamed that I saw unicorns
W:Dreamed I saw them wild and white
W:their sudden beauty lit the world
W:Like a star will light a winter's night
W:
W:Pure as love with manes of milk
W:They danced and pranced and cried aloud
W:Bright as rainbows round the stars
W:Their eyes were soft and sad and proud
W:
W:And I wept for the wild and dirty world
W:To which this beauty now was lost
W:And cursed the hungry mind of man
W:That feeds the future at such cost
W:My head was bowed, my eyes were closed
W:When in my ears their voices rang
W:And these few words lodged deep inside
W:And in my very soul they sang
W:
W:We never went away
W:You always knew that we were near
W:Remember how to look for us
W:You'll see we were always here
W:
W:I raised my eyes to seek them out
W:The world was empty all around
W:The rain came tumbling from the sky
W:It drowned all dreams upon the ground
W:And when they asked me why I wept
W:Like one who for his dead love mourns
W:The only answer I could give
W:I dreamed that there were unicorns
W:
W:We never went away
W:You always knew that we were near
W:Remember how to look for us
W:You'll see we were always here
