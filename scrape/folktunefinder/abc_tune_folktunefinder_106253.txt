% This rare jig tune which has haunted my memory for years was
% evidently derived from "The Old Woman Lamenting Her Purse",
% No. 560, O'Neill's Music of Ireland 1903. The air does not appear
% in the Bunting Collections. A setting in which the first part is
% repeated after the second part is printed without note or comment
% in Petrie's Complete Collection of Irish Music.
