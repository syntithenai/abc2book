W:  Chorus:
W:  And drill, ye tarriers, drill
W:  Drill, ye tarriers, drill
W:  For it's work all day for the sugar in you tay

W:  And blast, and fire

W:She baked good bread and she baked it well

W:Jim Goff a dollar short was found
W:When he asked, "What for" came this reply
W:"You were docked for the time you were up in the sky"
