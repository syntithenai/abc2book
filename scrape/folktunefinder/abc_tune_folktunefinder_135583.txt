B: Bob's Note Book 9 #119
N: Last week Dave Millstone called a dance in Woodstock, NY, and  he  got  Janie
N: Orzechowski  and  Sarah  Bauhan  and I to play the music.  We had a real nice
N: evening. I saw a familiar face, belonging to an old friend with deep roots in
N: Dublin,  NH,  where  I  used to live; it was Elise Cabot, and I had the great
N: pleasure of dancing a waltz with her.  Someday perhaps you will dance to this
N: waltz, Elise - I surely hope so.  Much love to you, from Bob.
R: waltz
