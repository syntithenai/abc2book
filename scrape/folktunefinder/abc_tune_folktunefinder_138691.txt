%
% The above fine marching tune tho' manifestly in the
% Irish style is probably of Scotch origin because it comes
% from the subconscious memory of the writer who
% associated in Chicago nearly 50 years ago, with such
% noted Highland pipers as McLean, Cant, and Monroe.
% Of the four distinct tunes, named after Lochiel the
% Jacobite hero to be found in old printed collections
% I find that one specially arranged for the Highland
% bagpipe is a variant of "Johnny's Trip to France";
% dreamily remembered by the editor since early manhood.
