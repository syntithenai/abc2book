W:'Twas on a summer's morning, along as I did pass
W:On the banks of Inverary I met a com-e-ly lass.
W:Her hair hung over her shoulders, her eyes like stars did shine,
W:On the banks of Inverary I wish'd her heart was mine.
W:
W:I did embrace this fair maid as fast as e'er I could,
W:Her hair hung over her shoulders most like to threads of gold;
W:Her hair hung over her shoulders, her tears like drops of dew -
W:"On the banks of Inverary I'm glad to meet with you."
W:
W:"Leave off, my handsome young man, do not embrace me so,
W:For after so much kissing there comes a dreadful woe,
W:And if my poor heart should be ensnared and I beguil'd by thee,
W:On the banks of Inverary I shall walk alone," said she.
W:
W:I said,  "My handsome fair maid, the truth to you I'll tell,
W:On the banks of Inverary twelve maidens I've beguil'd;
W:But I will not begin to-night, my charmer," then said he,
W:"On the banks of Inverary I've found my wife. " said he.
W:
W:So he set this handsome fair maid on horseback very high,
W:"Unto some parson we will go and there the knot will tie,
W:And then we will sing songs of love until the day we die;
W:On the banks of Inverary where no-one there is nigh."
