W:2. I have moved and I've kept on moving,
W:   proved the points that I needed proving,
W:   lost the friends I needed losing,
W:   found others on the way.
W:   I have tried and I've kept on trying,
W:   stolen dreams, yes, there's no denying,
W:   I've travelled far, sometimes with conscience flying
W:   somewhere with the wind.
W:3. Well, now I'm sitting here before the fire,
W:   the empty room, the forest choir,
W:   the flames that couldn't get any higher,
W:   they've withered now, they've gone.
W:   But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear
W:   and I know what I will do tomorrow
W:   When the hands have shaken and the kisses flowed
W:   well, I will disappear.
