W:  Stormy old weather
W:  When the wind blows

W:He sang out, "Oh skipper, you cannot catch me"
W:
W:Up jumped the mackerel with spots on his back
W:He sang out, "Oh skipper, Come square your maintack"
W:
W:Up jumped the cod with his great bulging eye
W:He sang out, "Oh skipper, your rig is too high"
W:
W:Up jumped the sunfish, the smallest of all
W:He sang out, "Oh skipper, come haul your trawl, haul"
W:
W:Up jumped the crab with his great long claw
W:He sang out, "Oh skipper, you'll run her ashore"
W:
