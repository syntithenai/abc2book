T: Oh Lord It's Hard to be Humble
R: waltz
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble, When you're perfect in every way
W: I can't wait to look in the mirror, Cuz I get better lookin each day
W: To know me is to love me, I must be a hell of a man
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble, But I'm doin' the best that I can
W:
W: I used to have a girlfriend, But I guess she just couldn't compete
W: With all these love starved women, Who keep clamoring at my feet
W: Well I probably could find me another, But I guess they're all in awe of me
W: Who cares I never get lonesome, Cuz I treasure my own company
W:
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble, When you're perfect in every way
W: I can't wait to look in the mirror, Cuz I get better lookin each day
W: To know me is to love me, I must be a hell of a man
W: Oh Lord it's hard to be humble, But I'm doin the best that I can
W:
W: I guess you could say I am a loner, A cowboy all locked up and proud
W: Well I could have lots of friends if I wanted, But then I wouldn't stand out in a crowd
W: Some folks say that I'm egotistical, Hell I don't even know what that means
W: I guess it has something to do with the way, That I fill out my skin tight blue jeans
