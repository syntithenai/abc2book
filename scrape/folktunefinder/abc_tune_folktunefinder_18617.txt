W: Oh Bridgit O'Malley, you left my heart shaken
W: With a hopeless desolation, I'd have you to know
W: It's the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken
W: And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go.
W:
W: The white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree
W: Are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she
W: I gaze upon the cold moon till the stars drown in the warm sea
W: And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me.
W:
W: My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now
W: My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone
W: All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now
W: For another has taken my love for his own.
W:
W: The day it is approaching when we were to be married
W: And it's rather I would die than live only to grieve
W: Oh meet me, my Darling, e'er the sun sets o'er the barley
W: And I'll meet you there on the road to Drumslieve.
W:
W: Oh Bridgit O'Malley, you've left my heart shaken
W: With a hopeless desolation, I'd have you to know
W: It's the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken
W: And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go.
