N:Here's what Simpson says about Princess Royal in The British Broadside ballads and their Music:
N:This air, entitled 'Iantha' is included among  "Th Tunes of the French Dances", a supplement
N:to the third edition of 'The Dancing master', c.1662, N. 28. It is not in the 1669 supplement
N:but is found twice in 'Apollo's Banquet', 1670, No. 176, 'Ianythae' and No.200 "La Princess
N:Royale" and continues under the latter title in subsequent editions of that work
