W:As I walked over London bridge
W:Oh so early in the morning,
W:If was there I met a pretty fair maid
W:All lamenting for her Geordie.
W:
W:What has he done Who has he killed
W:Has he murdered anybody"
W:"No, he stole five pearls from the royal king
W:And he sold them in a hurry."
W:
W:"Go bring to me my riding steed,
W:Go saddle up my pony.
W:Five hundred pounds I will lay down
W:All to plead for the life of Geordie."
W:
W:"We will have him hung with a golden chain:
W:Such a chain there is not many.
W:We will have him buried with the same
W:For the likes and the life of Geordie."
W:
W:The judge looked over his right shoulder_
W:It was words he didn't say many:
W:"Prepare yourself for death, young man,
W:For it's mercy you shan't have any."
W:
W:The judge looked over his left shoulder;
W:it was words he didn't say many:
W:"I'm afeared you came too late, fair maid,
W:For your loved one is judged already."
W:
W:"If I had my Geordie on yonders plain
W:It's kisses I'd have many.
W:With a sword and pistol by my side
W:I'll die for the life of Geordie."
