S:From "A Breeze Through the CONduit"
B:A Breeze Through the CONduit, (c) 1992 by Julia West
N:This is a woman's viewpoint of war--the side not seen in the bards'
N:songs of the glories of battle.
N:Owain Glyn Dwr (Glendower) was the
N:Welsh Prince who, in the closing years of the fourteenth century, took
N:most of Wales back from the English.  Unfortunately for the Welsh
N:people, the tide soon turned and by 1415 Glyn Dwr was in hiding and the
N:English had taken back their former territories.
D:On "A Breeze Through the CONduit" tape
W:'Tis now, in the warm tender green time of spring
W:I think of my brother, the songs he did sing.
W:With crwth or with harp by some cold mountain stream
W:Amidst the pale flowers with his music he'd dream.
W:He'd sing of his love for the good things he knew--
W:Fair women, good mead, and companions so true.
W:Chorus:
W:He went off to fight in the late snows of spring
W:For Glyn Dwr, our Prince, 'gainst the troops of the King.
W:With a song on his lips he did fight--and was killed.
W:And the music within him forever was stilled.
