W:On the sccond of August, eighteen hundred and one,
W:As we sailed with Lord Nelson to the port of Boulogne
W:For to cut out some shipping, which proved in vain:
W:To our misfortune they were all moored with chain.
W:
W:Our boats being well-manned by eleven at night
W:To cut out their shipping, not expecbng to fight;
W:But the grape from their batteries so smartly did play
W:That nine hundred brave seamen killed and wounded there lay.
W:
W:We hoisted our colors, and so bold did them spread,
W:With the British flag flying at the royal mast head;
W:For the honour of old England we'll always maintain
W:While bold British seamen plough the watery main.
W:
W:Exposed to the fire of the enemy we lay
W:While ninety bright pieces of cannon did play;
W:There many brave seamen did lay in their gore,
W:And the shots from the batteries most smartly did pour.
W:
W:Our noble commander with his heart full of grief
W:Used every endeavour to afford us relief.
W:No ship could assist us as well he did know;
W:In this wounded condition we were tossed to and fro.
W:
W:All you  who relieve us the Lord will you bless
W:For relieving poor seamen in times of distress.
W:May the Lord put an end to all cruel wars,
W:Send peace and contentment to all British tars.
