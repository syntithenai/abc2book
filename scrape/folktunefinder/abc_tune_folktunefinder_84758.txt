W:When Daphne from fair Phoebus did fly
W:The west wind most sweetly did blow in her face
W:Her silken scarf scarce shadowed her eyes
W:The God cried, O pity! and held her in chace
W:Stay, Nymph, stay, Nymph, cries Apollo, tarry and turn thee, Sweet Nymph, stay
W:Lion nor Tiger doth thee follow, turn thy fair eyes, and look this way
W:O turn, O pretty sweet, and let our red lips meet
W:O pity me, Daphne, pity me,
W:&c.
