N:From this county came some of the greatest
N:fiddlers in the tradition: Coleman, Morrison, Scanlon, O'Beirne, and
N:others before them. It is their Sligo, the Sligo of Ballymote, Gurteen,
N:and Collooney. And it is also the Sligo of Ben Bulben, that most famous
N:hill immortalized in the verses of Ireland's Nobel Prize winning poet
N:William Butler Yeats.
