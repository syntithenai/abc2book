A:Leeds
N:Mr. Spencer was obviously having serious  problems with his pen, as
N:many of the noteheads  are large blots.  1 - This bar has five beats,
N:there are two  low crochets D's  2 - this note is given as low D in the
N:MS - and the bar is then
N: repeated identically, (giving 9 bars in the A music). -  so one bar
N:has been omitted.  There are several other changes that could be made -
N: eg. first two notes would usually be DC rather than GF - but where do
N:you stop'GS' written on the stave st the end.
