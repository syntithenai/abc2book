N:I'm sure he had many a cross
N:to bear, but this title really
N:commemorates the crossroads located
N:near the old country doctor's
N:place outside Cootehill.
N:Ed tried to find these crossroads
N:during his '69 visit, but to
N:no avail. The road had been changed
N:some years back, and the doctor
N:had long since gone from the old
N:place that Ed knew as a child.
