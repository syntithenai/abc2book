N:"Old Pat Kane" was a Wexford
N:man who worked on a rich man's
N:estate in the Philadelphia suburbs.
N:Ed visited Pat and his wife
N:in the early seventies, a year
N:or so after his visit to Ireland.
N:Pat worked the farm much as he did
N:in the Old Country and he had
N:great flavor in his language. He
N:liked his bottle of "Porther,"
N:whenever he could get it. He
N:often exclaimed that man needed
N:nothing else to sustain himself
N:in this life. "It is more
N:than a drink," he was heard to
N:say-"it's both meat and dhrink."
