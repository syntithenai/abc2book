N:The sad gaiety of this tune celebrates the longing of the exile for his native
N:home. No one quite understands the irony of a happy farewell as well as the poet
N:in Frank O'Connor's translation from the Irish:
N:What happier fortune can one find,
N:Than with the girl who pleases one's mind;
N:To leave one's home and friends behind
N:And sail on the first favoring wind.
