T:Sta(i)nes Morris
H:First printed in the "William Ballet Lute Book" (1595). It is not known
H:that the town of Staines, on the Thames, had any connection with this tune.
N:Morris-dance tune.
N:There is much disagreement over which e's should be flat or natural. Older
N:books all show Eb throughout, but this could just be an result of using "proper"
N:classical notation. Current practice seems to be to play it mostly in Dorian
N:mode.

N:Playford
N:Raven (in Em)
