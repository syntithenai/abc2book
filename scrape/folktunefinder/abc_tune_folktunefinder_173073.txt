N:I wrote this 3-part hornpipe after getting lost in a maze made 
N:of maize.The maze was near Cognac and was designed on an 
N:idea inspired by Antoine de St.Exupery's book entitled 'The 
N:Little Prince'. Anyway, being the contrary person I am, I 
N:decided to do away with the thoughtfully provided map and 
N:promptly lost all sense of direction -for several hours I 
N:believe.
