%
% in former times it was much more common to find a white stripe
% along the spine of brown or black cows, and this coloration was
% called "Druim-fionn", or white-black. which became "Drimmin" or
% "Drimen". Thus we have "Drimmin-fionn-dubh" or White-back
% black cow, etc. In poetical literature those titles are allegorical.
% "Drimmin Dhu" was a political password among the Irish Jacobites,
% and all "Drimmin" songs breathe a spirit of fealty to the Jacobite
% cause.
