L:1/8
Q:2/4=100
W:I wanted wings 'til I got the God damn things
W:Now l don't want them any more
W:They taught me how to fly, then they sent me here to die
W:I've got a belly full of war.
W:You can save those Zeros for the other God damn heroes
W:For distinguished flying crosses do not compensate for losses.

W:  Chorus:
W:  I wanted wings 'til I got the God damn things
W:  Now I don't want them any more.
W:
W:I'll take the dames while the rest go down in flames
W:I've no desire to be burned;
W:Air combat's no romance and it made me wet my pants
W:I'm not a fighter, I have learned.
W:You can leave the Mitsubishes for the crazy sons-a-bitches
W:'Cause I'd rather lay a woman than be picked up by a Grumman.
W:
W:I'm too young to die in a Goddamn PBY
W:That's for the eager, not for me.
W:l won't trust to luck to be picked up in a "Duck"
W:After I've crashed into the sea
W:I would rather be a bellhop than a flier on a flattop
W:With my hand around a bottle not a God damn throttle.
W:
W:I don't want to tour over Berlin or the Ruhr
W:Ack Ack always makes me lose my lunch;
W:For me there's no Hey Hey when they holler "Bombs Away''
W:I'd rather be at home with the bunch.
W:For there's one thing you can't laugh off
W:And that's when they shoot your ass off
W:And I'd rather be home, Buster, with my ass than with a cluster,
W:
W:They feed us lousy chow. but we stay alive somehow
W:On dehydrated eggs and milk and stew
W:The rumor has it next they'll be dehydrating sex
W:And that's the day I'll tell the coach I'm through.
W:For I've managed all the dangers, the shooting back of strangers
W:But when l get home late l want my woman straight, Buster.
