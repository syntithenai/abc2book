N:"The title "Redican's Mother" comes from Jack and Charlie Coen's LP "The
N:Branch Line." The notes state: "Jack  got [the tune] from Larry Redican who
N:had originally learned it from his mother. Jack met Larry's mother once in
N:Dublin in 1960. She was 104 years old at the time and played the tin whistle
N:up to the day she died." You see why Jack might have wanted to call the tune
N:after her. It wasn't composed by Larry Redican though. The tune is called
N:"Trealock Lauder" in O'Farrell's Pocket Companion (c.1800) and "The Barony
N:Jig" in the Roche Collection".
