W:I am a roving hackler lad that loves the shamrock shore,
W:My name is Pat McDonnell and my age is eighty-four;
W:Belov'd and well-respected by my neighbors one and all
W:On St. Patrick's day I loved to stray round Lavey and Grouse Hall.
W:
W:When I was young I danced and sung and drank good whiskey, too.
W:Each shebeen shop that sold a drop of the real old mountain dew.
W:With the potheen still on every hill the peelers had no call
W:Round sweet Stradone I am well known, round Lavey and Grouse Hall.
W:
W:I rambled round from town to town for hackling was my trade,
W:None can deny I think that I an honest living made;
W:Where e'er I'd stay by night or day the youth wud always call
W:To have some crack with Paddy Jack, the hackler from Grouse Hall.
W:
W:I think it strange how times have changed so very much of late,
W:Coercion now is all the row and Peelers on their bate.
W:To take a glass is now, alas, the greatest crime of all
W:Since Balfour placed that hungry beast the Sergeant of Grouse Hall.
W:
W:The busy tool of Castle rule he travels night and day,
W:He'll seize a goat just by the throat for want of better prey;
W:The nasty skunk, he'll swear you're drunk tho' you took none at all
W:There is no peace about the place since he came to Grouse Hall.
W:
W:'Twas on pretense of this offense he dragged me off to jail,
W:Alone to dwell in a cold cell my fate for to bewail.
W:My hoary head on a plank bed, such wrongs for vengeance call
W:He'll rue the day he dragged away the hackler from Grouse Hall.
W:
W:He haunts the League just like a plague, and shame for to relate
W:The priest can't be on Sunday free the Mass to celebrate.
W:It's there he'll kneel encased in steel prepared on duty's call
W:For to assail and drag to jail our clergy from Grouse Hall.
W:
W:Down into hell he'd run pell-mell to hunt for potheen there
W:And won't be loath to swear an oath 'twas found in Killinkere.
W:He'll search your bed from foot to head, sheets, blankets, tick and all
W:Your wife, undressed, must leave the nest for Jemmy of Grouse Hall.
W:
W:He fixed a plan for one poor man who had a handsome wife
W:To take away without delay her liberty and life.
W:He'd swear quite plain that he's insane and got no sense at all,
W:As he has done of late with one convenient to Grouse Hall.
W:
W:Thank God the day's not far away when Home Rule will be seen,
W:And brave Parnell at home will dwell and shine in College Green;
W:Our policemen will all be then our nation's choice and all,
W:Old Balfour's pack will get the sack and banished from Grouse Hall.
W:
W:Let old and young clear out their lungs and sing this little song,
W:Come join with me and let him see you all resent the wrong.
W:And while I live I'll always give a prayer for his downfall
W:And when I die I don't deny I'll haunt him from Grouse hall.
