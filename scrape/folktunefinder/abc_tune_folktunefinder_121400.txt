% In the year 1902 a thin oblong book of manuscript music came to
% hand from Prof. P.D. Reidy "Professor of Dancing, London and
% Castleisland". Altho it included forty tunes from the repertory of
% five competent fiddlers, nearly all were variants of tunes already
% in our possession. The above as played by Daniel J. Kelleher
% is one of the exceptions. There can be little doubt that Mr.
% Reidy's title was well deserved, because his fame as a dancer
% and dancing master in early life in North Kerry was successfully
% maintained later in life in London, where he was esteemed as
% an authority on the subject. Frequent mention of his name
% appears in "Irish Minstrels and Musicians".
