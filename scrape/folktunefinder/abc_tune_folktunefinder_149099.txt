W:Come by the hills to the land where fancy is free
W:And stand where the peaks meet the sky and the lochs meet the sea
W:Where the rivers run clear and the bracken is gold in the sun
W:Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this day  is  done
W:
W:Oh, come by the hills to the land where life is a song
W:And sing while the birds fill the air with their joy all day long
W:Where the trees sway in time and even the wind sings in tune
W:Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this  day  is  done
W:
W:Come by the hills to the land where legend re-mains
W:Where stories of old fill the heart and may yet come a-gain
W:Where our past has been lost and the future has still to be won
W:Ah, the cares of to-morrow can wait 'til this  day  is  done
