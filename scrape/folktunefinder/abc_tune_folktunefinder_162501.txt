W:Alas, my love, you do me wrong,
W:To cast me off discourteously.
W:For I have loved you well and long,
W:Delighting in your company.
W:Greensleeves was all my joy
W:Greensleeves was my delight,
W:Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
W:And who but my lady greensleeves.
W:
W:Your vows you've broken, like my heart,
W:Oh, why did you so enrapture me
W:Now I remain in a world apart
W:But my heart remains in captivity. (Chorus)
W:
W:I have been ready at your hand,
W:To grant whatever you would crave,
W:I have both wagered life and land,
W:Your love and good-will for to have. (Chorus)
W:
W:If you intend thus to disdain,
W:It does the more enrapture me,
W:And even so, I still remain
W:A lover in captivity. (Chorus)
W:
W:My men were clothed all in green,
W:And they did ever wait on thee;
W:All this was gallant to be seen,
W:And yet thou wouldst not love me. (Chorus)
W:
W:Thou couldst desire no earthly thing,
W:but still thou hadst it readily.
W:Thy music still to play and sing;
W:And yet thou wouldst not love me. (Chorus)
W:
W:Well, I will pray to God on high,
W:that thou my constancy mayst see,
W:And that yet once before I die,
W:Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me. (Chorus)
W:
W:Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
W:To God I pray to prosper thee,
W:For I am still thy lover true,
W:Come once again and love me. (Chorus)
