Q:400
N:We took our agent with us on a little tour around Scotland 
N:once, and on a day off near my home ground we teasingly
N:dragged him up Dollar Glen to see the spectacular Castle 
N:Campbell. Not being a very fit chap he found all this a bit of 
N:a struggle and was not at all pleased on arrival at the top to 
N:discover the existence of a road we could have driven up. 
N:This tune is on the Spyka album.
