N:A New Selection of the most Admired Original Irish Airs,
N:Hime:Dublin, n.d. (c 1800). one of 22 tunes.
N:Copy at Lib. of Congress
H:From a Scots MS of the 1740's. Rebinding narrowed margins and
H:obscured some text. There are broadside copies extant, but I
H:haven't seen one. A shorter copy of the song is in the later
H:Scots Mansfield/ St. Clair MS. The similar American song
H:"Nottamun/Nottingham town" is probably to some extent derived
H:from this.]

W:Dear Catholick sister thou son of great M[ars
W:I've been at the fighting where there was no w[ars
W:no guns or no swords, but a great deal of arm[s
W:to kill our poor friends that wou'd do us no ha[rms
W:I set out for Dublin, next michael mass pas[t
W:and Gallop't to Chester in a Damnable has[te
W:but the seas blow'd a storm, & the winds they di[--
W:which cast me away on the shore by my sho[--
W:I having no haste did ride post to the mar[--
W:Dear sister pray hear my poor sorrowful [--
W:My] horse standing still, She threw me in the dirt |f.187.
W:I] doubed all my flesh & sore bruised my shirt
W:I] being of Courage I mounted again
W:And] on my ten toes I tript over the main
W:The]re taking a nap for six days on the ground
W:In th]ree I arrived in fair London Town
W:And] when I came there not a shoul cou'd I see
W:The] Crowd was so thick they stood staring at me
W:Not] one word did thee speak but made damnable pime  [pain
W:--] my feet were worn out & my Brogues grown so thin
W:Then] nevertheles standing still I did go
W:--]e for hide peark & enquire for the shew          [Hyde Park
W:By] my shoul Cry'd the people but nothing did say
W:The] army is here tho the Camp's march'd away
W:To f]ind out new pleasures I was at a loss
W:So] shuting my eyes, I perceiv'd Charing Cross
W:The]re a man sat on horse back upon a cold stone
W:Wi]th thousands about him good fait all alone
W:--]ult'd off my head to his majesties Graces
W:I ask'd him the way to, I do not know what pl[aces |f. 187v
W:but he was so Brazen, he wou'd not come do[wn
W:Nor shew me the way for an Irish half Cro[wn
W:So by my own self I went stumbling on
W:Quite tired to death, with the Damnable C[]h[--
W:at last to hide Park good fait I die Con[--
W:by the beat of a Trumpet & Sound of a Dru[m
W:Heat[] soldiers on horseback stood here & lay cher[e-
W:With their left wing in the front & their right in the [rear
W:and horse men on foot in an open Defence
W:broke open open [sic] their files with a brave allie[nce
W:Then by my fait they began to retire
W:when the Conel cry'd march, present they gave [fire
W:Without powder or Ball such a noise the[y] did mak[e
W:as made the earth tremble & Clouds for to quake
W:The noise being over, tho' none did I hear
W:I went to the Baker to Buy me some Bee[r
W:and having no trust I payd Chink for my Ch[--
W:I took Hakney Coach & away I did walk
W:Then down to the Thames I made my appro[ach
W:I] took me a place in the flying stage coach
W:So] long we did Roll on the watery main
W:At la]st we arrived at Salisbury plain
W:I']s quite Choak'd with dust tho' it rained all the day
W:I ho]ld for a pint to drive Gladness away
W:But] ever I cou'd drink it, I heard a great noise
W:'Twas] nothing at all but Hallo my boys
W:The] King and the Prince & a great many more
W:All] coming behind us just going before
W:And] all keeping silence the[y] loudly did sing
W:They] kept on their hats for to honour the King
W:Be]ing Contented to sit on my seat
W:I'm] still and went out to the midst of the street
W:The]re the Bishop of Salisbury he did rehearse
W:A p]iece of good Latine in old English verse
W:It] pleased his majestys grace to protest
W:Bu]t it was a fine Altho meanly dres'd
W:The]n out came the Clergy in a black scarlet Gown
W:To] kiss the King's hand for the sake of the Crown
W:But all the while that the Condects[] did run       |f. 188v
W:There was good rost beef & Backon & best o[f rum 
W:There was Baskets of Claret & white wine was [---

W:I took such a surfeit now at this fine fe[ast
W:as did not disturb my poor shoul in the le[ast
W:but if ever I go to see London again
