W:He's lichted at Brackley yetts at the day dawin';
W:Says: "Baron o'Brackley, it's are ye within,
W:There's sharp swords at your yetts'll gar your bluid spin."
W:
W:Oot spak the brave baron ower the castle wa',
W:"Are ye come to spulyie and plunder my ha'
W:But gin ye be a gentleman, licht and come in;
W:Gin ye drink o'my wine ye'll no'gar my bluid spin."
W:
W:His lady rose up, to the window she went,
W:She heard her kye lowin' o'er hill and o'er bent;
W:"O, rise up, bold Brackley and turn back your kye,
W:For the lads o'Drumwharren are drivin'them by."
W:
W:"How can I rise, lady, or turn them again
W:For where I hae ae man I wat they hae ten."
W:She's ca'd on her Maries to come ta her hand,
W:Says: "Bring your rocks, lasses, we will them command.
W:
W:Gin I had a husband as I wat I hae nane,
W:He'd no' lie in his bed and see his kye ta'en".
W:"Now haud your tongue, Peggy, and gie me my gun,
W:Ye'll see me gang oot but I'll never come in.
W:
W:Arise, Peggy Gordon and gie me my gun,
W:I will gang oot though I never come in.
W:Then kiss me, my Peggy, I'll nae langer stay,
W:For I will gang oot and meet Inverey."
W:
W:When Brackley was ready and stood in the close,
W:A bonnier gallant ne'er mounted a horse.
W:"What'll come o'your lady and bonny young son
W:O, what'll come o' them when Brackley is gone"
W:
W:"Strike, dogs" cries Inverey, "fecht till you're slain,
W:For we are four hunder and ye are four men.
W:Strike, you proud boaster, your honour is gone
W:Your lands we will plunder, your castel we'll burn."
W:
W:At the head o' the Etnach the battle began,
W:At little Aucholzie they killed the first man.
W:At first they killed ae man and syne they killed twa,
W:Then the Baron o'Brackley, the flooer o' them a'.
W:
W:They killed William Gordon and James o' the Knock,
W:And brave Alexander, the flooer o' Glenmuick.
W:Whit sighin' and moanin' was heard in the glen,
W:For the Baron o' Brackley wha basely was slaln.
W:
W:Cam' ye by Brackley yetts, cam' ye by there
W:And saw ye his Peggy, a-tearin' her hair
W:O, I was by Brackley yetts, I cam' by there
W:And I saw Peggy Gordon a-braidin' her hair.
W:
W:She was rantin' and dancing and singin' for joy,
W:She swore that ere nicht she would feast Inverney;
W:She ate wi' him, drank wi' him, welcomed him in
W:Was kin to the man wha had slain her baron.
W:
W:O, fye on ye lady, how could ye dae sae
W:Ye opened the yetts tae the fause Inverney.
W:There's dule in the kitchen and mirth in the ha'
W:That the Baron o' Brackley is deid and awa'.
