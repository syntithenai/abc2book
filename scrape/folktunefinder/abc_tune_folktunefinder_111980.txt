H:Gordon Clark, of  St. Stephens NB is one of the lighthouse keepers I work with. Good at spinning the tales from his life experiences, during his youth there were lots of characters in and about his hometown. Johnny Oscar was a simple friendly soul who would answer to any of his given names... though if you asked him his name, without hesitation hed spit out his entire handle... Johnny Oscar Henry Libbey Watt. Less than five  feet tall, his long arms and size eleven feet made him a sight you wouldn't forget. He came from the country near Watt Junction, NB. Saturday nights in the '30s and '40s he'd take the train into town. On arrival, first thing he'd buy a big cigar. The rest of his evening would be spent taking his dignified walk, savouring the cigar and greeting the residents of St. Stephens and Calais.\.i
