N:The Blessings of Silver. Written
N:for Lou and Mary Quinn's
N:twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.
N:Ed loved the connotations of
N:the title: the blessings of twenty-five
N:years of marriage, the blessings of a
N:couple growing old together, and the many rewards
N:of family life. Ed admired Lou not
N:only because of his musical talent, but also because he
N:was a self-made man who set high standards
N:for other immigrants who followed him to the New World.
K:Bb
