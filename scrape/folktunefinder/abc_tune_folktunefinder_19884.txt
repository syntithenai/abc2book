W:Drink to me only with thine eyes,
W:And I will pledge with mine;
W:Or leave a kiss within the cup,
W:And I'll not ask for wine.
W:The thirst that from the soul doth rise,
W:Doth crave a drink divine;
W:But might I of Jove's nectar sup,
W:I would not change for thine.
W:
W:I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
W:Not so much honoring thee
W:As giving it a hope that there
W:It could not withered be;
W:But thou there on did't only breathe
W:And sent'st back to me,
W:Since when it grows and smells, I swear,
W:Not of itself, but thee.
