W: dove beneath my floating home
W: Down below my graceful side, In the turning tide
W: To watch the sea fish roam
W:

W: from the sailors of the Sandra Marie
W: There's another island a days' run away from here
W: And it’s empty and free
W: 
W: From here to Venezuela
W: nothing more than to see
W: Than a hundred thousand islands, flung like jewels upon the sea
W: For you and me

W: Women are calling at me to end the tales
W: But perhaps I'll see you the next quiet place
W: I furl my sails

W: Got out of town on a boat, going to Southern islands
W: Sailing a reach before a following sea
W: She was making for the trades on the outside
W: And the downhill run to Papeete
W: Off the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas
W: We got eighty feet of the waterline
W: Nicely making way
W: In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you
W: But on a midnight watch I realized
W: Why twice you ran away
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: (I think about)
W: Think about how many times I have fallen
W: Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
W: What heaven brought you and me
W: Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I have been around the world (Looking)
W: Looking for that woman-girl
W: (And I know she knows)
W: Who knows love can endure
W: And you know it will
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
W: You understand now why you came this way
W: 'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small
W: But it's as big as the promise
W: The promise of a coming day
W: So I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying
W: And my love is an anchor tied to you
W: Tied with a silver chain
W: I have my ship
W: And all her flags are a-flying
W: She is all that I have left
W: And music is her name
W: 
W: [Pre-Chorus]
W: (I think about)
W: Think about how many times I have fallen
W: Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
W: What heaven brought you and me
W: Cannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)
W: 
W: [Chorus]
W: I have been around the world (Looking)
W: Looking for that woman-girl
W: Who knows love can endure
W: And you know it will
W: And you know it will
W: (Yes)
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: So we cheated and we lied and we tested
W: And we never failed to fail
W: It was the easiest thing to do
W: You will survive being bested
W: Somebody fine
W: Will come along, make me forget about loving you
W: In the Southern Cross

W: [Verse 1]

W: Like yours, m'lady, like yours

W: In the morning after it rained
W: Peacocks wandered aimlessly
W: Underneath an orange tree
W: Why can't she see me?

W: [Verse 2]
W: Guinnevere drew pentagrams
W: Like yours, m'lady, like yours
W: Late at night when she thought

W: [Bridge]
W: As she turns her gaze
W: Down the slope to the harbor where I lay
W: Anchored for a day
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Guinnevere had golden hair
W: Like yours, m'lady, like yours
W: Streaming out when we'd ride

W: Yesterday
W: Seagulls circle endlessly
W: I sing in silent harmony
W: We shall be free

W: Before they can die (That we can live in)

W:  A new day, a new way and new eyes to see the dawn
W: Go your way, I'll go mine and carry on
W:  
W: The sky is clearing and the night has cried enough

W: Will you bring me happiness? will you bring me sorrow?
W: Oh, the questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
W: Lover can you talk to me?
W:   
W: [Verse 2]
W: (same as verse 1)
W:  
W: Girl when I was on my own, chasing you down
W: What was it made you run? trying your best just to get around.
W: The questions of a thousand dreams, what you do and what you see
W: Lover can you talk to me?

W: [Verse 1]
W: Six o'clock...    in the morning, I feel pretty good,
W:       So I dropped in - to the luxury of The Lords...
W:   ...Fighting dragons, and crossing swords...   with the people,
W: A - gainst the hordes who came to conquer!      |  /  /   /  / |
W:  
W: [Verse 2]
W: Seven o'clock       ...in the morning,
W: Here it comes,  I taste the warning,
W: And I am so amazed I'm here today,
W: Seeing things so clear this way,
W:     In the car, and on my way to Stonehenge!     |  /  /  /  /  |

W: [Verse 3]
W:      I'm flying in Win - chester Cath - edral,
W:      Sunlight pouring through the break of day,
W:     Stumbled through the door, and into the cham-------ber!
W:  
W: [Verse 4]
W: There's a lady setting flowers on a table covered lace,
W: And a cleaner in the distance finds a cobweb on a face,
W: And a feeling, deep inside of me,
W: Tells me this can't be... the place!        |  /  /  /  /  |
W:  
W: [Verse 5]
W:      I'm flying in Win - chester Cath - edral,
W:      All re - ligion has to have it's day--------,
W:     Ex - pressions on the face of the sav------iour,
W: Made me say-----,        'I can't stay----!'
W:  
W: [Verse 6]
W: Open up the gates of the church, and let me out of here,
W: Too many people have lied in the name of Christ,
W: For anyone to heed the call,
W: So many people have died in the name of Christ, 
W: That I can't believe it all!
W:  
W: [Verse 7]
W: Now I'm standing on the grave of a soldier that died in 1799,
W: And the day he died it was a birthday,
W: And I noticed it was mine,
W: And my head didn't know just who I was,
W: And I went spinning back in time!
W:  
W: [Verse 8]
W: And I am high upon the alter, high----  upon the alter,

W:      It's hard enough to drink the wine,
W:      The air inside just hangs in delusion,
W: But given time-----,       I'll be fine----!
W:  
W: [Verse 10]
W: Open up the gates of the church, and let me out of here,
W: Too many people have lied in the name of Christ,

W: Forgive me if my fantasies might seem a little shopworn
W: I'm sure you've heard it all before  I wonder what's the right form
W: Love songs written for you  it's been going down for years
W: But to sing what's in my heart seems more honest than the tears
W:  
W: [pre-chorus]
W: I am curious,  Don't want to hurry us,
W: I'm intrigued with us,   Ain't this song a bust
W: I don't care,   Dark star
W:  
W: [verse 2]
W: I met you several years ago
W: The times they were so strange but I had a feeling
W: You looked into my eyes just once
W: An instant flashing by that we were stealing
W: Another time you felt so bad
W: And I wasn't any help at all as I recall
W: We didn't know quite what to do
W: So we left the wanting be still there for me and you
W:  
W: [chorus]

W: [Verse 1]
W: Four and twenty years ago I come into this life
W: The son of a woman and a man who lived in strife
W: He was tired of being poor
W: And he wasn't into selling door to door
W: And he worked like the devil to be more
W: 
W: [Verse 2]
W: A different kind of poverty now upsets me so
W: Night after sleepless night, I walk the floor and I want to know
W: Why am I so alone?
W: Where is my woman, can I bring her home?
W: Have I driven her away? Is she gone?
W: 
W: [Verse 3]
W: Morning comes the sunrise and I'm driven to my bed
W: I see that it is empty and there's devils in my head
W: I embrace the many colored beast
W: I grow weary of the torment, can there be no peace?
W: And I find myself just wishing that my life would simply cease

W: In a land that's known as freedom
W: how can such a thing be fair?
W: Won't you please come to Chicago for the help that we can bring?

W: Won't you please come to Chicago... for a ride?
W: Don't ask Jack to help you
W: 'cause he'll turn the other ear.
W: Won't you please come to Chicago or else join the other side?
W:   
W: [Chorus]
W: We can change... the world,

W: Let a man live his own life (It's dying)
W: Rules and regulations, who needs them?
W: Throw 'em out the door...

W: Midnight, that old clock keeps ticking.
W: The kids are all asleep,  and I'm walking the floor.
W: Darlin', I can see that you're dreaming.
W: And I don't wanna wake you up,  when I close the door.
W:  
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.
W: And a businessman don't know what that means.
W: There's a garden outside she works in every day.
W: And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's,
W: gonna come and take it all away.
W:  
W: [Verse 2]
W: Lately, I've been thinking 'bout daddy.
W: And how he always made things work,  when the chips were down.
W: And I know, I've got something inside me.
W: There's always a light there to guide me,  to what can't be found.
W:  
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.
W: And a businessman don't know what that means.
W: There's a swing outside the kids play on every day.
W: And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's,
W: gonna come and take it all away.
W:  
W: [Bridge]
W:   Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
W: Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
W:  
W: [Solo]
W:  
W: [Verse 3]
W: Remember, how we first came here together.
W: Standing on an empty lot,  holding hands.
W: Later, we came back in the moonlight.
W: And made love right where the kitchen is,  then we made our plans.
W:  
W: [Chorus]
W: This old house of ours is built on dreams.
W: And a businessman don't know what that means.
W: There's a garden outside she works in every day.
W: And tomorrow morning a man from the bank's,
W: gonna come and take it all away.
W:  
W: [Outro]
W:   Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.
W: Take it all away, take it all away, take it all away.

W: Have you seen Panama
W: Where I first fell in love
W: It will forever be an emerald necklace
W: Set between the seas
W: 
W: Beside a crystal stream
W: In the mountains of Chiriqui
W: I saw a girl astride a horse she waved at me
W: I was fifteen
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land
W: Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama?
W: 
W: Went riding off alone
W: Much further than I should have gone
W: I wandered deep into the dark
W: Now which way gets me home
W: 
W: Then suddenly there she was
W: All covered with leaves and dust
W: I couldn't believe it but she followed me
W: Now both of us were lost
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land
W: Was I falling in love or under the spell Of Panama?
W: 
W: The clouds began to rumble
W: We found a dry piece of jungle
W: I don't remember if It rained
W: But I remember making love
W: 
W: So clearly I recall
W: The magic of Panama
W: And surely never will it let me go
W: Yo Soy Panameno
W: 
W: I was not a child I was not yet a man
W: I was trying very hard to understand
W: Indifferent to the dangers of living in a foreign land

W: So I'm starting all over with a tear in my eye
W: I just never thought you'd disappear

W: There's a ship
W: And it sails a sea of light
W: On it's way to me tonight
W: From a distant shore
W: Taking me home once more
W: 
W: And the waves
W: And the whistling of the wind
W: Make me come alive again
W: My destiny's at my door
W: 
W: Going to leave this town forever
W: And go where I'll never
W: Nead an overcoat no more, where they cry ...
W: 
W: Ooh lalalala, every night and every day
W: Sitting by the Gulf coast just a thousand miles away
W: Where they cry ...
W: Ooh lalalala, on an island I will dwell
W: Starlit nights in paradise on the Isle of Sanibel
W: 
W: There's a girl
W: And I see her dressed in white
W: As she lies there in the night
W: I can hear her cry
W: Where has he gone and why
W: 
W: But she knows
W: That someday he will arrive
W: And it keeps her love alive
W: Dreams can never die
W: 
W: She looks across the ocean
W: At sails in motion
W: In the early morning sky, where they cry ...
W: 
W: Angels of the water, sirens of the sea
W: Whispering there sweet love songs
W: Calling out to me

W: Something opened up the gates again,

W: Here comes a mommy and a little girl,

W: Something pushed back the curtain again,
W: The stage is deeper and the crowd is in.
W: The song is gentle, but the song is now.
