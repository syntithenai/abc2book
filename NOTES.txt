The source code for the software is available at https://github.com/syntithenai/abc2book/

The software is developed using the React framework. It is delivered as a standalone web application that works without authentication but relies entirely on Google services for cloud persistence.

The software uses the "Sign In With Google" to gain an Open Auth token for use with other Google services.

A timeout function uses the refresh token to poll and maintain a fresh token while the user is active but the token is not persisted.

The source code for working with YouTube search and playlists uses axios and the REST endpoints to make requests to the YouTube data api.

Specifically
- the https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files apis for storing and retrieving the logged in users list of tunes.
- https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists and https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlists for importing and exporting playlists
- https://youtube.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search for looking up youtube videos
